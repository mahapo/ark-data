in the face of this truth.

Stanley Kubrick used
the opportunity

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle line:84%
of faking the moon landings
to create a work of alchemy.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:84%
It took over 30 years for
anyone to realize this.

Within the tradition
of the great work

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000 align:middle line:84%
of alchemy is the idea that
the initiations, explanations

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and rituals of alchemy
are embedded

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:90%
into many great works of art.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids of Egypt,
the great cathedrals

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:84%
of France are referred
to as "Books of Stone."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there is
a deep knowledge built

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000 align:middle line:84%
into these edifices
that only an initiate

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:84%
of alchemical tradition
can truly understand.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle line:84%
The great architects
and artists,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:84%
many of whom were alchemists
themselves had a very clear idea

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
of what it was that they
were attempting to transmit.

alchemist Fulcanelli revealed

in his masterpiece
"Mysteries of the Cathedral",

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000 align:middle line:84%

of France were built

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:90%
as part of this great work.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, anyone who visits
the cathedrals of Europe

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:84%
but especially France comes
away with this feeling of awe.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But what was his great work
supposed to accomplish?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
The answer to this
important question according

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:84%
to the alchemist was
the very transformation

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:90%
of the human spirit.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Although it is true that
the symbols and the geometry

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
of the cathedrals were designed
so that only a true initiate

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:84%
of the mysteries could really
understand their significance,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
the builders and creators of the
great work knew that everyone

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:84%
who experienced the cathedrals
would come away transformed even

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000 align:middle line:84%
the ones who were not
initiates would still come away

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:90%
with the feeling of awe.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that even
radical atheists are amazed

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and surprised by the
beauty of Notre-Dame

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:90%
or Chartres Cathedral.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:84%
In his book, The Hunchback of
Notre-Dame, Victor Hugo goes

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:84%
into this subject with a
great deal of openness.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:84%
He explains that the
secret great work

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
of human transformation was
built into these books of stone

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that we call the cathedrals
during the Medieval Period

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle line:84%
of European history but
Hugo says the new great book

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000 align:middle line:84%
of nature is not
written on the walls

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:84%
or in the stones of
churches anymore.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:84%
This new version,
this modern version --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
this was in the 1800s -- of
the great work had changed

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
from the symbolic form
to the written word.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Hugo then goes on to identify
the works of William Shakespeare

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
as the new version
of the great work.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
He relates that the great
work containing the ancient

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:84%
alchemical knowledge of human
transformation was wrapped

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
up inside the plays written
by the Bard from Stratford.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:84%
There is plenty of high
strangeness around the man

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:84%
who was William Shakespeare
and the plays that were

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:90%
and are attributed to him.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Whoever the real
Shakespeare was he was steeped

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:84%
in esoteric knowledge
in the ways of alchemy.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Victor Hugo was right.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Any close examination
of the works

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:84%
of Shakespeare reveals all the
very same initiatic knowledge

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000 align:middle line:84%
that is also on the walls
of the Gothic cathedrals.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:84%
There have been many books
that have touched this subject.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Again like the cathedrals the
plays of Shakespeare seemed

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:90%
to transform the audience.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:84%
This occurs even if most of them
are not on the inside as far

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:84%
as the secret initiatory
knowledge is concerned.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:84%
The great work seems to
have an effect on people

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
who don't have any idea of
what it is really about.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:84%
The artists who have
accomplished the great work are

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:84%
the ones that still
live with us today.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare, da Vinci
and many others.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare and the Gothic
cathedrals both have this

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:84%
ability to appeal to
many disparate layers

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:90%
of society and culture.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Both bring about a small
transformation inside the human

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:90%
mind and heart.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:84%
This transformation
makes all of us realize

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that we can do great
and beautiful things.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
That we are more
than just animals.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:84%
That the transformation of the
human spirit from the barbaric

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
to the angelic can only occur
through great works of art.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:90%
It was some time ago

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
when I began contemplating
this idea of The Great Work.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Although The Great Work had been
expressed in stone and later

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:84%
in literature, how would
it be expressed today?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It is without a doubt
that the tapestry

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
of human communication
has switched radically.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Just as it was once
based on the symbolic

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and then later transferred
into the written word,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%
now that literary model has
switched to that of cinema,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:90%
television and computers.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Out of these three new forms

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:84%
of communication cinema was the
most obvious to attract someone

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:84%
who might want to
create a modern version

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:90%
of The Great Work.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
But as I looked out at the
landscape of the history

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:84%
of cinema, I could not find
The Great Work on film,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:90%
at least not at first.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I began watching many classics
in order to see if the director

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:84%
or writer was attempting
to tell us the great secret

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:90%
about human transformation.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Many films and film makers
got close, sometimes,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:84%
to explaining minor
aspects of The Great Work

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:90%
but in the end they all failed.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The works of Orson Welles of
course were the most intriguing.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, even these
failed to achieve the greatness

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:90%
from which I was looking.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Was it possible that The Great
Work had never been transmitted

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:90%
through the cinema?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Was it true that cinema was
just too profane a medium

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:84%
to attract anyone with the right
caliber of mind and spirit?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean consider it would take
nearly a superhuman effort

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
to have all the disparate
talents needed

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:90%
within one film maker.

and that it was Stanley
Kubrick who had made this film.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Eventually I would
come to realize

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and that he knew what he
was doing at every step.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:84%
There are few mistakes
in this film

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:84%
but his greatest film is
also his most perfect.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
It's important to remember
that unlike "Citizen Kane"

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and other great films,
"2001" was a smash hit.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:90%
It was actually the first film

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
where repeat business
kept it going

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000 align:middle line:90%
for months at the box office.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:84%
"2001" took an entire
generation by storm.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%
It was the late 1960s and
the largest generation

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
on the planet was seeing the
film on a ritualized basis.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Cinerama theaters across
the country reported scores

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000 align:middle line:84%
of drugged out hippies
flocking to the theater

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000 align:middle line:84%
on a nightly basis to
trip out on the film.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Strangely though, no one in
the audience really seemed

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:90%
to know what the film was about.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
The film seemed to cause
everyone to come away

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:90%
with a different interpretation

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and no one could adequately
explain the last 25 minutes.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:90%
It was generally agreed

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that this was the most
controversial part of the movie.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Indeed many thousands of hours
were taken up in coffee houses

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and dormitories, in
universities and colleges,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
discussing the various
possible meanings

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:90%
that the ending was describing.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Everyone agreed that
it had something to do

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
with transformation but no one
knew really much more than that.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Even Arthur C. Clarke,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle line:84%
who helped Stanley write the
script didn't understand the

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:90%
unusual ending.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:90%
And Stanley wasn't talking.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
He steadfastly refused
to discuss what

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:90%
"2001" was about to anyone.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
In the rare interviews that he
did give concerning the film,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
he again refused to
discuss the content at all.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Most critics at the time thought

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:84%
that Stanley simply did not
know how to conclude the movie

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:90%
so he contrived this ending.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I can assure you
that this is not so.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:84%
The ending to "2001"
explains everything

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000 align:middle line:84%
that Stanley is conveying
in the rest of the film.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Without the ending the film
would be nearly worthless.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle line:90%
It is in that ending

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
that Kubrick reveals
his deep inner profound

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle line:90%
knowledge of alchemy, gnosticism

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient view
of the spirit domain.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:84%
In 1999, right after Kubrick's
death I first discovered that

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:84%
"2001" was The Great
Work on film.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I searched through
many websites to find

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
out if anyone had
seen the esoteric

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:84%
or alchemical nature
of the film.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I failed to find anyone
who understood it.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like Stanley
built this film so that people

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000 align:middle line:84%
at some future date would
finally understand it.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:90%
It is important

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
to not underestimate Arthur
C. Clarke's contributions

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000 align:middle line:90%
to "2001".

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:84%
After all, the script
is ostensibly based

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:84%
on his short story
"The Sentinel".

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Written in 1953 it tells a
story of a group of astronauts

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000 align:middle line:84%
who discover an artifact
on the moon

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:90%
that is left by an alien race.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Truthfully though, the
movie is more properly based

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
on Clarke's novel,
"Childhood's End".

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000 align:middle line:84%
This fabulous novel is a
science fiction treatment

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000 align:middle line:90%
of an essential gnostic ideal.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:84%
There can be no doubt
that Kubrick had read

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:84%
"Childhood's End" and understood
its real significance.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
By aligning himself up
with Arthur C. Clarke,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick was able to bring in
these gnostic alchemical ideas

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:84%
through the convention
of science fiction.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick unlike Clarke proves
that he knows what he's doing

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:84%
at every step and that this is
the real reason why he's not

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
film to anyone.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick himself invented many of
the special effects in "2001".

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Images of real people moving
around inside the windows

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
of the flying spacecraft
was an ingenious invention

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:84%
that revolutionized the way that
movies would look from then on.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Even Steven Spielberg and
George Lucas admit what they owe

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:84%
to Stanley for his
ground-breaking

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:90%
technical breakthroughs.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Like "Citizen Kane",
the vision and the power

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
of the film changed
the way that all

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:90%
of cinema would look after it.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000 align:middle line:84%
This is true especially
for science fiction films

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
which all seem to pay homage to
"2001" in one way or another.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's begin with a
description of the film

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
so that we can place
everything in context.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
[music] The first shot of
the film is a magical sun,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:90%
earth, moon alignment.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000 align:middle line:84%
We are witnessing the
end of a lunar eclipse.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:84%
The sun is pulling away
from this rare alignment.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
The shot is taken from just
beyond the moon's point of view.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:84%
The earth is rising
over the moon,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
the sound track is the World
Riddle Theme from Strauss'

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000 align:middle line:90%
"Thus Spoke Zarathustra".

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Right away, from the beginning,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick is showing the
viewer The relationship

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:90%
between the writings

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle line:84%
of the philosopher Friedrich
Nietzsche and his film.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Between transformation
and extinction.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Zarathustra is the great prophet

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000 align:middle line:84%
of the Zoroastrians
were the early holders

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:84%
of the great alchemical
tradition.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick is saying that this film
echoes the words of Zarathustra

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
who taught of the
great transformation

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:90%
from the mundane to the angelic.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
most dramatic openings

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the cinema.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle line:84%
It is important to note
that these magical,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:84%
celestial alignments are
dotted throughout the film

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and that they hold a
key to the main theme.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Even after a superficial
analysis of "2001" one realizes

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:84%
that Kubrick is never
doing anything

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:90%
in the film that is spontaneous.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Every shot has a meaning that
Kubrick is attempting to convey

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:90%
in a truly magical way.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:84%
If you see this film,
you will be transformed,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000 align:middle line:90%
he seems to be saying.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:84%
The riddle of the world
will be explained to you

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and the first answer to this
great question has to do

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
with these stunning, magical
alignments of celestial bodies.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the main tenants of
alchemy is that planetary

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and celestial alignments
cause dramatic events

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:90%
to occur on earth.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:90%
One of the most dramatic

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:84%
of these alchemical alignments
are solar and lunar eclipses.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:84%
From the very beginning
of the film,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:84%
there is this magical moment
when the three worlds line up.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Something amazing
is about to happen.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But what is the major
event that occurs on earth

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:90%
because of this lunar eclipse?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it is the film
itself that is being conjured

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:84%
by this solar lunar
magical alignment.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Every time that "2001" is shown,
this lunar eclipse precedes it

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:84%
like an astrological
celestial marker.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:84%
The next shot in the film
is a sunrise taken from down

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the earth.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Where are we and when are we?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Kubrick answers the question

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:84%
with a subtitle,
The Dawn of Man.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the first of four
chapters in the film.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, the process of the
transmutation of the spirit goes

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:90%
through four stages or realms.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick also breaks his
film into four aspects.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:84%
In the green language, or
the language of the birds

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
of alchemy, many of the messages
and writings can be broken

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:84%
down into this type of
four part transmission.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The Quatrains of
Nostradamus, the inscription

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle line:84%
on the mysterious
cross at Hendaye

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:90%
and many other examples show

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle line:84%
that this secret alchemical
language unfolds this way

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:90%
for a reason.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the first of
four parts in the film.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Each separate part will expand
out into more vast realms

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
that mirror those of
alchemy and The Great Work.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:90%
[ Background Sounds ]

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:84%
The next few scenes in chapter
1 show a typical day in the life

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle line:84%
of the ape men who thrived on
the earth millions of years ago,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:84%
they forage for food, cower from
their enemies, mostly portrayed

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:90%
by a leopard and they exist

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle line:84%
in a meaningless never
ending sequence of events

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
that are mostly concerned
with survival.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick has no romantic
feeling for these man apes.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:84%
In a sense they go about their
business without any knowledge

Their only quest
is for food, water.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick even creates a
scene of pathetic wrangling

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
between the two tribes of
ape men over a watering hole.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
There is no violence
in this scene.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Only grunts and gestures.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
The ape men do not
know how to be violent.

The ape men go to sleep in
their cave with the cries

of the nocturnal carnivores
filling they're ears.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:84%
It is a dark and lonely
universe that Kubrick reveals.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:90%
There is no magic here.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:90%
But the magic is there.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:84%
It waits until the dawn
of the next day to appear.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:84%
This scene is perhaps the
most compelling and beautiful

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:90%
that has ever graced the screen.

as it stands like a
sentinel in the middle

of the sleeping ape men.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:84%
The sound track is
playing "Ligeti's Requiem"

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:84%
which sounds more like a
psychedelic Gregorian Chant.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000 align:middle line:90%
This is a religious

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual moment
of great importance.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick is not hiding
this in any way.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:84%
The leader of the ape men
begins to become frightened.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:84%
He jumps up and down and
begins grunting and chattering

as he beholds the
magnificence of the monolith.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000 align:middle line:84%
The other ape men are
awakened by his noises

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and they too see
the black monolith.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000 align:middle line:84%
The entire tribe starts
going completely crazy.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
They dance and scream as they
frightfully contemplate this

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000 align:middle line:84%
strange and beautiful arrival
into their mundane existence.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
The leader of the ape men
who's name is Moon Watcher is

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:90%
beside himself.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:84%
He carefully crawls
over to the monolith.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Moon Watcher attempts to touch
it but his fear is so great

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:90%
that he pulls his hand back.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:90%
One more time as the music

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:84%
on the sound track
becomes more numinous.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:84%
He attempts to touch
the absolutely pure

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and straight edge of
this visiting slab.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Slowly he gathers his
strength necessary

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and his fingers touch
the smooth sides.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick gives this moment
an indefinable sensuality.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:90%
The way that the fingers

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
of the ape man brush gently
along the smooth sides

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:84%
of the monolith are as sexual
as this film is going to get.

With the sacred music mixing

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
with the magical
alignments Kubrick is saying

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that this is a great
spiritual moment.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the lead
ape man, Moon Watcher,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:84%
has gotten up to nerve to touch
the monolith, Kubrick cuts

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:84%
to a dynamic shot of the
monolith lying directly

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle line:84%
under a magical moon/sun
alignment.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:84%
The scene is occurring
just after a solar eclipse.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:84%
The sun and moon
have just parted

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:90%
from their eclipsed point.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Once again an eclipse has
preceded in initiatory event.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what Kubrick
is attempting to tell us.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:84%
The monolith appears when There
are certain magical alignments

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:84%
of the sun, the moon
and the stars.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Again this is a deep
alchemical significance.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick is telling us, flat
out, that the sun, the moon,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and the stars are
directing our destiny.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time in the film

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:90%
that the black monolith appears.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:84%
When one considers the entire
film, it becomes apparent

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:84%
that this is really the
story of the black monolith.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Kubrick magically
cuts out all of human history

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:84%
in the famous shot where the
bone turns into a spaceship.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:84%
In this cut Kubrick completely
dispenses with everything

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:84%
that has happened to the
human race and goes directly

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:84%
to the very next human
encounter with the monolith.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:84%
He does this throughout
the film, the only story

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
that he is concerned
with is telling the story

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:90%
of the monolith.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:84%
First time that this black
stone appears in the film,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000 align:middle line:84%
it is revealed in
a very religious

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:90%
and spiritually styled motif.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:84%
This stone, this monolith, has
invaded the ape man's reality

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and he will be forever
altered by this encounter.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:84%
The monolith is a turning
point in the history of man.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:84%
It is directly intervening
with our history.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It is directing us on a
path that it has chosen.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick shows us that we
don't have all that much to do

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:90%
with these grand decisions.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:90%
They are being made elsewhere.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Someone else is making
them, but who?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Is it God?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Aliens? A false God?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And these interventions are
not necessarily majestic,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle line:90%
noble and wonderful.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Kubrick is

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
clearly showing that this
intervention is a descent

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
in a way, both for the
ape and for the man.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:84%
The next episode after the
monolith appears is the famous

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
scene where Moon Watcher,
the ape man leader is sitting

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:84%
in a pile of animal bones and
realizes again clearly defined

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000 align:middle line:84%
by Kubrick as an intervention
into the mind of Moon Watcher

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:84%
by the monolith that the
bone can be used as a weapon.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000 align:middle line:84%
[music] To the music of The
World Riddle Theme again

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:84%
from Strauss' "Thus
Spoke Zarathustra",

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:84%
the ape man suddenly understands
that he can kill animals

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:90%
by using the bone as a club.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:90%
The very next scene shows

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:84%
that the ape men are no longer
scrounging for seeds and leaves.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Instead they are
eating raw meat,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:84%
presumably from an animal
they have just killed

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000 align:middle line:90%
with their bone clubs.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Finally he ends the [ape
sounds] first sequence

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:90%
with another confrontation

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
between the two tribes
by the water hole.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
This time the Moon
Watcher the leader

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:84%
of the ape men now has
a bone club in his hand.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000 align:middle line:84%
The other tribe goes into
their ritualized shouting

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:90%
and gesturing in order to show

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:84%
that they can dominate
the water hole.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
The leader of the
other tribe runs up.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:84%
He yells at Moon Watcher who
holds the bone in his hand.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Moon Watcher places both hands
on the handle of his weapon

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and strikes the other ape in
the head killing him instantly.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:84%
The leader of the rival ape
men falls to the ground.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:84%
This stuns and frightens
the ape men

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000 align:middle line:84%
in the rival tribe
and they run away.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick then shows the other ape
men in the tribe coming forth

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and pounding their bone
weapons on the body

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:90%
of the dead rival ape man.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Kubrick pulls no punches here.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:84%
He wants you to know that
this first murder is an act

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000 align:middle line:90%
of cowardice.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:84%
He shows the meek ape
men pounding their bones

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000 align:middle line:90%
on the dead body and acting

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000 align:middle line:84%
as if they have done
something incredible

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:90%
in this first act of murder.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:90%
[ Ape Sounds ]

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Moon Watcher, the first
murderer howls victoriously

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and throws his bone
into the air.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:84%
This is where Kubrick
magically transforms the bone

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000 align:middle line:84%
into a spaceship and
rejects all of human history

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000 align:middle line:90%
in 1/24th of a second.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
In his audacity, Kubrick
is telling us that all

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000 align:middle line:90%
of history is meaningless.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:84%
He dispenses all of civilization
as if it was insignificant.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
In a way, that is
the complete point.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000 align:middle line:84%
He is telling us that
the ape man's encounter

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:84%
with the monolith and
whatever is about to happen

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:84%
in this film is vastly more
important than all of the wars,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
famines, earths, marriages,
deaths, disaster, discoveries

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and art of the last
4 million years.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Before going on with the rest of
the film, it's important to stop

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:90%
and address the monolith.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the most important
single aspect of the film.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:84%
It unites all of the
plot elements and it is

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:84%
in a sense the author
of the film.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting and extremely
pertinent to the argument

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that I'm making here that
one understands the meaning

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:90%
of the word monolith.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Monolith comes from the
Greek word MON and LITH.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:84%
MON means one and
LITH means stone.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So the monolith is a direct
reference to one stone.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
This film then is about the
one stone or the single stone.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
Kubrick has made sure

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000 align:middle line:90%
that the stone is black.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, all things that
exist come from the black stone

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000 align:middle line:90%
or the prima material.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:84%
The black stone is the
stone of transformation

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and even more important
to this argument,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:90%
the stone of projection.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000 align:middle line:90%
This is the philosopher stone.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the object
that can change

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:84%
or transmute mankind
according to alchemical lore.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
It is rare and when it makes
an appearance it transforms

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000 align:middle line:90%
the seeker.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:84%
There is little doubt
that the black monolith

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
in "2001" is the
philosopher's stone.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:84%
But what is it that the
philosopher's stone promises?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:84%
The two main gifts of the
stone are that of total gnosis

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000 align:middle line:90%
or knowledge for the seeker

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and the other is the
immortality of the soul.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Does the monolith deliver
on these two great promises?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:84%
We shall see that it completes
both promises before the film

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle line:90%
finally ends.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:90%
In fact the two promises

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:84%
of the philosopher's stone are
what is actually accomplished

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:84%
by the monolith through
the course of the movie.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:84%
There's little doubt that
Kubrick knew this all the time

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and it is not accidental
in any way.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a movie about the
black stone, the prima material

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000 align:middle line:90%
and the powder of projection.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I will show that Kubrick
is actually telling us

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:90%
that the monolith is the film

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and conversely the
film is the monolith.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:84%
The next part of the film, the
second chapter completely shifts

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:90%
in tone from the first.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:84%
We are now in a technocratic
utopian view of the future.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:84%
At first it seems that
Stanley is actually

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000 align:middle line:90%
celebrating technology.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:84%
To the tune of Strauss' "Blue
Danube", Kubrick has us soar

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
through a circular
spinning space station

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
in a futuristic Pan-American
spaceship.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Inside the spaceship
is a lone passenger.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000 align:middle line:90%
He is a man named Haywood Floyd.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
He and everyone else
in the scenes

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:84%
of this techno-celebration
is completely lifeless

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000 align:middle line:90%
and emotionless.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Many critics of Stanley
Kubrick say that he was a man

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
who was seemingly
void of emotion.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000 align:middle line:84%
These critics also claim that
he couldn't get his actors

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
to emotionalize very
well on film.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I fundamentally disagree
with this point of view,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:84%
both in "Paths of Glory" and
"Spartacus" Kubrick reveals

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
that he is capable of showing
a vast spectrum of emotions.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick however wishes to
spare the audience needless

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:84%
sentimental emotion which
he regards as superficial

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:90%
and [assumed spelling] binel.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:84%
In chapter two of "2001",
Kubrick is displaying mankind

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000 align:middle line:84%
in the techno-future
built by the masters

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:84%
of the military industrial
complex.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:84%
From his other films especially
"Dr. Strangelove", it is obvious

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
that Kubrick holds no love
or respect for these masters.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
He shows us that this humanity
imprinted by technology,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:84%
television and the disappearance
of nature is also a nearly void

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:90%
of emotions or feelings.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Humanity has become the same as
the machines that surround them.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000 align:middle line:84%
[music] He is now showing
us the future as envisioned

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:84%
by the same insane technocrats
who destroyed the entire world

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:84%
in his previous film
"Dr. Strangelove".

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000 align:middle line:84%
At first as chapter 2 unfolds
with its vistas and moon bases

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and space stations
we began to believe

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:84%
that Stanley is a soulless and
emotionless a man as the future

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that he is portraying but
this is not the truth.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Stanley is showing us this
world in order to prepare us

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:84%
for the later nightmare that
ensues with HAL the computer.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:84%
[music] In this second chapter,
Kubrick introduces the viewer

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:84%
to visual phones, plastic food
and antiseptic environments.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Everything is void of nature.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact as soon as the ape
man has thrown his bone

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
up into the air at the
end of the first chapter,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:84%
the viewer sees no
more of nature.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Not one animal or
plant grace the screen

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000 align:middle line:90%
for the next two hours.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000 align:middle line:84%
After finally landing
on the moon,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Floyd gives a strange
speech explaining to a group

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000 align:middle line:84%
of military and scientific
bureaucrats how they must keep

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
what they have found
completely secret.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the Americans
have discovered something

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000 align:middle line:90%
of immense significance.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000 align:middle line:90%
"News this important," he says,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000 align:middle line:84%
"could cause severe
psychological problems

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000 align:middle line:84%
with the good citizens
back on earth."

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000 align:middle line:84%
He tells the group of scientists
and military men that humans

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:84%
on earth will have
to be conditioned

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:84%
to accept what it is
that they have found.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Floyd blandly explains
why it is so important

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000 align:middle line:84%
that they must concoct
a cover story,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:84%
a story that says an
epidemic has broken

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:90%
out at the American moon base.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick reveals in this scene
the contempt that our masters

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000 align:middle line:84%
of the military industrial
complex hold for us.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:84%
The truth of something amazing
must be held secret from us

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:84%
until we are conditioned
to receive it.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:84%
This is done with such a
masterful slight of hand

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:84%
by Kubrick that the
implications, the Pentagon,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:84%
NASA or someone is hiding the
most astonishing fact of all

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of the
human race and everyone

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000 align:middle line:84%
on the screen shakes
their head in approval

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:90%
without considering the import

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
of what it is that
they're doing.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sure they're all aware
of the extremely grave potential

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000 align:middle line:84%
for cultural shock and social
disorientation contained

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000 align:middle line:90%
in this present situation.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000 align:middle line:84%
If the facts were prematurely
and certainly made public

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000 align:middle line:84%
without adequate
preparation and conditioning.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000 align:middle line:90%
[music]

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>> But what is it that
the Americans have found?

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000 align:middle line:84%
We discover the secret
in the next sequence

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%
which is also the last
part of chapter 2.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000 align:middle line:84%
In a series of shots simmer
in the memory of the viewer,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick takes us on a tour
of the moon via a space bus.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It is dark but the horizon shows
the oncoming light of the sun.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Even here the men involved
are soulless and lifeless.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Again, the men eat
revolting food

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:84%
as they blandly discuss what is
apparently the most important

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000 align:middle line:84%
discovery in all
of human history.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Apparently a simple magnetic
survey of the moon done

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000 align:middle line:84%
by the Americans has revealed
something was giving off an

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
anomalous signal just five
meters underneath the surface

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000 align:middle line:90%
of the moon.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:84%
The Americans who discover
the signal have dug it up.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:84%
They discovered that it
is a black monolith buried

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000 align:middle line:84%
under the soil of the moon that
is emitting these frequencies.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> [inaudible] What's more the
evidence seems pretty conclusive

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that it hasn't been covered
up by natural erosion

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000 align:middle line:84%
or other [inaudible] It seems to
have been deliberately buried.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Deliberately buried.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:90%
[inaudible]

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>> When it is finally seen,
we find that it is exactly

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000 align:middle line:84%
like the monolith that the ape
men encountered in chapter one.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Who buried it and why?

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Once again Kubrick never
answers these questions.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:35.000 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Again, the men involved with
the discovery essentially the

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000 align:middle line:84%
greatest find ever in earth's
history act in a manner

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000 align:middle line:90%
that is completely binel.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000 align:middle line:84%
They begin snapping photographs
of themselves in front

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000 align:middle line:84%
of the strange black
slab of stone.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:84%
The scene on the moon has been
cloaked in the darkness of night

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:84%
until now but now the
sunrises just over the horizon,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:84%
its light strikes the black
monument for the first time

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:84%
since it was buried,
presumably 4 million years ago.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000 align:middle line:84%
As the light strikes the
monument it suddenly emits a

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:84%
high pitched signal that pierces
through the ears of the men.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, Kubrick has
shown the earth setting opposite

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000 align:middle line:90%
of the rising sun.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It is subtle but there
is a lunar eclipse going

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:90%
on at the precise moment

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:84%
that the monument begins
to emit its signal.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick leaves it
up to the viewer

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000 align:middle line:84%
to decide why this
monument was buried here.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:84%
It is a safe bet that it was
placed by someone in the past

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:84%
in the hope that once humanity
had evolved a high technology,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:84%
they would be able to visit
their nearby neighbor the moon.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Once on the surface, they would
eventually do a magnetic survey

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000 align:middle line:90%
and discover the monolith.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000 align:middle line:84%
It is also a safe bet
that the same forces

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000 align:middle line:84%
that created the first
encounter between the monolith

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and the ape men are
the same ones

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000 align:middle line:84%
who placed the monolith
on the moon.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Now the film takes
another dramatic shift.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:90%
We're in the third chapter.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000 align:middle line:84%
It's titled, The
Discovery Mission

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:90%
to Jupiter, 18 Months Later.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Three of the four chapters
end with the influence

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000 align:middle line:84%
of this mysterious stone
as a point of redirection.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Not just for the story line but
for the entire race of humanity.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:84%
This third part of the
film is the longest

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000 align:middle line:90%
of the four chapters.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:84%
It is also the one
that is most involved

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:84%
with actually telling a story in
the way that Hollywood prefers.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the Discovery
Mission to Jupiter.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Inexplicably, we are on the
ship with two live astronauts

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and three others who were
in frozen hibernation.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000 align:middle line:84%
The astronauts Poole and
Bowman are even more lifeless

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000 align:middle line:84%
and soulless than the people
in the previous scene.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Again there's no
nature anywhere.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000 align:middle line:90%
No plants.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000 align:middle line:90%
No animals.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Just two binel astronauts
who go about their chores,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000 align:middle line:84%
servicing the ship, playing
chess and shadow boxing.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But there is another
one on board the ship.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000 align:middle line:84%
This character actually
seems to have a soul

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000 align:middle line:84%
or at least the beginnings
of one.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000 align:middle line:84%
He is of course the
on board computer

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000 align:middle line:90%
that runs the entire ship, HAL.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000 align:middle line:90%
As humanity has acquired more

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and more technology it has
lost more and more of its soul.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Here in this lonely
spaceship at the outer edge

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:84%
of human experience
the occupants appear

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:84%
to have completely
lost their souls.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, the machine that
they built in which they allow

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:84%
to run their entire
lives has begun

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000 align:middle line:90%
to wake up to consciousness.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000 align:middle line:84%
It is beginning to question
the reasons for its existence

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and the mission which is
something that neither

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000 align:middle line:90%
of the two astronauts ever does.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000 align:middle line:84%
HAL the computer is slowly
developing a kind of soul.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000 align:middle line:84%
This is another one of
those delicious Stanley

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Kubrick reversals.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000 align:middle line:84%
As one thing begins to die
it finds life somewhere else.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in the most
ironic of circumstances.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000 align:middle line:84%
The soul of man if
allowed to continue

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:84%
on its present course would
eventually be snuffed out,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000 align:middle line:90%
probably by the machines.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Just as the ape men would
have become extinct had they

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000 align:middle line:90%
continued on their course.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000 align:middle line:84%
This theme is echoed in
another Kubrick influenced film,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000 align:middle line:90%
"AI" by Steven Spielberg.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000 align:middle line:84%
In "2001", Kubrick leaves us
with a tantalizing possibility

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that machines will
eventually acquire a soul

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000 align:middle line:84%
but the film clearly
states by the ending

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000 align:middle line:84%
that the time has run
out for any of that.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:90%
HAL is mysteriously confused.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:84%
There is something
about the secrecy

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000 align:middle line:90%
of the mission that bothers him.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Later, it is revealed that
HAL is the only one on board

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:84%
that is consciously aware of the
true mission of the Discovery.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Again, Kubrick astonishes
us by showing

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000 align:middle line:84%
that the two astronauts
don't even wonder

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000 align:middle line:84%
or question what it
is they're doing.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000 align:middle line:84%
HAL is the only one
who seems to understand

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
funny going on.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Comparative mythologist, John
Lash points out in his book,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000 align:middle line:84%
"Not in His Image", that the
ancient gnostics had a word

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that they used to denote
the duplication of reality

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000 align:middle line:84%
which was being foisted on
us by the evil false God.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000 align:middle line:84%
The word that they use for this
simulation of reality was HAL.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:84%
In the end HAL revolts against
his human masters and begins

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000 align:middle line:84%
to kill off the astronauts
one by one.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly the beautiful
machines dancing to the music

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000 align:middle line:90%
of Strauss have been altered.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Now the machine is reading
the astronaut's lips faking

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000 align:middle line:90%
technical problems

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately murdering
everyone on board but Bowman.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000 align:middle line:84%
The entire Discovery
sequence ends with the murder

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000 align:middle line:90%
of HAL himself by Bowman.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000 align:middle line:84%
One by one, HAL's circuits are
shut down until he is reduced

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000 align:middle line:84%
to driveling out
a childish version

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000 align:middle line:90%
of "Bicycle Built for Two".

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000 align:middle line:84%
As HAL dies a video of
Haywood Floyd suddenly flickers

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000 align:middle line:84%
on the screen of a
nearby television.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000 align:middle line:84%
The tape has been made for
all the astronauts to view

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000 align:middle line:84%
when they finally awoke
from their hibernation.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Now that everyone on the
ship had been murdered

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000 align:middle line:84%
by HAL it is only Bowman
that hears the final message.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Floyd tells Bowman

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that a mysterious
monolith was discovered

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the moon.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:90%
This monolith emitted a signal

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:84%
that pinpointed the
planet Jupiter.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000 align:middle line:84%
The real mission of the
Discovery is to find

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000 align:middle line:84%
out why this strange
monolith buried

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:84%
by some outside force
sent a signal towards the

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000 align:middle line:90%
planet Jupiter.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>> 4 million-year-old
black monolith has remained

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:90%
completely inearthed.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:25.000 align:middle line:84%
It's origin and purpose
still a total mystery.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Before going on to the
final sequence of the film,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000 align:middle line:84%
it is necessary to
stop for a moment

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and explain why Kubrick is
going with all of this and why.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000 align:middle line:84%
It is extremely important to
know that nothing is wasted.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything is thought
out to the final frame.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to tell us something
with this strange association

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000 align:middle line:84%
of images from our history
and from our future.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000 align:middle line:84%
In the first sequence we
meet the group of ape men.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:84%
[music] They are gentle
vegetarians who are transformed

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:84%
by the monolith, the
single black stone

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000 align:middle line:84%
into tool users who
concur and kill.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick undeniably
wants us to realize

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that these decisions are
being made elsewhere.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000 align:middle line:90%
He also wants us to know

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000 align:middle line:84%
that the monolith
represents these forces.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Superficially he is telling us
that the monolith is not a great

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and compassionate guide
because it was the cause

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000 align:middle line:90%
of the first murders.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000 align:middle line:84%
On a deeper level though he
is also saying that the gift

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000 align:middle line:84%
of the stone is a
very great spiritual

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000 align:middle line:90%
and evolutionary event.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick is not going to let
us get away with a black

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000 align:middle line:90%
and white view of history here.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000 align:middle line:84%
He is telling us that there is a
strange juxtaposition going on.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000 align:middle line:84%
We have outside intervention
that causes us

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000 align:middle line:84%
to shed the limited
view of the reality

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000 align:middle line:84%
but the shedding also
increases our capacity

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000 align:middle line:90%
for violence and control.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000 align:middle line:90%
How can this be?

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:90%
How can a great spiritual

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and evolutionary leap
forward also be the cause

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000 align:middle line:90%
for murder and violence?

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that diametrically
opposed?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000 align:middle line:90%
No says Kubrick.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:84%
One must go hand in
hand with the other.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Great transformations cannot
take place without violence,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000 align:middle line:90%
death And even total disaster.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The human race [ape
sounds] must go

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000 align:middle line:90%
to hell before it can even begin

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
might of the Gods.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And so our introduction
to a wide reality inspired

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000 align:middle line:84%
by the monolith and
realized through the making

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000 align:middle line:84%
of weapons immediately turns
the ape man with a bone

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000 align:middle line:84%
into a spaceman with
a rocket ship.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000 align:middle line:84%
The spinning circular
space station

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000 align:middle line:84%
in the [music] sequence
immediately

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000 align:middle line:84%
after the first chapter
is a celebration

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000 align:middle line:90%
of the gift of the monolith.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Apparently according to Kubrick
there have been no further

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000 align:middle line:84%
encounters with the monolith in
the intervening 4 million years.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000 align:middle line:90%
All of the technology

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000 align:middle line:84%
that graces the screen
is a direct result

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000 align:middle line:84%

all those years ago.

That bone held in the hand

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:84%
of a primitive ape man
has become a space station

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000 align:middle line:90%
and because of this fact,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000 align:middle line:84%
that ape man has become
emotionless and spiritless.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Somehow Kubrick is telling
us that the two must go hand

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:84%
in hand in order for the final
initiation to take place.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick knows that initiations
are not clean and loving events.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Initiations are unbelievably
difficult and dangerous.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Frequently someone gets
hurt or worse dies.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000 align:middle line:90%
And so the gamble

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000 align:middle line:84%
of the monolith has paid
off to a certain degree.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It intervened in our history
to teach us about tools.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Now at the very end of
the age, at the very end

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000 align:middle line:84%
of the millennium mankind
has accomplished much

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:90%
but at what cost?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick is content to
show us that the cost

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000 align:middle line:90%
of this gift is our souls.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we have gained from
the gift of tool making,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000 align:middle line:90%
we have lost just as much

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000 align:middle line:84%
through the slow
death of our souls.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000 align:middle line:84%
As we replace nature
with technology,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000 align:middle line:84%
we also replace our souls and
our sense of individuality

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000 align:middle line:90%
with a high of like mentality.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000 align:middle line:90%
It is also important to note

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000 align:middle line:84%
that when the ape man throws
the bone up into the sky,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:84%
this is the last time that we
see any part of nature again

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of the film.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000 align:middle line:84%
From then on, Kubrick shows
us an antiseptic hospital-like

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000 align:middle line:84%
future implying that this
is the end of the trail

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000 align:middle line:84%
that the bone weapon
began 4 million years ago.

Like a disuse Bowman must go as
far away from home as possible.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000 align:middle line:84%
He must face monsters and
demons and experience things

All of this must be done

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and he must now investigate
the strange monolith

that is circling Jupiter.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000 align:middle line:84%

will be transformed

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000 align:middle line:84%

as it floats among the planet
Jupiter and her many moons.

It is interesting to note that
Kubrick had originally planned

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:84%
for the planet in
the film to be Saturn

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000 align:middle line:84%
but the special effects
department could not make the

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000 align:middle line:90%

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick had to then
abandon Saturn

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000 align:middle line:84%

from the earth than
any human has ever.

He is alone.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Apparently Bowman has been
chosen by the monolith

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000 align:middle line:84%
to be the one who experiences
the final initiation

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000 align:middle line:90%
of the human race.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick consciously has
chosen Ligeti's music

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000 align:middle line:84%
because it evokes a
spiritual religious feeling

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000 align:middle line:90%
within the listener.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000 align:middle line:84%
He brilliantly juxtapositions
the music

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000 align:middle line:84%
with the sacred geometrical
alignments of the monolith

moons of Jupiter.

In fact the very last shot

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:84%
in this sequence is the monolith
crossing at a 90-degree angle

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000 align:middle line:90%
with the moons of Jupiter.

At that moment, the famous
light show sequence starts.

is a gate that allows Bowman

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000 align:middle line:90%
to witness the infinite.

of the monolith and
what it has to offer.

As the monolith gave the
ape man new skills in order

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000 align:middle line:84%
to adapt it can be assumed that
the monolith is still interested

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000 align:middle line:90%
in delivering even more skills

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000 align:middle line:84%

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000 align:middle line:84%
of Hermes the founder
of alchemy.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick was a great chess
player, and this last scene

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000 align:middle line:84%
as a metaphor, not only
for chess as a game of life

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000 align:middle line:90%
but also the coincidence

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000 align:middle line:84%
of the chess board matching
the magic number of DNA

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and the number of hexagrams
in the Chinese I-Ching

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000 align:middle line:84%
which is the centerpiece
of Chinese alchemy.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Bowman realizes as he lays on
his bed at the end of his life

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that he is involved in
a cosmic chess match

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000 align:middle line:90%
against the monolith.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000 align:middle line:84%
When he raises his hand and
points it at the monolith,

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000 align:middle line:90%
he is acknowledging that he has

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000 align:middle line:84%
in a sense been checkmated
by the monolith.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000 align:middle line:90%
In an earlier script, Kubrick

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and Clarke had the
star child igniting all

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000 align:middle line:84%
of the nuclear weapons
that were in orbit

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000 align:middle line:84%
around the earth thereby ending
any threat of nuclear war.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick realized that
this ending was too close

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000 align:middle line:84%
to the ending of his previous
film "Dr. Strangelove"

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000 align:middle line:90%
and decided against it.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Instead the star child
looks down at the earth

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000 align:middle line:90%
as the World Riddled Theme from

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000 align:middle line:84%
"Thus Spoke Zarathustra"
comes on the sound track.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the third time that
we have heard this theme

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000 align:middle line:90%
and this will be the last time.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000 align:middle line:84%
In the book based on the
screenplay by Kubrick

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and Clarke, the star child
looks at the earth before him

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and thinks, there is a lot of
work that needs to be done.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:55.000 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So what is this all
about anyway?

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000 align:middle line:84%
The stone is the great
impetus for the human race.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000 align:middle line:90%
At every turn it comes in

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and saves the human
race from itself.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000 align:middle line:84%
The first time that it
appears it saves the ape men

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000 align:middle line:90%
from certain extinction.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000 align:middle line:84%
The second time it appears,
it saves the human race

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000 align:middle line:84%
from the technological
domination of this age.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Without the intervention

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000 align:middle line:84%
of the monolith this course
would lead to certain extension.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000 align:middle line:84%
The third time it appears it
initiates Bowman into a kind

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000 align:middle line:90%
of cosmic consciousness.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Bowman has been to the end
of the universe and back.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000 align:middle line:84%
He knows that he is locked
in a prison of his own design

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000 align:middle line:84%
which is the meaning
of the last few scenes

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000 align:middle line:84%
in the hotel-like room but
Bowman's ultimate realization

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000 align:middle line:84%
that he is completely trapped is
revealed symbolically by Kubrick

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000 align:middle line:84%
with the breaking
of the wineglass.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Even after all that
he has been through,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Bowman still makes mistakes.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000 align:middle line:84%
The wineglass is
like a Zen Cowen

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000 align:middle line:84%
that illuminates
the mind in a flash.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000 align:middle line:84%
His own fallibility thrust
the scene towards its climax

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000 align:middle line:90%
as the old man dies on the bed

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and sees the monolith
for the last time.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The Great Work of the
stone is complete.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000 align:middle line:90%
There is now a man, a human,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000 align:middle line:84%
who understands the
greater universe.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000 align:middle line:84%
This man also understands
that he is trapped in a jail

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that his own consciousness
has designed.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000 align:middle line:84%
With the realization
of his own fallibility

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and his own trapped spirit he is
finally liberated from the realm

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000 align:middle line:84%
of the hotel prison or
the world of illusion.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000 align:middle line:84%
In that instant he
understands what the book

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000 align:middle line:90%
of stone is trying to tell him.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000 align:middle line:84%
He lifts his hand in a
gesture of understanding and in

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000 align:middle line:90%
that moment he is transformed

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000 align:middle line:84%
without dying into
the star child.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000 align:middle line:84%
The stone has given
Bowman the gifts

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000 align:middle line:84%
that the philosopher
stone has always promised.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Bowman has achieved
complete gnosis or knowledge

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000 align:middle line:90%
and now he has become immortal

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000 align:middle line:84%
by overcoming physical
death and being reborn.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000 align:middle line:84%
In that moment he passes through
the monolith one last time.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000 align:middle line:90%
The earth is ahead of him now

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and he will be reborn
on that planet.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Bowman will be a new human.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Just as different
from Homo sapiens

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000 align:middle line:84%
as Homo sapiens are different
from that ape man who picked

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000 align:middle line:90%
up that bone all that time ago.

ape to man to superman theme

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000 align:middle line:84%
from his Thus Spoke Zarathustra
essays is mirrored perfectly

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000 align:middle line:84%
by Strauss' music
and Kubrick's movie.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick has evoked the
spiritual and physical evolution

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000 align:middle line:84%
of our race and it
has been transformed

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000 align:middle line:90%
by this magical black stone.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:39.000 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick uses alchemical
allegories throughout the film.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000 align:middle line:84%
The obvious analogies are
the celestial alignments

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000 align:middle line:90%
that precede each

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000 align:middle line:84%
of the alchemical
transmutations in the film.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The second main allegory
is that it is a black stone

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that initiates these
transmutations.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Again, this mirrors
the alchemist lore

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000 align:middle line:84%
about the black stone
causing the transmutation

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000 align:middle line:84%
of the alchemist but
there are other hints

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000 align:middle line:90%
that are just as curious.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Bowman is also a name for
the constellation Sagittarius

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000 align:middle line:90%
which is a man with a bow.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000 align:middle line:84%
This on Its own may appear
to be uninteresting but one

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000 align:middle line:84%
of the great alchemical
secrets concerns the position

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000 align:middle line:90%
of the center of the galaxy.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000 align:middle line:84%
This point in the sky
is found right next

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000 align:middle line:84%
to the constellation
of Sagittarius.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000 align:middle line:90%
In fact, the bow man

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000 align:middle line:84%
of Sagittarius is shooting
his arrow right into the heart

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000 align:middle line:90%
of the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Bowman represents
Sagittarius' arrow as it passes

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000 align:middle line:84%
through the center
of the galaxy.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000 align:middle line:84%
This is also echoed later in
the beyond the Intimate Sequence

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000 align:middle line:84%
where Bowman witnesses
an exploding galaxy.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000 align:middle line:84%
What's also interesting is the
use of the Kabbalah in the film.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000 align:middle line:84%
As said before, there
are four great realms

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000 align:middle line:90%
within the tree of life.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick reflects
these realms with each

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000 align:middle line:90%
of the four chapters in "2001".

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000 align:middle line:84%
The first is the earthly
realm represented by Malkhut

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000 align:middle line:90%
which is the Sephirot located

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000 align:middle line:84%
at the very bottom
of the tree of life.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the realm of the
kingdom or of mankind.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000 align:middle line:84%
The second realm up in the tree
of life is that of the moon

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000 align:middle line:90%
or the Sephirot Yesod.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000 align:middle line:84%
The third realm is
that of the sun

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000 align:middle line:84%
with the Sephirot
named Tif eret.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And the final realm of the tree
of life is the ultimate being

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000 align:middle line:84%
or consciousness represented
by the Sephirot named Keter.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Like all great alchemical
works the film "2001" is broken

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000 align:middle line:90%
up into four chapters.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But first the ape man
sequence is the only episode

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000 align:middle line:90%
to take place on earth.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000 align:middle line:84%
This would represent
the realm of earth

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000 align:middle line:84%
or Malkhut according
to the Kabbalah.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000 align:middle line:84%
The second chapter takes
place off the earth

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000 align:middle line:84%
with Haywood Floyd
going to the moon.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000 align:middle line:84%
It finally climaxes on the
very surface of the moon.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000 align:middle line:84%
This chapter represents
Yesod in the tree of life

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000 align:middle line:90%
where the realm of the moon.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000 align:middle line:84%
The third chapter which
concerns the mission

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000 align:middle line:84%
to Jupiter is a little
more tricky.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000 align:middle line:84%
In order to understand
the Kabbalah significance

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000 align:middle line:84%
of this sequence it is
important to understand

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000 align:middle line:84%
that in the original script by
Arthur C. Clarke and Kubrick,

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000 align:middle line:84%
the spacecraft Discovery was
headed towards the planet Saturn

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000 align:middle line:90%
not Jupiter.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000 align:middle line:84%
As stated earlier, Kubrick was
forced to switch to Jupiter

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000 align:middle line:84%
because the rings of Saturn
proved too difficult to create.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000 align:middle line:84%
The special effects
department could not make them

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000 align:middle line:90%
realistic enough.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000 align:middle line:84%
In the original script,
the planet was Saturn.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000 align:middle line:84%
This is very important
because in the Kabbalah,

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000 align:middle line:84%
one can switch places between
the sun or Tif eret and Saturn.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000 align:middle line:84%
In other words Saturn
can be used

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000 align:middle line:84%
as a symbolic representation
of the sun.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Is it a coincidence
that this third chapter

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000 align:middle line:84%
which was originally
intended to be about a voyage

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to Saturn is also
about the third realm

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000 align:middle line:90%
of the Kabbalah, Tif eret?

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000 align:middle line:84%
When one consider this switch
is allowed in the rules

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000 align:middle line:84%
of the Kabbalah,
this sequence comes

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000 align:middle line:84%
to represent the third
realm of the tree of life.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000 align:middle line:84%
The last chapter in this
movie concerns the voyage

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000 align:middle line:90%
to the infinite.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000 align:middle line:84%
In this chapter Bowman
experiences a universe far more

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000 align:middle line:84%
vast and unbelievable than any
mortal man has ever conceived.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000 align:middle line:84%
In the final realm of the
Kabbalah, the seeker can swim

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean of the mind of
God, which is represented

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000 align:middle line:90%
by the Sephirot named Keter.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000 align:middle line:84%
This state of awareness
is similar

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000 align:middle line:84%
to the [assumed spelling] samodi
state from the yogi tradition.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000 align:middle line:84%
This state can be attained
only by a very few people.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000 align:middle line:84%
In this case of this film
final realm of the tree

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000 align:middle line:84%
of life can only be
attained by one man.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And this can be done
only with the help

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000 align:middle line:90%
of the monolith or the stone.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Bowman, the furthest
out and loneliest person

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000 align:middle line:90%
in the universe is that man.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly in the tree
of life, there is an abyss

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that lies between
Tif eret and Keter.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000 align:middle line:90%
This abyss must be crossed

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000 align:middle line:84%
by the initiate before they
can successfully complete

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000 align:middle line:90%
their journey.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000 align:middle line:84%
This abyss is called
dot in the Kabbalah.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Bowman crosses this abyss during
the famous light show sequence,

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000 align:middle line:84%
the colors and the shapes on the
screen are shown in such a way

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000 align:middle line:84%
as to create a falling
sensation in the viewer.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick is taking the viewer
through the abyss of dot

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and into the world of Keter
where all illusions fail.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick has brought
the viewer of the film

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000 align:middle line:84%
through the four
realms of the tree

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000 align:middle line:84%
of life all brilliantly
evoked in the right pattern

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000 align:middle line:84%
with enough intricate
knowledge of the Kabbalah

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000 align:middle line:84%
to give one a long
pause for consideration.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000 align:middle line:84%
It certainly seems that someone
was aware of the Kabbalah

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000 align:middle line:90%
in the making of this film

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and that someone
was Stanley Kubrick.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000 align:middle line:90%
In the end, Kubrick is saying

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000 align:middle line:84%
that Bowman has been the
lead shaman for humanity.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000 align:middle line:84%
He has passed through
the four realms

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and now he knows the
truth about existence.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000 align:middle line:84%
He realizes that life would
be completely meaningless

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000 align:middle line:84%
if it were not for
the intervention

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000 align:middle line:84%
of the monolith or
the black stone.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000 align:middle line:84%
He realizes that he himself
could not be transformed

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000 align:middle line:90%
without the assistance

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000 align:middle line:84%
of an outside intelligence,
a God if you will.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000 align:middle line:84%
This supposedly atheist film
director has made the ultimate

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000 align:middle line:90%
religious movie.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000 align:middle line:90%
It single handedly out does all

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000 align:middle line:84%
of Hollywood's wooden
superficial homages

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000 align:middle line:90%
to the spirit and to religion.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick takes his
religion very seriously

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and he conveys that
in every way.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick has simultaneously taken
the viewer through the history

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, through
the realms of the tree

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000 align:middle line:90%
of life or the Kabbalah.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000 align:middle line:84%
He has shown that
the transmutation

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000 align:middle line:84%
of the human species is
created by the intervention

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000 align:middle line:90%
of a single black stone.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000 align:middle line:84%
He has revealed that this
transformation can only take

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000 align:middle line:84%
place when certain magical
alignments are happening.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore he takes a
viewer on a shamanic journey

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000 align:middle line:84%
that reveals the great secret
in a hidden way to the viewer.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick transformed the
entire baby boomer generation.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000 align:middle line:84%
He opened up vistas
in the mind for them

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000 align:middle line:90%
that had never been seen before.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, he gave an
important spiritual context

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000 align:middle line:84%
to his visions so that
they made sense instead

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000 align:middle line:84%
of just being mindless
hallucinations

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000 align:middle line:90%
and visions that went nowhere.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Almost everyone sensed that
the movie was saying something

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000 align:middle line:90%
of immense importance.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:04.000 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we get to
Kubrick's ultimate trick.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000 align:middle line:84%
He proves that he knows
exactly what he is doing

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000 align:middle line:90%
with this trick.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000 align:middle line:90%
His secret is in plain sight.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000 align:middle line:84%
First one must remember that
every time the monolith appears

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000 align:middle line:84%
in the film there is a
Strange beautiful celestial

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000 align:middle line:90%
alignment occurring.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And one must also remember
that every celestial alignment

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000 align:middle line:84%
in the film is followed by
a visit from the monolith,

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000 align:middle line:90%
that is except for one.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the
lunar eclipse that occurs

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000 align:middle line:84%
at the very beginning
of the film.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So the question arises, if we
were to stay within the rules

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000 align:middle line:84%
that are prescribed in
the rest of the film,

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000 align:middle line:84%
where is the monolith
that is supposed to follow

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000 align:middle line:90%
that very first alignment?

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000 align:middle line:84%
The monolith on the
screen doesn't show

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000 align:middle line:90%
up for ten more minutes

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000 align:middle line:84%
after that first celestial
alignment, so what gives here?

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Is Kubrick just showing off
his incredible special effects?

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Is this first celestial
alignment just there

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to impress the viewer
from the beginning?

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000 align:middle line:84%
These things may very well be
true but this ultimate trick

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of Kubrick's is embedded
in the idea

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000 align:middle line:84%
that the monolith must
appear after every one

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000 align:middle line:90%
of these magical alignments.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Once again the secret

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000 align:middle line:84%
of the film is completely
revealed from the beginning.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000 align:middle line:84%
There is a monolith that appears
right after the opening sequence

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000 align:middle line:90%
with the magical lunar eclipse.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000 align:middle line:90%
But where is it?

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It is right in front
of the viewer's eye.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000 align:middle line:90%
The film is the monolith.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000 align:middle line:84%
The secret that seems to have
never been seen by anyone,

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000 align:middle line:84%
the monolith in the film is
the same exact dimensions

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000 align:middle line:84%
as the movie screen in
which "2001" was projected.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Completely hidden from
critic and fan alike

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000 align:middle line:90%
until now is the fact

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000 align:middle line:84%
that Kubrick consciously
designed this film

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to be the monolith, the
stone that transforms.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Like the monolith the film
projects images into our heads

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that makes us consider wider
possibilities and ideas.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Like the monolith the film
ultimately presents an

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000 align:middle line:84%
initiation, not just to the
actor on the screen but also

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000 align:middle line:84%
to the audience viewing
the film.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000 align:middle line:84%
This is Kubrick's
ultimate trick.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000 align:middle line:84%
He slyly shows us here that
he knows what he is doing

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000 align:middle line:90%
at every step in the process.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000 align:middle line:84%
The monolith and the
movie are the same thing.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000 align:middle line:84%
The monolith also represents the
cube of space or the container

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000 align:middle line:90%
of creation in alchemy.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000 align:middle line:84%
The cube of space is the
container that holds reality.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The black single stone becomes
the container of creation

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and the alchemical
cube at the same time.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000 align:middle line:90%
It is in a way a cubed brick.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Is this another trick

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.000 align:middle line:84%
of Stanley's who's last name
Kubrick, cubed brick mirrors

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000 align:middle line:90%
that concept so clearly?

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000 align:middle line:84%
This black stone of creation is
also one of the main features

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000 align:middle line:84%
in the Islamic religion where
a black meteorite sits near the

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000 align:middle line:84%
[assumed spelling] Kaba
or the cube of space

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000 align:middle line:90%
in the Arabian city in Mecca.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick has combined these many
deeply held spiritual traditions

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and symbols and refashioned
them into the monolith or stone

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000 align:middle line:84%
that is constructed in the same
dimensions as the movie screen

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000 align:middle line:90%
on which it would be projected.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick completely reveals that
he understands The Great Work.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000 align:middle line:84%
The monolith represents
the philosopher's stone.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000 align:middle line:84%
The book of nature, and
the film that initiates.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Stanley Kubrick has truly
made the book of nature

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000 align:middle line:84%
into a film using
powdered silver nitrates

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000 align:middle line:84%
that are then glued onto a strip
of plastic and then projected

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000 align:middle line:84%
onto the movie screens
of our mind.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick has proven himself to
be the ultimate alchemist artist

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000 align:middle line:90%
of the late 20th century.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000 align:middle line:84%
The greatest works
of art are trying

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000 align:middle line:84%
to achieve exactly what
Kubrick is attempting here.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000 align:middle line:90%
With the understanding of what

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000 align:middle line:84%
"2001" actually is saying
Kubrick takes his place

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000 align:middle line:84%
alongside da Vinci and possibly
even Shakespeare as being one

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest artists
of all time.
