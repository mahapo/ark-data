like, we were just
calling you at the hotel.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And we were calling you,
and they said you left,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%

didn't have our cell phone

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just heading
into that room being like,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to go.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
But yet I was there, and I knew
we were supposed to be there.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it was something
I never expected.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.190 align:middle line:84%
It was this feeling
that I can't--

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.770 align:middle line:84%
this is what's
been shaking me up,

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
know what it was,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:84%
but something
happened in that room.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.253 align:middle line:90%
There was this energy that--

00:04:50.253 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that's the only
word I could think

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
of what it was, because I don't
want to say what deep down,

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
it felt like, like
her soul or something.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's this blast of
energy that literally

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:90%
ricocheted around the room.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And you could feel
it in your body,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.612 align:middle line:84%
and almost like I felt like
my hair was blowing around.

00:05:06.612 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:84%
(ECHOING) You could feel it in
your body, and almost like I

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.380 align:middle line:84%
felt like my hair
was blowing around.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the nurses who had
been giving us our space

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
ran into the room, and
she opened the window.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.865 align:middle line:84%
And I was just so relieved
that she did that.

00:05:19.865 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
But while I was relieved, I
was like, what are you doing?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:90%
You're crazy.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.790 align:middle line:84%
This isn't what-- there's
nothing to be relieved about.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.833 align:middle line:90%
She's pa-- it's over.

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Or merely relief that
she's out of pain,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:84%
but I was relieved that the
window was open to let her out.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:84%
The old me would never
use a word like spirit.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.420 align:middle line:84%
This feeling of her
still being around

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:90%
has been really powerful.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's patterns
that go with it.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I'll see 11:11 on the clock,
or 9:11 is another one I see.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> And 22s, and 33s.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And seeing so many of them,
I started researching.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:84%
It's really wild, because my
aunt's birthday is November 22,

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.350 align:middle line:90%
1955.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.380 align:middle line:90%
So it's 11/22/55.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:90%
And those numbers are--

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.680 align:middle line:84%
they already just speak to
a certain weird pattern.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But then finding out about
master numbers, and other kind

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:84%
of things, like 11s, and
22s, and then this number 33.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm like, what
does this number mean?

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:84%
It's attached to a
lot of Masonic stuff.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.280 align:middle line:84%
The number 33 plays out in
their architecture a lot.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The 33 latitude is
important historically

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.650 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of different things.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:84%
The Iraq War took place
there, and the most people

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.740 align:middle line:84%
who have ever been electrocuted
on the electric chair

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.800 align:middle line:84%
is in Phoenix, Arizona
on the 33 latitude.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:90%
There's just all these--

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.883 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, and the pyramids, all
this stuff that's gone on.

00:06:52.883 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I started to
feel like there was something

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what if there's
this huge superstructure

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:84%
of meaning that I've
somehow wandered into?

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.395 align:middle line:84%
And there's signs,
and there's things--

00:07:03.395 --> 00:07:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I believe
there is meaning.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Like underneath things
that we're not totally aware

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:84%
of, and this was the cracking
open of that a little bit.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.470 align:middle line:84%
It was like there was
the world as I knew it,

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.235 align:middle line:84%
and then there's this world
of a different kind of order.

00:07:17.235 --> 00:07:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what creates
these synchronicities.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>> The order.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>> The order.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:84%
That there's a field of
meaning of various types.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:84%
It's related to the
idea of archetypes.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.680 align:middle line:90%
Jung's archetypes, you know?

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and that feels
good, but it feels

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:84%
like it only works if it's
clear, like if it's my--

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
when I'm in this
really sensitive state,

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
things start to get
jumbled up, and I

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.667 align:middle line:84%
feel like there's lots
of clutter in my brain.

00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
the same for you,

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:84%
but it's like, [INAUDIBLE],,
things going on.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.130 align:middle line:90%
So even to get--

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know which I should
do first, meditate then pray,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:84%
or the prayer is to
ask for that clarity.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just-- you get lost,
or I get lost on how to begin.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Prayer is a technology.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.238 align:middle line:84%
And we can use the words
intention or awareness

00:17:02.238 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that have a little bit
less religious connotation

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:90%
or baggage for people.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:84%
But if you're praying for, or
have the intention of healing

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
something specific, you can
track within that journey,

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, this symbol
keeps showing up.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:90%
What is that showing me?

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way of looking
at the world similar

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
as you would your
psyche, or dream space.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, those aren't
separate the way our culture

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:90%
separates them out.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you can begin to
read the world around you

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:90%
as a lucid dream, this is only--

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.785 align:middle line:84%
some people would say this is
only electromagnetic illusion.

00:17:35.785 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>> A hologram.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>> This whole thing is a
hologram that we're projecting

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.820 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness into to
play, or create, or learn.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what
synchronicities could be.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
That's what I keep
seeing things, patterns,

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.460 align:middle line:84%
symbols along the way
of this healing journey.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I see owls everywhere, and
meeting up with you today,

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:84%
you're wearing
these owl earrings.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.385 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like there's one
way of just saying, OK, it

00:18:03.385 --> 00:18:05.180 align:middle line:90%
means wisdom, it means this.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:84%
But it's more-- for me, it's
not so much what it could mean,

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:84%
but that it's just appearing,
the pattern itself.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I think trusting yourself
that you're experiencing

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:90%
what things mean for you.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And even if that seems
weird, that's OK.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And you probably know exactly
what's going on for you.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And know that there are
a lot of people going

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:84%
through this journey
together, and we're all

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.753 align:middle line:84%
really happy to help
each other and share.

00:18:35.753 --> 00:18:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going
through a transition

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.890 align:middle line:84%
to a collective awareness
that American culture has

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.073 align:middle line:90%
lost a lot.

00:18:43.073 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Connection with our neighbors,
connection with the planet,

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:84%
connection with cultures in
the middle of the Amazon.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.215 align:middle line:84%
And as we start to
feel each other,

00:18:50.215 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:90%
we can help each other out.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And like, hey, I have
these resources here.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm starting to understand
that this isn't quite healthy,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.932 align:middle line:84%
this infrastructure we've built
to produce this one thing.

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Now I have the consciousness.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, how can I adjust
my relationship

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:11.860 align:middle line:84%
with resources of ideas,
invention, materials, industry,

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to do something
that's more healthy

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.085 align:middle line:90%
for the whole collective?

00:19:16.085 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a current that's
running through everything.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you bring your
presence to that,

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to be dirty,
or something you need more of.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:84%
You just recognize, oh,
this is a form of energy

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.910 align:middle line:84%
that is part of my being,
part of the collective being.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like you've been
just such a huge help to me,

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.860 align:middle line:84%
inspiring me the
way you're living,

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:84%
because you've taken such
an active role in your life,

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:90%
in your being.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're reprogramming, and
deprogramming, opening up,

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and just being open
to how that goes.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And just what you
said, giving me

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
permission to believe
what I believe,

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and to interpret it my
way, but knowing that--

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.195 align:middle line:84%
hearing that from
someone else is the key.

00:20:01.195 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you're just by
yourself, and saying I'm

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
going to interpret it
my way, it's scary.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Or it was for me, because
it's like, I'm crazy.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But I have someone else who's
happy and driving telling me

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:90%
that, then it's powerful.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Meeting other people also on
this journey is so reassuring.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.280 align:middle line:84%
But as I searched for new
words to explain old ideas,

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and the more I investigated
the signs and wonders tucked

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
into the everyday all around
me, the more started to pop up.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to be an
endless feedback loop.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Was it possible that my
own awareness was somehow

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:84%
connected to these
signs and symbols,

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:84%
or had all my hours of intense
lonely contemplation finally

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.576 align:middle line:84%
caught up with me and
messed with my mind?

which I told you about.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
But I've also been experiencing
deja vu, and weird feelings

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.875 align:middle line:84%
of being in a place that I
had never been in before,

00:21:45.875 --> 00:21:47.250 align:middle line:84%
but I've been
there, I feel like.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm experiencing
time now as non-linear.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Like spiraling nature
of the labyrinth,

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of geometry in
there seems to speak to that.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like, time is
much more pliable, and something

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:84%
we can do something with,
as opposed to something

is kind of incorrect.

13 full moons in a year.

You have these underlying

that you can explore those

through geometry.

oftentimes is to just dig.

It was a simple way of

[CHUCKLING]

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:24.030 align:middle line:84%

evolution is just blind chance,

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that the entire cosmos is
headed nowhere, that there's

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.425 align:middle line:90%
no purpose in evolution.

00:29:38.425 --> 00:29:40.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that scientists have

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.360 align:middle line:90%
proved by rigorous experiments.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.420 align:middle line:84%
It's simply an assumption,
like these other assumptions.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for it
being an assumption

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:49.530 align:middle line:90%
is that nature's mechanical.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Nature's a machine.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.950 align:middle line:90%
The universe is a machine.

Machines have no
purpose of their own.

They serve our purposes,
but by themselves, they

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.380 align:middle line:90%
have no purpose.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the universe has no
purpose because it's a machine.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, evolution
is purposeless.

That's all there is to
it in this argument.

coming from one great mind.

And if so, then I would say
that it's worth keeping in mind

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:84%

whole of their culture.

what comes through them at
this time can be a curative.

that energy was so palpable.

I would walk the lay,

and I became
profoundly disoriented

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and did not know
where my car was.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the person who,
after 50 Dead shows,

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:53.410 align:middle line:84%
takes everybody and
gets them their car, so.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to think about,
what are your preconceptions?

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:84%
What do you bring
into this moment

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.940 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about crop circles?

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.760 align:middle line:84%
There's three categories that
generally people talk about

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.870 align:middle line:90%
with agency.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Alien, spiritual, and
something to do with what

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.180 align:middle line:90%
we are doing to the Earth.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So Jung says "the circle
is a symbol of the self.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:17.140 align:middle line:84%
It expresses the totality of
the psyche in all its aspects.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:84%
The unconscious, the
conscious, the whole of nature.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:84%
The self is the part
of us that feels

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.110 align:middle line:84%
the universal in the
personal, and the personal

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.460 align:middle line:90%
in the universal.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Through the ritual action
of drawing the circle,

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.350 align:middle line:84%
attention and
interest are led back

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.750 align:middle line:84%
to the inner sacred
precinct, which

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.300 align:middle line:84%
is the source and
goal of the psyche,

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and contains the unity of
life and consciousness.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.200 align:middle line:84%
The profoundest
problem," says Jung,

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.610 align:middle line:84%
"afflicting the human
psyche is an imbalance

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:84%
which favors masculine
principles and archetypes

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.010 align:middle line:90%
over feminine ones."

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Our separation today from
the feminine, the mother--

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:59.230 align:middle line:84%
"mater" in Latin-- is expressed
compulsively and unconsciously

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:00.870 align:middle line:90%
as materialism.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:06.190 align:middle line:84%
We're wrapped up and lost in a
narcissistic self-involvement.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:10.480 align:middle line:84%
That is how you become a culture
that destroys your own planet.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.580 align:middle line:84%
We are at the end of
the masculine era.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.980 align:middle line:84%
As we move to venerate nature
and the sacred feminine,

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.790 align:middle line:84%
we give birth to the new story
as we open the rational mind

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:25.600 align:middle line:84%
to the irrational mystery of
the unity of spirit and matter.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I believe that crop circles are
meant to be just as they are--

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:33.040 align:middle line:84%
a mystery that deflates the
ego, yet evokes feeling.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.659 align:middle line:84%
Their artistry
tells us something

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:36.010 align:middle line:90%
about their character.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.300 align:middle line:90%
They're creative.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:41.290 align:middle line:90%
They create in sacred geometry.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:44.739 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the most
beautiful, interesting part

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:50.760 align:middle line:84%
about this agent is that
they seem to care about us.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.190 align:middle line:90%
[SOMBER MUSIC]

00:34:54.190 --> 00:35:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Being in a power place,
I kind of feel spaced out,

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:15.080 align:middle line:90%
and headaches, and other things.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And it feels almost like a
message that I'm being sent.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And I can't even
imagine what it would

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.150 align:middle line:84%
be like to be in a crop
circle, from what you told me,

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and your story about not
knowing where your car was

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.870 align:middle line:90%
after being in a crop circle.

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
the message is?

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Is it a download that you
get right away sometimes, or?

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, part of the message
is that the Earth is powerful,

00:35:37.105 --> 00:35:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and that there's
powerful places.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Some people go into crop
circles, or whatever,

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.167 align:middle line:84%
and they get sick because
they've gone into it

00:35:42.167 --> 00:35:44.210 align:middle line:90%
too early after it was formed.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we're coming back

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to a conscious appreciation
of these mysterious qualities

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.070 align:middle line:84%
of our world, and one
of them is that there's

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
these powerful spots that have
powerful energies on them,

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.238 align:middle line:84%
and it's not all
rainbows and sunshine.

00:35:58.238 --> 00:35:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is
difficult, and painful,

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.405 align:middle line:84%
and we maybe shouldn't be there,
or we maybe shouldn't be there

00:36:02.405 --> 00:36:03.310 align:middle line:90%
at that moment.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Part of the message
of all synchronicities

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.190 align:middle line:84%
is that synchronicity
is happening.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And that there's part of
the world cares about us,

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and that we're consciously
realizing that there is

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.710 align:middle line:84%
a heart-shaped world that we
live in, and that's reality,

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and not this myth, this sick
myth that our culture lives

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.130 align:middle line:84%
in, which is that
we're all just--

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:23.898 align:middle line:90%
there's no spirituality.

00:36:23.898 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
beyond the physical--

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>> We're all alone.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.380 align:middle line:90%
We're separated from each other.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.547 align:middle line:90%
>> We're all alone, exactly.

00:36:28.547 --> 00:36:32.390 align:middle line:84%
That's just-- that's the
lostness of our culture.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:35.660 align:middle line:84%
We live in this mysterious
Earth that is powerful,

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and place affects us, and that's
a victory to even accept that.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Often, when you're talking
about synchronicity,

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.010 align:middle line:84%
which resonates so strongly
with me and my experience,

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that it really is
the experience.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:48.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the feeling.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's about being in
our bodies and not in our heads

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:52.150 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.085 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing as a
synchronicity without feeling,

00:36:55.085 --> 00:36:57.920 align:middle line:84%
whether that feeling is
conscious or unconscious.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.440 align:middle line:84%
The classic Jungian
story is Jung works

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.490 align:middle line:84%
with a patient who is very
caught in the rational mind.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:07.073 align:middle line:84%
And she's working with
her, and working with her,

00:37:07.073 --> 00:37:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and working with the dreams.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the psychological
relationship got to this point

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.970 align:middle line:84%
where it was ready
to break through,

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and she brought the dream
of this golden scarab.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And as they're talking
about this dream,

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Jung hears a tap at the window.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.545 align:middle line:84%
And he opens the
window, and in flies

00:37:26.545 --> 00:37:29.070 align:middle line:84%
the scarab beetle, which he
holds in his hand, and he says,

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.330 align:middle line:90%
here's your scarab.

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:31.130 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.042 align:middle line:84%
>> She had to open
up to something else,

00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:33.875 align:middle line:90%
like something more.

00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:34.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:34.675 --> 00:37:38.030 align:middle line:84%
It can just hit you so hard
that you're just like, I get it.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.890 align:middle line:90%
She got it.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:41.180 align:middle line:84%
That broke through
her rational armor,

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and she was like,
oh my goodness.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:middle line:84%
There is a healing
potential there as well.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:84%
It just might not be the
healing that we want.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom is gross.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It's bitter.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Even on our best moment,
shadows on some of the present,

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:59.450 align:middle line:84%
or there's us that involves
the truth that this is, yes,

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:02.570 align:middle line:90%
so perfect and imperfect.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so hard for me to feel
that sense of belongingness,

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and that sense of
already being perfect.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to feel a sense
of agency in this world.

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But that's, I guess, a matter of
now I'm shifting my awareness.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.190 align:middle line:84%
As you sit around
watching the news,

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.620 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to feel like
there's nothing you can do.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.230 align:middle line:84%
But then when you go
out and find community,

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to
realize that there's

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.950 align:middle line:84%
people everywhere gathering
for peace, and eating together.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:33.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:33.918 --> 00:38:42.150 align:middle line:90%


00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>> All synchronicities,
for Jung,

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:49.710 align:middle line:84%
tended to be moving the
psyche towards wholeness,

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:53.300 align:middle line:84%
towards an integration
of what was unconscious,

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.210 align:middle line:84%
to integrate it
into consciousness.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it's moving us
into a more whole state,

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:03.240 align:middle line:84%
psychically, where conscious
and unconscious come together.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, there seems
to be a telos, a purpose, that

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:12.625 align:middle line:90%
is informing the synchronicity.

00:39:12.625 --> 00:39:21.050 align:middle line:90%


00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:22.820 align:middle line:84%
When experiencing
synchronicities,

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:26.160 align:middle line:84%
as I've been experiencing
for the past couple of years,

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.940 align:middle line:84%
it just feels like I either
make too much out of them

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:34.070 align:middle line:84%
meaning-wise, and just subscribe
all this meaning to them,

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and search so deeply for
how it applies to my life,

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:84%
or else I feel like I
shouldn't pay attention at all,

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's just
meaningless craziness.

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really sure
what to make of it.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Some synchronicities that
are especially important to one,

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:52.620 align:middle line:84%
you can have a personal, oh,
almost there like a treasure

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.630 align:middle line:90%
that you've been given.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Those sometimes
might be something

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that one might want
to keep to oneself,

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:04.890 align:middle line:84%
because Rudolf
Steiner said once,

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:07.830 align:middle line:84%
we must know when
to keep silent about

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.870 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual experiences.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And it can be that some
synchronicities can

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.630 align:middle line:84%
be difficult to convey
to anybody else,

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.650 align:middle line:84%
partly because they're
so complicated.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:21.030 align:middle line:84%
There's so many details that go
into making the meaning that it

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.890 align:middle line:90%
has such power for you.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Plus, you're bringing to the
synchronicity things that

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.170 align:middle line:84%
are personally
significant to you

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that you might not
even be conscious

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.680 align:middle line:84%
of as to why this
particular synchronicity has

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:38.650 align:middle line:84%
so much weight for you
spiritually, personally.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And that can be difficult
to convey to somebody else.

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So this sense that I have
sometimes when I'm experiencing

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.980 align:middle line:84%
a really strong string
of synchronicities,

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.350 align:middle line:84%
that I'm almost like
the star of a movie.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:54.022 align:middle line:84%
And it feels super
egotistical, but it really

00:40:54.022 --> 00:40:55.480 align:middle line:84%
feels like that's
what's happening.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Would you think that's on the
side where I need to unpack

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.250 align:middle line:90%
some ego, or is that--

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Not necessarily.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.640 align:middle line:84%
If you can recognize
that in some way,

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.600 align:middle line:84%
you are the center of
the cosmos's attention.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.540 align:middle line:90%
You are the star of a movie.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:20.700 align:middle line:84%
But there are many other
movies happening as well.

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's many other
stars in this cosmos.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Billions and billions of them.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Everyone's the star.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's something about
the universe's extraordinary--

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I would view it as not only
overwhelmingly powerful

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.930 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, and capacity
to be orchestrating events

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:43.848 align:middle line:84%
in ways that are meaningful
to so many people at once,

00:41:43.848 --> 00:41:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that there's a way
in which there can

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:48.960 align:middle line:84%
be many, many stars,
many, many movies,

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:53.700 align:middle line:84%
many individual solar heroes
are undergoing their journey

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:54.570 align:middle line:90%
at once.

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's just part
of the miracle of life.

00:41:57.330 --> 00:42:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And opening up to that allows
you to hold your own importance

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.330 align:middle line:84%
as a center of
meaning, while not

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:10.710 align:middle line:84%
disparaging the centered
meaning of everybody else.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:middle line:84%
The whole nature
of synchronicity

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:16.860 align:middle line:84%
is one in which archetypes
tend to be present.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.760 align:middle line:84%
The archetypes are
the formal patterns

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.060 align:middle line:84%
that shape the
coincidence of events.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I think there is
something to particularly,

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I think, archetypal
astrological perspectives

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:33.930 align:middle line:84%
give us a handle on
being able to see

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:36.900 align:middle line:84%
what are our particular
archetypal complexes where we

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.170 align:middle line:84%
may be distorting
reality in a certain way,

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:43.530 align:middle line:84%
being in a possession state
of that particular complex,

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:84%
so that we can see ourselves
from outside in both shadow

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.540 align:middle line:90%
form and light form.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And also, at what times.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, when is this
one most likely to be

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.710 align:middle line:90%
activated, constellated?

00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's a very helpful
gift from the cosmos.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of the fact that you
can either use this knowledge

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:10.050 align:middle line:84%
to attempt to control life,
or to participate more

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.430 align:middle line:90%
intelligently in life.

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And those are two
different attitudes

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.070 align:middle line:90%
towards the same information.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's again where a lot
of self-awareness comes in.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Self-awareness and then
working on oneself.

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.500 align:middle line:84%
The more one goes
through deep journeys,

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:30.240 align:middle line:84%
and inner transformation-- and
it could be shamanic sacred

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.280 align:middle line:84%
medicine rituals, it
could be Jungian analysis,

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.500 align:middle line:84%
it could be meditation,
holotropic breath work,

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:41.940 align:middle line:84%
whatever is one's practice
for self-exploration--

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:47.280 align:middle line:84%
these allow us to become more
and more able to basically

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:50.610 align:middle line:84%
trust the cosmos, trust
life, trust the universe,

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:52.320 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
through enough times

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.740 align:middle line:84%
where we've been
pushed down, pushed

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.360 align:middle line:84%
through the dark
night of the soul,

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and discovered
there's more to it.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Trusting, less anxious
engagement with life.

>> You know, Ram Dass
tells this story--

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I think it's Ram
Dass-- tells this story

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:20.790 align:middle line:90%
about going to a dinner party.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's this feast of people
all sitting together, having

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.150 align:middle line:90%
conversation.

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:30.600 align:middle line:84%
But the under-conversation
is everybody

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.120 align:middle line:90%
asking the same question.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.840 align:middle line:90%
What about me?

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:90%
What about me?

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:39.720 align:middle line:90%
What about me?

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think you could
interpret this as a sort of--

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:50.280 align:middle line:84%
an expression of the
narcissism of our times,

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that we're so
self-focused, that nature

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:59.535 align:middle line:84%
is treated as kind of a
backdrop to the human drama.

00:44:59.535 --> 00:45:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's another
interpretation of the "what

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.360 align:middle line:90%
about me" phenomenon.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And it is that there
is this story needing

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.589 align:middle line:90%

of it has been that

00:45:38.345 --> 00:45:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the ocean, and there's
a sense that something is

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:45.120 align:middle line:90%
happening pretty drastic.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.300 align:middle line:84%
The most recent thing
is I'm in the water,

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and there's all
this debris around,

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:52.910 align:middle line:84%
including bodies of people
that I can't totally see,

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.860 align:middle line:90%

Hmm.

Wow.

only trying to get to the shore

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:09.390 align:middle line:90%
myself, because that's--

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a great swimmer,
and I know that in the dream

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.250 align:middle line:90%
too, so I'm scared.

To be like, you're not a nice
person, or you're-- so yeah.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.190 align:middle line:84%
There is that feeling,
that juxtaposition

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:16.370 align:middle line:84%
of keeping myself safe but
wanting to help others.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.670 align:middle line:84%

fail at the latter

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think, though,
the part that,

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:41.280 align:middle line:90%
in the dream, again, that just--

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.770 align:middle line:90%
if it was just me, it would be--

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:48.830 align:middle line:84%

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm almost scolding
myself for having

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:58.160 align:middle line:90%
the dream a little bit.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And lately, I've been
just trying to accept it,

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.970 align:middle line:84%
because I've become so used
to this recurring dream.

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:06.980 align:middle line:90%
But it's more now the--

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.280 align:middle line:84%
it's recognizing that I've
always been scolding myself,

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.630 align:middle line:84%
in a way, for having it at
all, which is-- it's like,

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:20.460 align:middle line:84%
what's wrong up here to
make these messed-up images.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I think one of
the reasons people

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:30.380 align:middle line:84%
really shy away from remembering
their dreams is this very

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:35.030 align:middle line:84%
false notion that we are
somehow perverted, or twisted

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.740 align:middle line:90%
for having these darknesses.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But we are surrounded by
death, and debris, and horror.

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:48.350 align:middle line:84%

that we live in.

You drive yourself really
hard to attend to that, right?

00:49:03.717 --> 00:49:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
it's like you're

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.670 align:middle line:84%
coming into this
awareness of, oh, I

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:10.890 align:middle line:90%
need to be kind to myself.

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I need to remember
that I'm good.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:16.610 align:middle line:90%


00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:19.685 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
will be most of service

00:49:19.685 --> 00:49:28.510 align:middle line:84%
to all of that insufficiency,
and horror that

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.010 align:middle line:90%
surrounds us all.

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think the gateway
for you to healing

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.870 align:middle line:90%
is kindness to yourself.

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Be who you are.

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:43.170 align:middle line:84%
You can just radiate
from that place,

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and it will affect
enormous ripples.

>> Oh, thank you.

00:49:49.655 --> 00:49:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's interesting how hard
it is to be kind to myself.

>> It's a practice.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.300 align:middle line:84%

To think of ourselves only
as agents of production

consider the vast potential

of being a human

with wholeness

that ayahuasca is offering us.

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And part of that
reunification with wholeness

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.430 align:middle line:90%
involves healing.

That is where-- our science,
our Western materialist science,

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:55.660 align:middle line:84%
wants to explain all healing in
terms of medicines, and pills,

00:52:55.660 --> 00:53:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and surgical procedures that
are given to us, whereas really,

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:03.760 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful agency
of healing is the mind.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.850 align:middle line:84%
We need a powerful force
at work by our side

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:11.590 align:middle line:84%
if we are to overcome the
chains that presently wrap up

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:13.807 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness, unlock
it in a particular place.

00:53:13.807 --> 00:53:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that ayahuasca does
have the potential to do that.

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And if we are to get
back on our true course,

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:20.730 align:middle line:84%
then we need to know
what our true course is.

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And part of that comes
from the study of the past,

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and from unraveling the past,
and from filling in the missing

from that state
of forgetfulness,

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and remember who we are, and
know what our potential is, so

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.540 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have to be
deluded into believing

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that our only function is
to produce and consume.

if we uncover the past,

that although societies

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:41.320 align:middle line:84%
at the large scale seem
almost impossible for us

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.560 align:middle line:84%

over, we can always

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.920 align:middle line:84%

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.980 align:middle line:84%

we impact directly.

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:52.720 align:middle line:84%

every one of us should

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:57.070 align:middle line:84%
start the work, in how we
are with our own lives,

00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:59.530 align:middle line:84%

in the course of our lives.

that better, if we

can make that better, if we
can make who we are better,

01:02:57.710 --> 01:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
For myself, when I'm
doing that kind of work,

01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot of
stepping into unknown,

there's perceived judgment.

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's when something
about that courage and stepping

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
into something seems
to have a response,

01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and a recall of what we're
calling synchronicity,

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%

the playfulness

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.390 align:middle line:90%

a neurophysiological basis
to initiatory experience,

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:26.642 align:middle line:84%
that actually, the
prefrontal cortex,

01:06:26.642 --> 01:06:28.850 align:middle line:84%

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:43.520 align:middle line:84%
of culturally-induced experience
to reach its full unfolding,

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
which is to go beyond
the egoic condition

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
where we're interested
in our own self-interest,

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:52.930 align:middle line:84%
to have a more transpersonal or

obviously, you

so the walkabout,
or the vision quest,

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.630 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, the
fasting, the ordeal,

01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:04.430 align:middle line:84%
would force the
individual to break

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:06.500 align:middle line:84%
through the layer
of the egoic mind

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:10.357 align:middle line:84%
and access this more
universal frame of reference.

01:07:10.357 --> 01:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
So then they would come
back into the tribe,

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:15.065 align:middle line:84%
and they'd be able to
take responsibility

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:16.940 align:middle line:84%

that people haven't gone

awakening, so now I

01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:16.990 align:middle line:90%
understand more of what it is.

01:17:16.990 --> 01:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So right now, you
can all see my face.

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:22.390 align:middle line:90%
I can't see my own face.

01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So what I think is that the
world that I see, just like I

01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:30.940 align:middle line:84%
would need a mirror to see
my physical appearance,

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I need all of you to be a
mirror for my consciousness.

01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Synchronicity is a connector.

01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's showing that
we're all connected.

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the
beauty of that has

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
been to increase what
I call sync awareness.

01:17:43.570 --> 01:17:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So I try to be aware
of synchronicities

01:17:46.690 --> 01:17:51.460 align:middle line:84%
as they happen, and I try to
use social media to put them

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.800 align:middle line:84%
back out there and
talk about them,

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.110 align:middle line:84%
because I've found that the
more you put it out there,

01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:57.850 align:middle line:84%
the more it amplifies
in your life.

01:17:57.850 --> 01:18:00.250 align:middle line:84%
The act of talking
about synchronicity

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:02.200 align:middle line:84%
seems to spin off
more synchronicities.

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I am convinced 100%
that in this room,

01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:09.313 align:middle line:84%
we'll have conversations, we'll
talk about our synchronicities,

01:18:09.313 --> 01:18:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and that it's going to
happen where people are going

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.855 align:middle line:84%
to leave this room and have
each other's synchronicities,

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and see the same things that
someone else has been talking

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:19.410 align:middle line:84%
about, or have dreams
with certain images in it.

01:18:19.410 --> 01:18:21.070 align:middle line:90%
It will happen.

01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>> My record that actually
brought me to meet Diana is

01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:28.000 align:middle line:90%
called reflector.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So we share that
belief in the fact

01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
that what you are looking
at, or what you are noticing,

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:36.250 align:middle line:90%
is yourself.

01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:39.130 align:middle line:84%
The best synchronicity
I can experience

01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
is my ability to be in
sync with other people.

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:48.970 align:middle line:84%
There is a whole society,
culture that I live in,

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:51.160 align:middle line:90%
that we are not in sync.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Creativity is like the
backbone to the synchronicity,

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:57.880 align:middle line:84%
because we're all just
swimming in it all the time.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
You just have to take the time
to not be distracted, or focus

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.000 align:middle line:84%
to not be distracted
enough to flow with it.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.383 align:middle line:90%
And it screams at you, like--

01:19:08.383 --> 01:19:10.550 align:middle line:84%
a metaphor that I use all
the time, because I ride--

01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:11.940 align:middle line:90%
cycle the city.

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you go the wrong
way up a one-way street,

01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:16.780 align:middle line:90%
you feel the resistance.

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:18.810 align:middle line:90%
It's very clear.

01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's no water there, but
I can feel it, like on my body,

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:23.150 align:middle line:90%
I feel pressure.

01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Not just the intensity of
riding in the situation.

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're all affecting
each other in that way.

01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
It's making more
subtle levels, and--

01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:36.490 align:middle line:84%
visually, or physically,
through certain senses.

01:19:36.490 --> 01:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
that visceral sense

01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:41.730 align:middle line:84%
where, oh, there's
a connection here.

Oh, Uriel is here.

01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Angel of wisdom.

It's shape-shifting.

01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%

01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:05.250 align:middle line:84%
to use maybe plant medicines

01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:08.790 align:middle line:84%
been doing, which is something
which was, at first, out

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.980 align:middle line:84%
of alignment with
my initial recovery

01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So now, I do want to
