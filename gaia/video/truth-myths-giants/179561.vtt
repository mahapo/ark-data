00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In the summer of 1520,
the Spanish expedition led

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.490 align:middle line:84%
by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand
Magellan was well into its

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.320 align:middle line:90%
circumnavigation of the globe.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.780 align:middle line:84%
By the time they reached
the shores of Argentina,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.360 align:middle line:84%
they had already encountered
several native tribes.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But there was something special
about the natives of this land.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:10%
And the account from Antonio
Pigafetta, the voyage's

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.770 align:middle line:10%
official chronicler,
would capture

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:10%
the imaginations of
Westerners for years to come.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:84%
According to his journal,
the natives of Patagonia

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.640 align:middle line:90%
were giants.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.386 align:middle line:90%

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Myths and legends
of giants go back

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:84%
through every culture in
every corner of the world.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, the
mythological aspect

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:90%
of these giants is obvious.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Take, for example, Atlas, the
giant from Greek mythology,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
who was tasked with holding
the world on his shoulders.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, the stories
aren't so heavily exaggerated.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And there is even evidence that
giants did once walk the Earth.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.430 align:middle line:84%
In the 1800s, as
European settlers

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.340 align:middle line:84%
continued to expand west
across the United States,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:84%
they started coming
across earthen mounds that

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
had been constructed by native
inhabitants of North America.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:10%
The settlers started
excavating the mounds,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:10%
with little regard for
the native cultures, who

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.430 align:middle line:10%
had built them for religious,
ceremonial, and burial

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:10%
purposes.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And the sensational
headlines regarding

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:84%
what was found in those mounds
all reported one thing--

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:90%
skeletons.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.060 align:middle line:10%
Giant skeletons.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:10%
But these weren't just
a few obscure papers.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle line:10%
These were reputable sources,
like the "New York Times"

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:10%
and "Scientific American."

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:10%
Even Abraham Lincoln
references the giants in 1848

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:10%
during a visit to
Niagara Falls, saying,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:10%
"The eyes of that species
of extinct giants,

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:10%
whose bones fill the
mounds of America,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.237 align:middle line:10%
have gazed on Niagara
as ours do now."

00:01:55.237 --> 00:01:57.070 align:middle line:10%
According to the numerous
articles published

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:10%
during this time, the
skeletons were regularly

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:10%
found to be between
7 and 10 feet tall.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.022 align:middle line:84%
And some even reported
taller individuals,

00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
like the one mentioned
in this "New York Times"

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.915 align:middle line:90%
article from 1885.

00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:09.414 align:middle line:10%
"If the whole frame
is in proportion

00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:10%
to two thigh bones
that were found,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:10%
their owner must have
stood at 14 feet high.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
A representative of the
Smithsonian Institution

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:84%
is here investigating
the curious relic."

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle line:84%
The fact that it was
being investigated

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.100 align:middle line:84%
by a representative
of the Smithsonian

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.080 align:middle line:84%
may not seem out
of the ordinary,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
but it appears to be a theme
seen throughout these reports.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that
the Smithsonian

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:84%
was involved in covering
up these artifacts, which

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
were often surrendered to
the museum for further study.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:10%
This theory is
supported by the fact

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.935 align:middle line:10%
that no studies or exhibitions
follow the initial reports

00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:10%
of these anomalous discoveries.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:10%
And the accounts become
even more compelling

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:10%
when you consider how
many oral traditions

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.190 align:middle line:10%
of the Native American
tribes in those regions

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:10%
tell of a race of giants.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.205 align:middle line:84%
In a more recent
discovery, 205 graves

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
were unearthed in China's
Shandong Province.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:84%
The archaeological dig found
that a significant number

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
of these men stood
around the 6' mark,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
with the tallest man
standing at 6' 3".

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Now this may not seem incredibly
tall by today's standards.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
After all, the average
height of today's NBA player

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:90%
is around 6' 7".

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.750 align:middle line:84%
But 5,000 years ago when these
Longshan people were still

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:84%
alive, they would
have loomed over

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:84%
their Neolithic
contemporaries, who were

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:90%
much shorter by comparison.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
The Central American
Mayans, for example,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:84%
had an average male
height of 5' 2",

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and an average female
height of 4' 8".

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.161 align:middle line:84%
The giants of Longshan were
unusually tall for their time,

00:03:31.161 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:84%
but their height wasn't
out of the realm of what

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:84%
we consider possible
within the established

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:90%
narrative of our past.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when we find
evidence that could completely

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:90%
upend that narrative?

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, miners
in the Otavi Mountains

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:84%
of northern Namibia discovered
the fossilized segment

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:90%
of a femur.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
The mineralized
bone was turned over

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
to Phillip Tobias, the
late paleoanthropologist

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.360 align:middle line:90%
from South Africa.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And it remains in his vault at
Wits University in Johannesburg

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.300 align:middle line:90%
to this day.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:10%
In Michael Tellinger's
video, posted in 2013,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:10%
he visits Professor
Francis Thackeray

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:10%
at the university to view
the impressive artifact.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
The professor identifies
the mineralized bone

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.456 align:middle line:84%
as having belonged
to a homosapien.

00:04:10.456 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:10%
And when he brings out
an average-sized femur

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.010 align:middle line:10%
for comparison, the
difference is clear.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:10%
The fossilized femur appears
to be at least twice the size

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:10%
of the normal one.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.380 align:middle line:10%
But despite the
abnormal size, there

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:10%
seems to be no outside
interests in studying or dating

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:10%
the artifact.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:10%
One piece of femur
doesn't exactly

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:10%
amount to proof of
a race of giants.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.920 align:middle line:84%
But anthropologists
agree that there

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:84%
are large gaps in the
fossil record that

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:90%
mask absolute truths.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Even the researchers who
completed the largest

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:84%
study of hominid body
size throughout evolution

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:84%
sometimes had to estimate
heights based off fragments

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:90%
as small as a single toe bone.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.511 align:middle line:84%
How would our
evolutionary tree differ

00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
if they had recovered
fragments of someone

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:84%
like Robert Wadlow, the tallest
man in recorded history.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Known as the "Giant
of Illinois,"

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Wadlow reached a height at 8'
11" before his death in 1940.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
He suffered from hyperplasia
of his pituitary gland, which

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:84%
results in an abnormally high
level of human growth hormone.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And most of the well-known
giants of our time

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:90%
suffered from similar disorders.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
This photo shows Wadlow
standing next to his father.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Harold Wadlow was a man on the
taller side of average at 5'

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.330 align:middle line:90%
11".

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:84%
But standing next to his son,
he appears almost dwarf-like,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:84%
with his head coming up
just over his son's waist.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And this comparison
happens to be

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:84%
reminiscent of the
giants of Patagonia.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
The following excerpt is from
Antonio Pigafetta's journal.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:84%
"But one day, without
anyone expecting it,

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
we saw a giant who
was on the shore.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was so tall
that the tallest of us

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:90%
only came up to his waist."

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
The account goes on to say
that two of these giants

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:84%
were seized as hostages but
didn't survive the journey

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:84%
back to Spain, which may sound
like a convenient coincidence.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But considering that only
18 of the 270 men who

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%
began the voyage made it back
alive, their odds of survival

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:90%
weren't so great to begin with.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Even Magellan himself
didn't make it back.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:84%
60 years later, when Sir Francis
Drake made it to Patagonia

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:84%
during his
circumnavigation, his nephew

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:84%
wrote that Magellan
had exaggerated

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:84%
the height of these
natives, stating

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that the men were only
five cubits, which

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:90%
is 7 and 1/2 feet.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So even by today's standards,
these were massive people.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
We may never know if a race
of giants walked the earth

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
or know for sure
how much truth there

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
is to the giant
mythologies present

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:90%
throughout every culture.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But consider this--
most animals that

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
walk the earth today have a
giant prehistoric ancestor.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Great white sharks
have the megalodon,

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.880 align:middle line:84%
who beats their size
by about 40 feet.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
titanoboa, a snake which

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:90%
reached 42 feet in length.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Even sloths had a giant
ancestor, the megatherium,

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle line:84%
