00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Like many ancient
civilizations,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.830 align:middle line:84%
the Maya appeared in Yucatan,
seemingly out of nowhere,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:84%
when a star in the Pleiades by
the same name was seen rising

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:90%
before the sun around 3100 BC.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:84%
But a number of recent
underwater discoveries

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.720 align:middle line:90%
tell a very different story.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Around the coast, mile
after mile of tunnels

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:84%
reveal a world
submerged by rising seas

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.230 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the Ice Age.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
In these tunnels were found
human remains and Mayan

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:84%
artifacts proving that a culture
was already established here

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:90%
6,000 years earlier.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
The name Maya means
"water people."

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it is a clue
to their true origin.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.970 align:middle line:84%
According to the sacred
book "Chilam Balam,"

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:84%
the ancestors of
the Maya arrived

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.600 align:middle line:84%
by boat in 9600 BC from a
large island to the east

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:84%
called Atil or Atitlan, where
it is said the waters swallowed

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:90%
the source of wisdom.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:84%
A catastrophe destroyed
their island home,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.725 align:middle line:84%
forcing its divine
survivors to sail west.

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
The "Chilam Balam" refers
to these first inhabitants

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:84%
as Kanuul, the people
of the serpent.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:84%
They were led by three God
men: Kukulkan, Quetzalcoatl,

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and Itzamna, each of
whom led seven sages all

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:84%
charged with the
rebuilding of civilization.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:84%
When they arrived
in Yucatan, they

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:84%
called it Mayab, "the
land of the few,"

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.614 align:middle line:84%
probably in honor of the
survivors who found themselves

00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:10.414 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:02:10.414 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.690 align:middle line:84%
It is said that
Itzamna and his crew

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:84%
brought the understanding of
mathematics and the stars,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.830 align:middle line:84%
of jade carving,
agriculture, architecture,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and sacred knowledge,
thus explaining

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:84%
how the Maya appeared with
a pre-packaged civilization

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.630 align:middle line:90%
and a fully developed cosmology.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:10%
What's more astonishing is
that hardly anyone has ever

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.170 align:middle line:10%
heard of Itzamna and his
sages the Itz, the water

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:10%
wizards, people who
came from the sea

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:10%
with knowledge of the laws of
nature and how to bend them.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
This is their story, how their
progeny became known as Maya,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and how the temples of
Yucatan and Guatemala

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
today are the final
expression of a project 9,000

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:90%
years in the making.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.256 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:07.256 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:10%
The Maya were under no
illusion that Itzamna,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:10%
along with his
counterpart Quetzalcoatl,

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:10%
was a real person, because
he is unambiguously

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:10%
described as "a fair
and ruddy complexioned

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.370 align:middle line:10%
man with a long beard, a
white man with strong body,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:10%
broad forehead,
large eyes who came

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:10%
from across the ocean in
a boat that moved itself

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:10%
without paddles."

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The cult of Itzamna was based
on nonviolence, compassion,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:90%
and humility.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:84%
It was such a cornerstone
of Maya cosmology

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
that the image of these
gods riding a canoe

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
was still used in ceremonial
art up until the historic era.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Collectively known
as the paddler gods,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
they were sometimes represented
as zoomorphic figures riding

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:84%
a canoe that sailed along
the Milky Way towards Orion,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
which itself was considered
the origin of the gods,

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:84%
not to mention the hearth
of creation itself.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.760 align:middle line:84%
After arriving in Yucatan,
Itzamna and his water wizards

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.986 align:middle line:84%
established a town that still
bears their name, Izamal.

00:04:54.986 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:84%
While visitors flock to
more popular locations,

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.930 align:middle line:84%
few are aware that
the largest pyramid

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.645 align:middle line:84%
in this corner of Central
America is found here.

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Even though mostly destroyed
and used as a quarry

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
by incoming Spanish
Catholic priests,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.260 align:middle line:84%
the scale of the Sun
pyramid is still impressive.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Walking up, it is possible
to see the exposed

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:90%
megalithic core.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Nine levels once
spread over two acres,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:84%
followed by a curved mound
of a further nine levels.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.165 align:middle line:84%
According to folklore, the
head of Itzamna is buried here.

00:05:41.165 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
more to Izamal.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Among its gardens
and plazas, light

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:90%
hints of its past grandeur.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:10%
A vast temple city
that once comprised

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:10%
seven pyramids and temples
covering 20 square miles.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Six raised sacred
roads, or sacbe,

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:84%
linked Izamal to other
Maya cult centers,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
making this a focal
point of Yucatan.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
In the western section of what
used to be the central plaza

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
lies a second
impressive pyramid,

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Itzamatul, claimed to be the
resting place of Itzamna's

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.720 align:middle line:90%
heart.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
When the explorer
Arthur Catherwood

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:84%
came across a third
pyramid in 1915,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:84%
he noted how it was still
covered with stucco masks

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.185 align:middle line:84%
and elaborate symbols along with
the 7-foot-tall head of Itzamna

00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:37.985 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:06:37.985 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.060 align:middle line:84%
The southern section
was once marked

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:84%
by another colossal
structure, Pop-Hol-Chac.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Faced with the superhuman
task of destroying the largest

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
temple complex in Yucatan,
the arriving Spaniards

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.580 align:middle line:84%
simply leveled the pyramid
and used its masonry

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to build a Franciscan
monastery and other buildings.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Part of its original
stonework can still

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.260 align:middle line:84%
be seen throughout
the monastery.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.280 align:middle line:10%
The fact that the Spanish
made this the most important

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:10%
of Catholic bishoprics as well
as the center of pilgrimage

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:10%
reveals the importance of
Itzamna's teachings, his temple

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:10%
city, and why both had to
be convincingly subjugated.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:84%
But in doing so, they
left a major clue

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:90%
as to the origin of Izamal.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.230 align:middle line:84%
As a rule, Catholic churches
must face east-west.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Whenever they deviate,
it is a sure sign

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
they conceal an
original structure.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Here, the Franciscan
church sits above a cenote,

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
a Maya ceremonial cave over
which the original site was

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:84%
built. Since ancient
temples memorialize

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:84%
their date of
construction by facing

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:84%
the rising of a particular star,
the church's unusual alignment

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:84%
gives away the date
of the temple--

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:84%
the winter solstice in
9600 BC, the very date

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:84%
given in Maya texts
for the arrival

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.140 align:middle line:90%
of Itzamna and his magicians.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:84%
In the west of the
Yucatan Peninsula

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:84%
lies another major
temple complex,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Itzna, the House of Itza,
today known as Edzna.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:84%
Enormous structures
and staircases

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.159 align:middle line:84%
frame a central
courtyard, marking

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.820 align:middle line:90%
the arrival of two sacbe.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:84%
One links to the Gulf of Mexico
and continues under the sea,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating the truly ancient
foundation of this empire.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.390 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
A huge elevated structure
with broad central stairway

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.530 align:middle line:84%
forms a dramatic entrance
to the Grand Plaza,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.710 align:middle line:84%
a restricted section for
those who observed the rules

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:90%
and customs of sacred space.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:84%
The Plaza served
as a focal point

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:84%
for honoring the
traditions established

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
by the Itz and the
Maya, with festivities

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:84%
held to coincide with
specific stellar events,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
such as the solar return
of Venus every 52 years.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
The divine bloodline of
the Itz continued here

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:84%
until the seventh century,
with Lady Jut Chanek.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Her title, Serpent
Star, identifies her

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.670 align:middle line:84%
as a progenitor of
the original Kanuul,

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.855 align:middle line:90%
the people of the serpent.

00:09:34.855 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Towering over the plaza
is a five-step pyramid.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Its 40 degree elevation reflects
the angle of the nonagon,

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:84%
the nine-sided geometric figure
symbolizing utmost perfection.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.050 align:middle line:84%
The building was designed
to serve as an academy

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:84%
where teachings concerned with
enlightenment were conducted,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:84%
each chamber dedicated
to individual topics.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Maya glyphs set into the
staircase remind initiates

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:90%
of their responsibilities.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Among other buildings
is the Temple of Masks.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
It features the sun god Ahau,
whose face is illuminated

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:84%
by the sun in May
and August, marking

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
the festivals of fertility and
harvest, known to the Celts

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:90%
as Beltane and Lammas.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Ahau is an unusual
Maya name because it

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
is the nickname given to
the flood gods of Egypt,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:84%
the shining ones,
followers of Horus,

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating how two
distinct cultures once shared

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:90%
a common point of origin.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Despite the impressive
temple culture of the Maya,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
their sacred rituals
begin elsewhere.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Yucatan is filled
with cenotes, created

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.540 align:middle line:84%
from the impact
of meteorites that

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:90%
took its rivers under ground.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Practically all pyramids
were built over a cenote,

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.610 align:middle line:84%
illustrating how the
womb of the feminine

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
supports the phallic
masculine temple above it.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Every teaching, every
ritual starts with ceremony

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.715 align:middle line:90%
inside the ritual cave.

00:11:24.715 --> 00:11:27.760 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
The Maya spatial model
was organized horizontally

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
by the cardinal directions,
representing the material

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:38.670 align:middle line:84%
world, and vertically by three
tiers, a creative underworld

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
housing the forces of creation,
a middle world represented

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
by the temple, and an
upper world, the sky.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
At the core is the
cosmic hearth, the Orion

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
constellation, so much so
that the symbol of Orion

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.595 align:middle line:84%
is even painted on the roof
of the ceremonial cave.

00:11:56.595 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:84%
The other world of the
Maya is called Xibalba.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of its most
important places of access

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.420 align:middle line:90%
is the sacred cave Balankanche.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this cave system was
chosen above 1,000 others

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:26.070 align:middle line:84%
because its layout so resembles
a uterus, one figuratively

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:90%
engages with a divine womb.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.310 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom of the
subterranean world

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.880 align:middle line:84%
lies a waterway representing
the River of Forgetfulness,

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.795 align:middle line:84%
the stream every initiate must
cross to reach the other world.

00:12:39.795 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.330 align:middle line:84%
In the main chamber, a
tall limestone column

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:84%
rises like the world tree
connecting the lower, middle,

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and upper worlds, the
umbilical cord that

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.800 align:middle line:84%
takes the soul on its journey
along the celestial river.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
This tree is Wacah Chan,
meaning "raised-up sky."

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Scattered among its roots lie
incense burners and containers

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:84%
for the narcotic
used by initiates

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:84%
to elicit a near-death
experience whereby the soul

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.755 align:middle line:90%
temporarily leaves the body.

00:13:18.755 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:84%
The traditional concoction
is called balché,

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:84%
a fermented honey drink brewed
inside a canoe hollowed from

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
a sacred tree, the vessel to
take the soul to the heart

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.670 align:middle line:90%
of the sky.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian tradition,
a similar celestial boat

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:84%
was used by its famous
initiate Osiris,

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:84%
the earthly
representative of Orion.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.880 align:middle line:84%
The ritual that took
place inside Balankanche

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:84%
is memorialized in
the local legend

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
of a boy who was forbidden
to marry his beloved.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So he ran away with
his intended bride

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and hid her in the cave,
hence the nickname Xtakumbil,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:90%
"the hidden lady."

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's a hidden
meaning to this story.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Every initiate who undertook
the journey to the other world,

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.810 align:middle line:84%
did so to discover the
source of wisdom, which

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:90%
was embodied in a divine woman.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:84%
If the initiate
returned successfully

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.835 align:middle line:84%
from this out-of-body journey,
they married the cosmic bride.

00:14:19.835 --> 00:14:27.350 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Even in a state of
ruin, the temple cities

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:84%
originally constructed by the
Itz and expanded by the Maya

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.450 align:middle line:90%
were beautiful.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Every building was encoded
with the vocabulary

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
of sacred knowledge
by people within

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
an unerring understanding
of universal laws,

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
producing a logical and
harmonious conceptualization

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:90%
And Uxmal is a perfect example.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.660 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Uxmal means "built three times."

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, the site as a whole
follows three distinct axes,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.260 align:middle line:84%
each defining a period
of thousands of years

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
before the stars
moved and new temples

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:90%
realigned to mirror the sky.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:84%
The original site is
described as an invisible city

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.640 align:middle line:84%
with the distinction of
having been built in one night

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.575 align:middle line:90%
by the magic of a dwarf king.

00:15:21.575 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:90%


00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:10%
Sacbes link Uxmal
with Chichen Itza

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:10%
on the other side of
Yucatan and hundreds

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:10%
of miles further with
Xunantunich in Belize and Tikal

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:10%
in Guatemala.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
One such road arrives at
the main quadrangle of Uxmal

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:46.330 align:middle line:84%
where it aligns with Venus
through an entrance arch.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
The arch defines a
type of activity taking

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:90%
place inside the courtyard.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:84%
With a pitch of 52 degrees,
the angle of the Great Pyramid

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:84%
of Giza, the buildings
lining the courtyard

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.150 align:middle line:84%
are concerned with the
transformation of the soul.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
This area once served
as a cosmic university

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:84%
where priestess
Ix Kukulkan, "she

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.970 align:middle line:84%
who teaches the path
of wisdom," transmitted

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
knowledge to astronomers,
architects, artists,

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and scribes, many of whom
traveled across Central America

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:84%
to receive the
knowledge of the gods.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:10%
There was a focus
on the application

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:10%
of integrative medicine,
so healers were also

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.065 align:middle line:10%
made their way here.

00:16:28.065 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.460 align:middle line:10%
At the center of
the courtyard once

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:10%
stood the hearth of
the temple complex

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:10%
where stood three
stones commemorating

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:10%
the belt stars of Orion in
honor of the original teachers.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:84%
X's marked the faces
of the buildings,

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:84%
defining them as
restricted spaces.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:84%
There are exactly 584
X's the cycle of Venus,

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.430 align:middle line:90%
the Maya symbol of rebirth.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.815 align:middle line:84%
It seems one came
here to be reborn.

00:16:58.815 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:84%
The lower building is called
Itzamna, the shaman house.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Its cardinal
position in the south

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:84%
defines it as a place
where the element of fire

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.800 align:middle line:84%
is lit within the
initiate so they

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:90%
come into their personal power.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Along the upper
molding are flowers

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:84%
called itz, the magic substance,
indicating a place where

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:84%
narcotics were studied and
probably ingested as part

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.185 align:middle line:90%
of the initiatory process.

00:17:28.185 --> 00:17:31.040 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Above each doorway,
a stone window

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:middle line:84%
complete with a
zoomorphic creature

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:84%
represents the
transformational cycle

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:90%
of birth, death, and rebirth.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.210 align:middle line:84%
This can only be possible when
the individual experiences

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:48.020 align:middle line:84%
the paradisial world
while they live.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, this name of
this window into another reality

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:10%
is Xanil nah, which is
uncannily similar to "Jannah,"

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:10%
the window into paradise
in Persian mysticism.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.680 align:middle line:84%
For the journey to be
accomplished successfully,

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:84%
the initiate must enter
in a balanced state.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So eight chambers
reflect the teachings

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:84%
of the four material and
four spiritual forces

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:84%
with the ninth, the
entrance defining

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:90%
the stage of completion.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:84%
In this building initiates
began and finished

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:90%
their inner journey.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.450 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Across the way is Nikte'il
Nah, the assembly house.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Located in the north, the
temple concerns itself

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:84%
with understanding the laws
of magnetism and gravity

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that allow the soul passage
through the field of reeds

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:84%
leading to Xibalba, hence
why a house of reeds

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:90%
appears above each room.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.000 align:middle line:84%
These are canna,
serpent houses, where

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.925 align:middle line:84%
one comes to work with a
serpentine flow of energy.

00:18:51.925 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:10%
11 chambers plus
two side chambers

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:10%
make 11 over 13, the
solar and lunar numbers,

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:10%
the mark of the
masculine and feminine

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:10%
intertwined in harmony.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:10%
Scrolls spreading across
the face of the building

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:10%
indicate clouds, emphasizing
the ascent to the sky.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But the prominent feature
is the mask of Chaac.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
The ring eyes of a young
person cover an old face.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.470 align:middle line:84%
The old ego comes
here to die to be

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:84%
reborn with a new and younger
way of looking at the world.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Members of the
Chaac society walk

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:84%
in the footsteps of the
divine lineage of the Kanuul.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
We're reminded of this in
the effigies of Itzamna

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:84%
who is depicted with his
breath extending from his mouth

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:84%
from which came the
knowledge taught here.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:84%
In the direction
of the rising sun,

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:84%
the east house is concerned
with healing and rebirth.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Epitomized by the
pentagram, the building

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.490 align:middle line:90%
comes with five chambers.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:10%
Its flowers identify the blessed
substance, the application

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:10.130 align:middle line:10%
of plant medicine which included
narcotics for shamanic travel.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.480 align:middle line:84%
The Itz magicians
themselves are depicted

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:84%
with their tongues
extended like the green man

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:84%
from whose breath nature is
periodically rejuvenated.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:84%
When the sun descends,
it marks the journey

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.970 align:middle line:90%
into the other world.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So in the west
house, one becomes

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.280 align:middle line:84%
fully aware of the
laws of nature,

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:84%
which in sacred
teachings are symbolized

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:84%
by the seven colors of light
and the seven notes of the music

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:90%
scale.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:84%
These laws were once taught in
each of these seven chambers.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Cloud and lattice motifs
indicate a cloud house,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.860 align:middle line:84%
a place from where one
travels to another reality

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully
returns transformed,

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:84%
like the initiate emerging
from the mouth of a snake.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Not only has he
been indoctrinated

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:84%
into the teachings of the
people of the serpent,

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:84%
he no longer associates
with the soil

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:84%
alone but rises like a bird
above the material world

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and sees the bigger picture.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:84%
The individual has become a
feathered serpent, the path

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:90%
once taken by Quetzalcoatl.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:23.910 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Across the way, a massive
artificial platform

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
rises above Uxmal and
supports a group of buildings.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:84%
The main one forms a huge
rectangle in the ratio

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:84%
eight to one, a triple
octave in music.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:45.780 align:middle line:84%
It is covered with no less
than 20,000 sculptures.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Images of the rain
god Chaac suggest

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:84%
this may have been erected when
the regional weather changed

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
radically to a dryer
climate around 2500 BC.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Each mask is assembled from
exactly 19 limestone blocks,

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:84%
reflecting the 18.6
year cycle when

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:09.110 align:middle line:84%
the lunar and solar
calendars synchronize.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Doorways conform to
the ratio of the octave

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:90%
and the golden ratio.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:10%
Above the central
chamber, a large emblem

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.790 align:middle line:10%
of a feathered Itzamna
is supported by seven Itz

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:24.400 align:middle line:10%
in the form of serpents.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in these
buildings is by chance.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Everything conveys a
piece of information,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.135 align:middle line:90%
like a book made of stone.

00:22:31.135 --> 00:22:33.740 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Two spear archers link the
building's three elements.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
The first is curiously angled
at 19.5 degrees, the angle

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.080 align:middle line:84%
of energy upwelling, reflecting
in the latitude where

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.690 align:middle line:84%
the most energetically active
spot manifests on a planet.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, it is
Mauna Kea volcano.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
The other spear door is
angled at 33 degrees.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:10%
It reflects the
most secret teaching

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.740 align:middle line:10%
of the mysteries, the conscious
manipulation of gravity,

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:10%
which on Earth brings materials
to rest at the angle of 32.72

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:10%
degrees, or 33 for convenience.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:90%


00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Even sculptures are functional.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:84%
In the adjacent
courtyard, a dual jaguar

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:84%
is aligned to the
central door to mark

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.930 align:middle line:84%
the sudden rising of Venus
over hills three miles away.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:90%
But there's more to it.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Such sculptures were cut from
magnetically charged stone

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and induce specific effects.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Here, a person
facing one jaguar is

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:84%
able to transmit
a thought or image

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:44.400 align:middle line:90%
to a person facing the other.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.280 align:middle line:84%
How life appeared on earth
and who taught it to humans

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:84%
was a focus of the
House of Turtles,

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:84%
so-called because
of a line of turtles

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.810 align:middle line:90%
crawling around its perimeter.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:10%
In Maya cosmology,
Orion is a cosmic turtle

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.810 align:middle line:10%
whose back was cracked
by lightning, allowing

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.540 align:middle line:10%
the god of maize to
rise through the crack

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:10%
and fertilize the Earth.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.070 align:middle line:84%
From the House of Turtles
the Pyramid of the Magician

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:19.240 align:middle line:90%
rises above the canopy of trees.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It's an elegant structure,
conceding a long, long history.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.680 align:middle line:10%
Like all temples, it
has grown organically

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:10%
to reflect the ages and
the movement of the sky

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:10%
across long periods of time.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.855 align:middle line:10%
The present building
incorporates four older

00:24:34.855 --> 00:24:35.655 align:middle line:10%
temples.

00:24:35.655 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.050 align:middle line:84%
At a foot of its western face
is a restricted courtyard

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:45.770 align:middle line:84%
that once saw its
share of ceremonies.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:84%
The phallic stone pillar
marks the crossing

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.980 align:middle line:90%
of telluric currents.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It is the spot where offerings
and prayers were made

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and where one prepared mentally
before approaching the pyramid.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.740 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Effigies of Chaac line
the steep staircase.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.420 align:middle line:84%
They lead to a room into which
the light of the descending

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:84%
equinox sun is swallowed by the
massive mouth of the pyramid's

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:90%
protective monster.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:18.600 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:84%
By contrast, the
eastern side is covered

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:84%
by a wide staircase leading
to the portal of an older

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Like a womb, it received the
light of the rising equinox

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.460 align:middle line:84%
sun, now slightly offset
due to the gradual movement

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:90%
of the sky.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:84%
The correct alignment
took place in 7000 BC.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.850 align:middle line:84%
The equinox sun is a highly
celebrated time of year,

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:84%
since it marks the moment
when light and dark are

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
in perfect equilibrium,
thus it reflects the ideal

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.340 align:middle line:90%
of a balanced society.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:84%
This ideal was not only marked
by pyramids and temples,

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.510 align:middle line:84%
it was also calculated to
influence the entire Yucatan

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Peninsula.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.010 align:middle line:84%
On the east coast,
the Temple of Tulum

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
marks the entry point of
the rising equinox sun.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:90%


00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.745 align:middle line:84%
Its setting on the west coast is
marked on the island of Jaina.

00:26:14.745 --> 00:26:18.260 align:middle line:90%


00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.960 align:middle line:84%
The island represents
the descent into Xibalba,

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:84%
so not surprisingly,
over 20,000 Maya

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:84%
came to be buried here along
with their totem figurines.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:33.920 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally, ajain is a
Persian term for a spirit

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and it defines Jainism,
one of the most

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:84%
ancient religious
traditions of India

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.780 align:middle line:84%
which teaches a path
to spiritual purity

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and enlightenment through
nonviolence, ethics that

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:50.420 align:middle line:84%
are oddly identical
to those introduced

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
in Yucatan by Itzamna
over 11,000 years ago.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Were all these people borrowing
from the same instruction

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.601 align:middle line:90%
manual?

00:27:01.601 --> 00:27:04.523 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:04.523 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.990 align:middle line:84%
The central aim of the teachings
of Itzamna and Quetzalcoatl

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:26.400 align:middle line:84%
sought nothing less than
spiritual transfiguration.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.800 align:middle line:10%
This was achieved
through mental tests

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.770 align:middle line:10%
and an aesthetic lifestyle
aimed at removing oneself

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:10%
from physical attachments,
a flaying of the self,

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:10%
so to speak, so that
this precious stone

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.530 align:middle line:10%
and rich feather, as the
Maya refer to the soul,

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.795 align:middle line:10%
could access a finer
level of being.

00:27:42.795 --> 00:27:46.720 align:middle line:90%


00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.520 align:middle line:84%
The process required
the initiative

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:84%
to undergo a symbolic
death and rebirth,

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.560 align:middle line:84%
just as Quetzalcoatl
and Kukulkan once

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.310 align:middle line:84%
did for four days inside a
stone box, after which they

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:84%
arose and appeared as bright
as the morning star Venus.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:90%


00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.590 align:middle line:84%
The Maya associated
spiritual teachings

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:90%
with three stellar objects--

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.720 align:middle line:90%
Sirius, Orion, and Pleiades.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:84%
They refer to them as
suns, which brings us

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:84%
to the temple
complex of Oxkintok

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.140 align:middle line:84%
meaning "where the
three suns burn."

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Its most inconspicuous yet most
important building is Satunsat.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Writing about it, a
visiting Spanish priest

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.610 align:middle line:90%
misunderstood its purpose.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
The quote-- "It is
a place where they

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.090 align:middle line:84%
tossed those who committed
great offenses so there

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.320 align:middle line:90%
they may die."

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:84%
He believed this to be
a jail when, in fact, it

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:90%
is a labyrinth.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:52.410 align:middle line:84%
The entrance marks the equinox
sunset, the entry into Xibalba.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.500 align:middle line:84%
A low ceiling forces a
person to bend in humility

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.870 align:middle line:90%
and into a dark maze.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Turning left takes
you to a dead end.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Turning right also takes you to
a wall, but with a difference.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.220 align:middle line:84%
The ceiling slab
pivots, allowing entry

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.520 align:middle line:90%
into a second level.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:84%
The process is repeated into a
third and progressively taller

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.750 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Walking the maze simulates
the disoriented soul

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:20.880 align:middle line:84%
in the other world
which one can only

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:26.240 align:middle line:84%
navigate by using the intuitive
or right side of the brain.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Upon ascending the three
levels, the initiate

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:84%
finally reappears to face
Venus at the equinox sunrise.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:84%
In the world of Maya,
there is physical death

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.785 align:middle line:84%
and there's metaphoric
death, a concept clearly lost

00:29:40.785 --> 00:29:41.585 align:middle line:90%
on that priest.

00:29:41.585 --> 00:29:45.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.780 align:middle line:84%
A sacbe from the
temple city of Tikal

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.275 align:middle line:84%
takes you to Labna, a
journey of 200 miles.

00:29:51.275 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:56.420 align:middle line:84%
A visitor in 1840
would have been

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:84%
greeted by the
ruined observatory

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.580 align:middle line:84%
on its artificial hill that
featured a monolithic statue

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.755 align:middle line:90%
of Itzamna's consort Ix Chel.

00:30:03.755 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:84%
There's an Asian feel
to the architecture

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.350 align:middle line:84%
here, as though one is
in a Cambodian temple.

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And indeed there was
much cultural exchange

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:17.525 align:middle line:84%
between Asian
cultures and the Maya.

00:30:17.525 --> 00:30:20.200 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:84%
The entrance arch marks
the end of the second sacbe

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and commemorates
the original site

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.210 align:middle line:84%
which aligns to the
rising of Sirius

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:33.220 align:middle line:84%
on the winter
solstice in 6000 BC.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Inside the courtyard,
two xanil nah

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:41.530 align:middle line:84%
define this as another place
of access into Xibalba.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.960 align:middle line:84%
The beehive-shaped
arch indicates

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.290 align:middle line:84%
one came here to collect
the metaphoric honey,

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:51.160 align:middle line:84%
the very knowledge of the gods,
which is why deities are always

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.260 align:middle line:90%
associated with this substance.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.130 align:middle line:90%


00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:84%
A close look at the foundations
of Labna's sacred buildings

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:04.560 align:middle line:84%
reveal images of [NON-ENGLISH],,
nature gods whose purpose is

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.870 align:middle line:84%
to provide protection
to sacred abodes.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Protruding from one temple, the
sculpture of a risen Kukulkan

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.340 align:middle line:84%
emerges from the
mouth of a serpent.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:22.150 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.460 align:middle line:84%
An arch at the
temple city of Kabah

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:28.570 align:middle line:84%
marks the arrival of a royal
road from the arch at Uxmal,

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:34.420 align:middle line:84%
11.060606 miles away,
the exact numerical value

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.170 align:middle line:90%
of the sunspot cycle in years.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.570 align:middle line:84%
In one corner of the
complex, a pyramid

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.670 align:middle line:90%
still awaits excavation.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.580 align:middle line:10%
Kabah is an odd word
in Yucatan because it

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.060 align:middle line:10%
is the name of the Egyptian
esoteric soul body teaching

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.720 align:middle line:10%
Kaaba, better known by
its full title Kabbalah.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.280 align:middle line:90%


00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.520 align:middle line:84%
As a complex, Kabah
represents the strong hand

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:84%
of the creator, Ahau, the
nickname of the Egyptian sages.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:07.695 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, Egyptian and Maya
languages share many words.

00:32:07.695 --> 00:32:11.180 align:middle line:90%


00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.750 align:middle line:10%
The central feature is
the temple Codz Poop,

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.170 align:middle line:10%
whose walls calculate
2,000 years of conjunction

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:21.070 align:middle line:10%
cycles between Earth and Venus.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Venus was central
to Maya cosmology

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:25.300 align:middle line:84%
because it was a
transitional marker

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.690 align:middle line:90%
from one age to the next.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.130 align:middle line:84%
It also calculates a 260
day calendar or nine cycles

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:36.070 align:middle line:84%
of the moon, the celestial
body that regulates

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:90%
the human gestation cycle.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Each day is represented by a
mask of the rain god Chaac.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Nearby, two Itz magicians
watch over the site

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:90%
like protective sentinels.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Probably the best known
Maya text is to Popol Vuh.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.680 align:middle line:84%
It tells how four
prophets and their wives

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.810 align:middle line:84%
descended from the
Pleiades to share

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:03.580 align:middle line:84%
the mysteries of
hidden knowledge

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.000 align:middle line:84%
at the temple
complex of Ek Balam.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:90%
The name means "jaguar star."

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.110 align:middle line:90%


00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Like so many temple
complexes, Ek Balam

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.600 align:middle line:84%
has been rebuilt and expanded
over a long period of time--

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:84%
a nucleus comprising
twin temples,

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.330 align:middle line:84%
an observational tower,
and a small ball court

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:29.770 align:middle line:84%
form a newer group
dated to 1300 BC,

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.800 align:middle line:84%
while a huge platform
featuring larger masonry

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.025 align:middle line:84%
sits on the site commemorating
a far more distant era.

00:33:36.025 --> 00:33:39.460 align:middle line:90%


00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.580 align:middle line:84%
An entrance arch on a
platform designed according

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:45.130 align:middle line:84%
to the golden ratio
marks the crossing

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.605 align:middle line:84%
of two sacbe along
cardinal points.

00:33:47.605 --> 00:33:50.450 align:middle line:90%


00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:84%
The remains of
sweat lodges testify

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:84%
to shamanic work
that took place here,

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.350 align:middle line:84%
possibly in
preparation to access

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.370 align:middle line:90%
the most prominent structure.

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:04.060 align:middle line:84%
100 foot high, this series
of rectangular platforms

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.600 align:middle line:90%
form a kind of step pyramid.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.780 align:middle line:10%
One by one, its chambers
are being excavated,

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:10%
revealing a litany
of stucco figures

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:10%
and over 40 sacred texts in
a good state of preservation.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the rooms is still
electromagnetically active

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and shuts down electrical
devices whenever

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.350 align:middle line:90%
they pass beyond its threshold.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:29.989 align:middle line:84%
The imposing staircase and
exterior of the building

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:32.810 align:middle line:84%
are juxtaposed at different
angles to the structure

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:36.620 align:middle line:84%
beneath demonstrating how
the sky changed by the time

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.199 align:middle line:84%
the new ruler
remodeled the site,

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:43.670 align:middle line:84%
as he describes on a stela
at the base of the building.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:49.250 align:middle line:84%
The double serpent identifies
his Kanuul heritage.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid-type
buildings represents

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.920 align:middle line:84%
witz, the sacred mound upon
which the knowledge of the gods

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.260 align:middle line:90%
was originally deposited.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Here, the most elaborate
chamber is the Jaguar Room.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.740 align:middle line:84%
It is shaped like
the mouth of a witz

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.580 align:middle line:84%
monster, the protective beast
of the sacred mountain whose

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:11.870 align:middle line:84%
33 teeth serve to metaphorically
deflesh the initiate

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:15.110 align:middle line:84%
so as to lighten the physical
body before undertaking

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.505 align:middle line:90%
the journey into Xibalba.

00:35:16.505 --> 00:35:19.800 align:middle line:90%


00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Seven Itz teachers hover
around the entrance,

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.480 align:middle line:84%
some depicted with symbolic
wings, the teachers of the sky.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:34.280 align:middle line:84%
They are referred to as
angel, a being of creation.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.990 align:middle line:84%
One Itz is shown with fingers
in an Indian mudra position.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:42.500 align:middle line:84%
One sits in a yoga pose,
while another demonstrates

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:46.505 align:middle line:84%
the jaguar grip, the jaguar
being the guide into Xibalba.

00:35:46.505 --> 00:35:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:53.510 align:middle line:84%
The images around the
entrance depict the sky world,

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:57.320 align:middle line:84%
the chamber is the middle
world, and below the platform

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.930 align:middle line:84%
the lower world, with
its rivers and currents

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:04.250 align:middle line:84%
of creation and its
protective nature spirits.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Adjacent to the chamber
is the reading room.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Above the entrance, a reed
house in the shape of a T

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:84%
represents tau,
the breath of God

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.820 align:middle line:84%
from where the most
profound knowledge emerges,

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:84%
leaving little doubt as
to the kind of material

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:22.480 align:middle line:90%
that was read in this chamber.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Such visual clues
identify this area

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.250 align:middle line:84%
where the candidate
was taught the deeper

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.650 align:middle line:84%
mysteries, after
which they undertook

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:32.670 align:middle line:84%
an out-of-body journey to
gain firsthand experience.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Ek Balam was
clearly a site where

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.780 align:middle line:84%
restricted knowledge about the
forces of nature was conveyed,

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.450 align:middle line:84%
information that in the
wrong hands could be used

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:46.220 align:middle line:90%
and misused.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.550 align:middle line:84%
No wonder the Maya carefully
concealed the site with rubble

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:middle line:84%
until it resembled
a natural hill,

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.190 align:middle line:84%
fooling the invading Spanish
who simply walked past,

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:90%
oblivious to its importance.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:02.950 align:middle line:90%


00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:06.070 align:middle line:84%
In its heyday, the
ancient city of Mayapan

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:09.670 align:middle line:84%
was the place that united the
wisdom teachings of other sites

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:12.180 align:middle line:90%
throughout the Yucatan.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Itzamna's counterpart
Kukulkan once

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.610 align:middle line:84%
lived here, teaching the
structure of the cosmos

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and the art of uniting the
three forces of creation.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Like every other
flood god, he too

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.970 align:middle line:84%
was supported by seven
sages, one of whom

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:28.620 align:middle line:90%
was his wife and sister.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.280 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.470 align:middle line:84%
It's often been debated
how the Maya were

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:36.020 align:middle line:84%
able to maintain a
population large enough

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.880 align:middle line:84%
to build and
maintain the largest

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.850 align:middle line:90%
civilization in the Americas.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.730 align:middle line:84%
The answer is they designed
their step pyramids

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:84%
in such a way as to
allow electromagnetism

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:51.680 align:middle line:84%
to rise to the top platform
upon which seeds were placed.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.540 align:middle line:84%
The buildup of
electrical current

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:57.740 align:middle line:84%
fertilized the seeds, allowing
for as many as five harvests

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.460 align:middle line:90%
during the growing season.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:84%
One of these telluric currents
is still active today.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.370 align:middle line:84%
It flows along the
row of stone pillars

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:10.420 align:middle line:90%
before impregnating the pyramid.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.730 align:middle line:84%
There is also an
obligatory observatory

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:16.630 align:middle line:84%
where complex Maya calendars
were studied and implemented.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.910 align:middle line:84%
There was a long count
calendar spanning

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:25.720 align:middle line:84%
26,000 years and the Great
Cycle spanning 2,160 years.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Others tracked the motions of
Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter,

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.720 align:middle line:90%
along with eclipse cycles.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.980 align:middle line:84%
There was a 266-day
female gestation calendar,

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:84%
a general 365-day
solar calendar,

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:45.640 align:middle line:84%
a supplemental 819-day count,
and a 584-day Venus transit

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.480 align:middle line:84%
that calibrates with
the earth and sun.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Such calculations could
only be the product

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.250 align:middle line:84%
of a culture that
observed, calculated,

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and marked these transits over
tens of thousands of years.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.220 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the calendars were

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.980 align:middle line:84%
inherited from an
earlier civilization

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.215 align:middle line:90%
and expanded upon by the Maya.

00:39:05.215 --> 00:39:19.040 align:middle line:90%


00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.560 align:middle line:84%
At the entrance to the
town of Chichen Itza,

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.530 align:middle line:84%
an old church sits on the
site of a pyramid in which

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.780 align:middle line:84%
was found a 10-foot-tall
human skeleton,

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.720 align:middle line:84%
a good omen for the cultural
roots of this enormous temple

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.520 align:middle line:90%
city.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.950 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:90%


00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Over 2,000 temples and pyramids
interpret the universe,

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.150 align:middle line:84%
acting as focal points for human
interaction with the divine.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:55.550 align:middle line:90%


00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:58.430 align:middle line:84%
It is a cosmic university
to which candidates flocked

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:02.060 align:middle line:84%
from all over Central America
to be educated to the highest

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:06.900 align:middle line:84%
levels of mathematics,
astrology, astronomy, science,

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.170 align:middle line:90%
philosophy, and the mysteries.

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Each discipline shared in
the individual temples which

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.470 align:middle line:84%
embody the teachings by
mere virtue of measures

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and decorations hardwired into
the fabric of the buildings.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:90%


00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Chichen Itza means "mouth or
well of the water wizard."

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.660 align:middle line:84%
As the name implies,
it was founded

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.790 align:middle line:90%
by Itzamna and his crew.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And ever since, people
have been coming here

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.660 align:middle line:90%
in search of enlightenment.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.080 align:middle line:90%


00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Its supplemental
title Uucyabnal,

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:45.770 align:middle line:84%
the seven great house, honors
the seven Itz as well as

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:49.130 align:middle line:84%
the star cluster most
associated with great teachers,

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.590 align:middle line:90%
the Pleiades.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:53.840 align:middle line:84%
On the summit of the
Temple of the Tables,

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.770 align:middle line:84%
there once stood a series of
altars supported by 19 figures

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:02.150 align:middle line:84%
called atlantes, a reminder from
where the knowledge originated.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.720 align:middle line:90%


00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.900 align:middle line:84%
One building features an
elaborate mask representing

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Itzamna and his divine breath.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Beehives mark this
restricted abode

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:17.110 align:middle line:84%
as a place where symbolic
honey was dispensed to adepts.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:22.360 align:middle line:90%


00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.510 align:middle line:84%
The adjacent building
is a mask in itself,

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:29.710 align:middle line:84%
covered with images of
Itzamna and of Choc,

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:33.380 align:middle line:84%
the old face overlaid with
a young person's eyes,

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:38.670 align:middle line:84%
indicating teachings that
focused on personal renewal.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.760 align:middle line:10%
Above the entrance, a
man seated in meditation

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.950 align:middle line:10%
is clothed below
the waist and naked

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:47.430 align:middle line:10%
above because in the lower
world, things are hidden,

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:51.930 align:middle line:10%
whereas in the world above,
everything is laid bare.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.510 align:middle line:84%
He is a resurrected
hero originally painted

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:58.150 align:middle line:84%
blue just like other
rejuvenating heroes Shiva

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:90%
and Osiris.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:06.250 align:middle line:90%


00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.440 align:middle line:84%
At Chichen Itza,
the understanding

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.830 align:middle line:84%
of the sky and a person's place
in the cosmic scheme of things

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.850 align:middle line:90%
was paramount.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:17.190 align:middle line:84%
A large observatory
with a spiral staircase

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:21.120 align:middle line:84%
stands on a platform
in the ratio 4 to 3,

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.410 align:middle line:84%
the orbital proportion
between Earth and Venus.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:27.360 align:middle line:10%
The round structure
is oddly placed

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.120 align:middle line:10%
on the platform, suggesting
a later adaptation

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.650 align:middle line:10%
to a constantly changing sky.

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:10%


00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:10%
The corners aligned to solstices
and carefully placed windows

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.670 align:middle line:10%
marked astronomical events.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:42.930 align:middle line:90%


00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:47.760 align:middle line:84%
The cycles of the moon, Venus,
Sirius, Orion, and Pleiades

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.020 align:middle line:90%
were calculated here.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:54.610 align:middle line:90%


00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.950 align:middle line:10%
One of the main
functions of Chichen Itza

00:42:56.950 --> 00:43:00.040 align:middle line:10%
involves the Rite of
Initiation and it took place

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.615 align:middle line:10%
at three interconnected sites.

00:43:01.615 --> 00:43:04.170 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:07.380 align:middle line:84%
The first is a temple of
the jaguar, a small room

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.750 align:middle line:90%
by the main ball court.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.600 align:middle line:84%
It is presided by an
eroded image of Itzamna

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:18.480 align:middle line:84%
as a wizened old man with
Caucasian features and a beard.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Protected by a feather
serpent on each column,

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:26.170 align:middle line:84%
the room is in the proportion
of the golden ratio.

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:29.590 align:middle line:10%
A weathered panel depicts a
ceremonial dance once enacted

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:32.080 align:middle line:10%
over five days around
November the first

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.110 align:middle line:10%
presided by an Itz
magician who works the life

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:39.770 align:middle line:10%
force while a group of
participants walks behind him.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:41.900 align:middle line:84%
A panel depicts a
kind of battle scene

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.570 align:middle line:84%
where the soul overcomes
the physical world,

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:47.780 align:middle line:84%
while mountains and
crevices emit the life force

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:52.550 align:middle line:84%
in the form of serpents who
support the nature gods.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:54.920 align:middle line:10%
The feathered serpent
serves the entourage

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.340 align:middle line:10%
and protects a magician holding
a mirror that enables him

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.360 align:middle line:10%
to see into the other world.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:12.810 align:middle line:84%
The chamber is aligned to the
winter solstice in 5500 BC.

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Having been advised on
the mysteries of life,

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:18.540 align:middle line:84%
the individual was then
led to the second location,

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.650 align:middle line:84%
a small pyramid that few
take much interest in.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Built over a cenote, it is
constructed with seven tiers,

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.160 align:middle line:84%
marking it as a
place where one comes

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:34.090 align:middle line:84%
to interact with the
formative laws of nature.

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Stairways decorated with
intertwined serpents

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.490 align:middle line:84%
representing electrical and
magnetic currents feature

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:43.400 align:middle line:84%
eyes inside each
coil, a reminder that

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.220 align:middle line:84%
harnessing these forces
allows one to peer

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.825 align:middle line:90%
into other levels of reality.

00:44:47.825 --> 00:44:51.240 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Once prepared, the
individual entered

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.090 align:middle line:84%
from the cave underneath, made
their way into the pyramid

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.910 align:middle line:84%
by way of an umbilical
shaft, and spent

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:middle line:84%
a few days inside the
womb-like environment.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.660 align:middle line:10%
Upon returning
from their journey,

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.840 align:middle line:10%
they climbed up another shaft
to reappear on the summit.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:13.090 align:middle line:90%


00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:15.310 align:middle line:84%
To complete the
initiation, the initiate

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:17.710 align:middle line:84%
would be taken to
the third location

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:20.230 align:middle line:84%
opposite the first
temple of the jaguar.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:24.520 align:middle line:10%
A large step mound called
Temple of the Warriors.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.470 align:middle line:84%
At the top of the
grand staircase,

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.650 align:middle line:84%
they would gaze at the
seated figure of Chac Mool

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:33.820 align:middle line:84%
at the same moment Venus rose
before the equinox sunrise

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.295 align:middle line:84%
and appeared above the
plate on his belly.

00:45:36.295 --> 00:45:38.840 align:middle line:90%


00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Together, the three
sites form a triptych

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.760 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a perfect
right angled triangle.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:49.330 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Historians have led us to
believe that a gruesome blood

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.390 align:middle line:84%
sport was conducted
in Maya ball courts--

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:57.850 align:middle line:90%
or was it?

00:45:57.850 --> 00:45:59.950 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, the
playing area is

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.010 align:middle line:84%
composed of two inverted
Ts, representing

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Tau, the breath of God.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.920 align:middle line:10%
And access is via a
staircase whose balustrades

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.700 align:middle line:10%
are carved with wacah chan, the
world tree linking the three

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:17.150 align:middle line:10%
levels of reality, upon which
is perched the bird Itzam Yeh,

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:20.620 align:middle line:10%
representing the elevated soul.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And if the arena was meant for
a public sporting activity,

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:28.120 align:middle line:84%
there is a remarkable absence
of seating for spectators.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, a better
explanation is in order.

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:35.190 align:middle line:10%
The steep walls of the court
illustrate Maya cosmology

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:39.240 align:middle line:10%
of how life emerged from a crack
in the mouth of creation, hence

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:44.400 align:middle line:10%
why the ball court is
referred to as hom, a crevice.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.850 align:middle line:84%
The court itself is
acoustically tuned.

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:57.420 align:middle line:84%
A vocal sound or a clap of hands
echoes exactly seven times,

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.750 align:middle line:84%
an homage to sound as a
causative element in creation.

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:03.490 align:middle line:90%


00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:05.920 align:middle line:10%
High up on the inner
walls, stone rings

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.190 align:middle line:10%
are carved with intertwined
feathered serpents.

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Eyes fill the gaps
between the coils so

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that when the ball
penetrated the ring,

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.620 align:middle line:84%
it became the object with
which to see into Xibalba,

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.680 align:middle line:84%
hence the nickname by which
the ball court was known

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Tlach-tli, the looking place.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So far it seems the
purpose of the game

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:31.650 align:middle line:84%
was one of instructive
or spiritual value.

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But the most telling clues are
the intricately carved panels

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:38.970 align:middle line:84%
running the length of the court
in which players are depicted

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:41.670 align:middle line:90%
in a most unusual game.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:45.660 align:middle line:84%
The central player has no head
and seven wriggling snakes

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.390 align:middle line:90%
rise out of his severed neck.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Each represent a
law of creation.

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:53.400 align:middle line:10%
But to embody this
knowledge, the player

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:58.020 align:middle line:10%
must first decapitate his ego,
depicted at the player's feet

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.410 align:middle line:10%
as a large skull inside a halo.

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:05.310 align:middle line:90%
It is called way, the soul.

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:07.440 align:middle line:10%
Altogether, this
portion of the panel

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.760 align:middle line:10%
depicts an initiate on his path
to wisdom supported either side

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.400 align:middle line:10%
by the seven sages.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.460 align:middle line:10%
The entire scene depicts
a cylindrical projection

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:21.120 align:middle line:10%
of the planes around the Zodiac,
tracing a path of planets

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.940 align:middle line:10%
above and below the
celestial horizon.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.280 align:middle line:10%
In other words, the
game played here

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:30.250 align:middle line:10%
was a figurative ball
game of the gods.

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:32.650 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the game was
to amass enough points

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:37.330 align:middle line:84%
to reach the center of
the field, teocalli.

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:39.910 align:middle line:84%
The aim was for players
to learn and interact

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:41.620 align:middle line:84%
with the laws of
nature and learn

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.570 align:middle line:90%
the greatest game of all--

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.270 align:middle line:90%
the game of life.

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:49.210 align:middle line:84%
The ball game was a metaphor
of the regenerative cycle

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:50.320 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And the person who
understood its mechanics

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.570 align:middle line:84%
overcame the repetitive
cycle of fate.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Thus it was a game
of symbolic warfare.

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:02.020 align:middle line:84%
All in all, the ball
court enabled people

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.290 align:middle line:84%
to visualize the mechanics
of a spiritual drama

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:07.000 align:middle line:90%
and how to embody them.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And it is encapsulated in
the upper temple overlooking

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:14.770 align:middle line:84%
the court where a large mural
depicts a metaphoric scene--

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:17.950 align:middle line:84%
the battle between the laws
of nature and the incarnated

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:20.760 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Like all things, the loss of
the original meaning over time

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:26.460 align:middle line:84%
led to misunderstanding
and the game

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.430 align:middle line:84%
degenerated into a literal
game of life and death

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:33.090 align:middle line:84%
in northern Mexico, which
the Aztec reenacted each year

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:35.676 align:middle line:90%
with gruesome barbarity.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.210 align:middle line:84%
The dominant feature
of Chichen Itza

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:50.150 align:middle line:84%
is undoubtedly the
pyramid of Kukulkan

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:53.090 align:middle line:84%
a masterpiece of
geodetic, numeric,

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:56.400 align:middle line:90%
and astronomical information.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The floor of the plaza from
which it rises was once painted

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:03.150 align:middle line:84%
in red cinnabar and forms the
top of several underground

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:06.300 align:middle line:84%
levels, built by the
original astronomer priest

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.500 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.440 align:middle line:84%
There may be as many as
nine underground levels

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:16.620 align:middle line:90%
to reflect the Maya underworld.

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.990 align:middle line:84%
All of this, too, was
built above a cenote

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and originally accessed
by canoe using a network

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.940 align:middle line:90%
of underground waterways.

The pyramids general
slope of 52 degrees

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:32.870 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the
Great Pyramid of Giza.

Its terrace walls
slanted 72 degrees,

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:38.900 align:middle line:84%
the route number to calculate
the earth's procession

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.720 align:middle line:90%
and the houses of the Zodiac.

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Each large step
features 52 panels,

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:51.210 align:middle line:84%
the cycle of the Pleiades,
which equals one Maya century.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Stairways inclined at
45 degrees represent

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:57.480 align:middle line:90%
the square, the material world.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And four staircases
of 91 steps equal 364,

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:08.120 align:middle line:84%
with the top platform
making 365, the solar year.

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.750 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid's shape tracks
the equinoxes, solstices,

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:15.350 align:middle line:90%
and the zenith of the sun.

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:18.170 align:middle line:84%
At the equinox sunrise,
the pyramid's shadow

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:22.320 align:middle line:84%
forms the head and wings of
a quetzal bird on the ground,

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.010 align:middle line:84%
while the clap of hands
imitates the bird's sound.

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:33.350 align:middle line:84%
At sunset, the
light casts shadows

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:37.070 align:middle line:84%
in seven isosceles triangles
against the Western balustrade

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:39.330 align:middle line:90%
that evoke a wriggling serpent.

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And by contrast, the
winter solstice sunset

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:46.705 align:middle line:84%
projects a serpent descending
into and fertilizing the earth.

00:51:46.705 --> 00:51:50.990 align:middle line:90%


00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Strategically situated
on the seventh course,

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:56.210 align:middle line:84%
the inner chamber of
the pyramid is referred

00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:59.060 align:middle line:90%
to as the Chamber of Alchemy.

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Painted in red cinnabar and
decorated with 72 jade spots,

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:07.430 align:middle line:84%
the jaguar throne represents the
bridge between the two worlds.

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:10.280 align:middle line:84%
In an induced catatonic
state, the initiate

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:15.110 align:middle line:84%
would leave the body and enter
the dwelling place of the gods.

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:17.900 align:middle line:84%
The ideal of the Maya was
the overcoming of gravity

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:20.060 align:middle line:90%
and the ascent of the soul.

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.210 align:middle line:84%
The more an individual worked
with the concepts embodied

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:26.900 align:middle line:84%
in this building, the more they
became aligned to cosmic order

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and the more likely they return
transformed and enlightened

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:34.810 align:middle line:90%
as an Aku, an illuminated one.

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:37.780 align:middle line:84%
The risen initiate was then
draped with a leopard skin,

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:41.770 align:middle line:84%
just as in ancient Egypt, where
Osiris himself was depicted

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:44.080 align:middle line:84%
as a crouching
leopard, and the priest

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.185 align:middle line:84%
of Amenti who served his
ideals wore leopard skin.

00:52:47.185 --> 00:52:54.780 align:middle line:90%


00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.750 align:middle line:84%
According to the Maya, the
temple tradition of Yucatan

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:00.570 align:middle line:84%
is a continuation
of Atitlan in what

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:03.900 align:middle line:84%
is described as the
rebuilding of the former world

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.750 align:middle line:90%
of the gods.

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Just how old the
lineage of the Itz

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.240 align:middle line:84%
might have been is revealed in
the Maya serpent dynasty that

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.600 align:middle line:84%
covers 16,000 years
and most likely

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.510 align:middle line:84%
originated in Atitlan
until a catastrophe

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.945 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the Ice Age forced
them to resettle in Yucatan.

00:53:20.945 --> 00:53:25.170 align:middle line:90%


00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happened to these
sages of whom the Maya wrote

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:30.720 align:middle line:90%
were endowed with intelligence?

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.750 align:middle line:84%
They saw and instantly
they could see far.

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:37.450 align:middle line:84%
They succeeded in knowing all
that there is in the world.

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:39.390 align:middle line:84%
The things hidden
in the distance

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:42.390 align:middle line:84%
they saw without
first having to move.

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Great was their wisdom.

00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Their sight reached to the
forests, the rocks, the lakes,

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:51.870 align:middle line:84%
the seas, the mountains
and the valleys.

00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:54.060 align:middle line:84%
In truth, they
were admirable men.

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:55.800 align:middle line:90%
They were able to know all.

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And they examined
the four corners,

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:00.900 align:middle line:84%
the four points of
the arch of the sky,

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.910 align:middle line:90%
and the round face of the Earth.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:06.060 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Under various names,
the Itz migrated

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:11.700 align:middle line:84%
into the interior and the
highlands of Guatemala,

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:15.210 align:middle line:84%
settling on an island in a lake
named after their sunken island

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:17.670 align:middle line:90%
home, Atitlan.

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Here, they built a city
called Utatlan, a replica

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.730 align:middle line:90%
of the one they'd lost.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, the
island also sank,

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:29.670 align:middle line:84%
leaving the Itz to rebuild
Utatlan on the lake shore.

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:37.070 align:middle line:90%


00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Another of their island cities--

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Nojpeten, on the lake that still
bears their name Peten Itza.

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Here, the Itz erected
no less than 21 temples

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.300 align:middle line:90%
and a nine-step pyramid.

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.430 align:middle line:84%
There's no trace of
the buildings today,

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:54.170 align:middle line:84%
all destroyed by
the Spanish, who

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:56.960 align:middle line:84%
used the temples as a
quarry for their own homes,

00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:01.220 align:middle line:90%
then renamed the island Flores.

the Itz first landed

establish one of the greatest

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Maya tradition speaks of
rituals conducted here

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:50.110 align:middle line:84%
that allowed initiates to
travel through time and space

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and return with
specialized information.

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:58.450 align:middle line:84%
They were referred to as
Architects of the Sky.

00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Versed in the
mysteries, teachers

00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:04.720 align:middle line:84%
such as Itzamnaaj Balam
II and Lady Sak B'iyaan

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.760 align:middle line:90%
journeyed to parallel universes.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And the knowledge they
gained there was recorded

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:10.765 align:middle line:90%
on lintels throughout the site.

00:56:10.765 --> 00:56:29.720 align:middle line:90%


00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.600 align:middle line:84%
One complex slowly being
rescued from the jungle

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.170 align:middle line:84%
is Baak, the House of
the Infinite Serpent,

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:39.890 align:middle line:84%
a Maya ceremonial center
filled with sacred architecture

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and possessing one of the
highest spiritual frequencies.

00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:45.110 align:middle line:90%
It was later named Palenque.

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.660 align:middle line:90%


00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:50.910 align:middle line:84%
The figures responsible
for its renaissance

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:53.790 align:middle line:84%
in the seventh century were
the ruler K'inich Pacal

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:56.010 align:middle line:90%
and his priestesses.

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:59.550 align:middle line:10%
Their ancient teachings taught
the path to self-realization

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:02.520 align:middle line:10%
that led to the highest
grade of Maya master--

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:07.470 align:middle line:10%
Iq, "the breath of the
gods, the breath of life."

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Graphically, it took
the form of a T,

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:13.110 align:middle line:84%
the cross to which high
initiate have been symbolically

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:16.000 align:middle line:84%
attached to throughout
history, long,

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.240 align:middle line:84%
long before the advent
of Christianity.

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.840 align:middle line:90%


00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.730 align:middle line:84%
The Maya defined
the physical world

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:26.360 align:middle line:84%
as a manifestation of the
spiritual and the spiritual

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:29.060 align:middle line:90%
as the essence of the material.

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:33.010 align:middle line:84%
The two were
inextricably linked.

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Action and interaction
with other world beings

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:38.440 align:middle line:84%
influences the
fate of the world.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:42.130 align:middle line:84%
The opposite is also true and
the Maya exploited patterns

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:44.770 align:middle line:84%
of energy in time and
space using ritual

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:47.260 align:middle line:84%
to control the
forces they released.

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Hence, rulers
functioned as shamans

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:52.450 align:middle line:84%
operating in both
dimensions and maintaining

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:55.495 align:middle line:84%
a balance between the two by
the application of ritual.

00:57:55.495 --> 00:58:01.320 align:middle line:90%


00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.060 align:middle line:84%
The main step
pyramid in Palenque

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:05.100 align:middle line:84%
stands at the foot of
the sacred mountain

00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:07.650 align:middle line:84%
on the west side of
the river, the Cardinal

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:10.050 align:middle line:90%
direction of Xibalba.

00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:13.080 align:middle line:84%
It faces the rising of
Venus at the equinox,

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.000 align:middle line:84%
the mark of the
enlightened initiate

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.840 align:middle line:84%
who transitions from
ignorance to awareness.

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:23.130 align:middle line:84%
At this time, in
3100 BC, Draco also

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:26.010 align:middle line:84%
appeared vertically above
it, at once commemorating

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:28.320 align:middle line:84%
the people of the serpent
as well as the beginning

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.870 align:middle line:84%
of the age when the
people began referring

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:32.400 align:middle line:90%
to themselves as Maya.

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.540 align:middle line:90%


00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Nine stages rise at
40 degrees, the angle

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.990 align:middle line:84%
of the nonagon, geometry
of utmost perfection,

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:46.010 align:middle line:84%
offering a hint as to the level
of teaching performed here.

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:50.600 align:middle line:84%
The ratio of its foundation is
equal to the note F, the summit

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:54.260 align:middle line:84%
temple and its doors
the note E. It seems

00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:57.440 align:middle line:90%
the building is a music box.

00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It is referred to as the
Temple of Inscriptions,

00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:03.830 align:middle line:84%
after an extensive hieroglyphic
panel describing Pacal's period

00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:06.490 align:middle line:90%
ending rituals.

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:09.490 align:middle line:84%
The inner chambers were
used for restricted ritual.

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But once it had reached the
end of its functional life,

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:18.120 align:middle line:84%
the building was finally sealed
and Pacal lay to rest inside.

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.150 align:middle line:84%
That Pacal was a high
initiate of the esoteric arts

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:24.960 align:middle line:84%
is revealed in the iconography
of the sarcophagus lid in which

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.305 align:middle line:84%
he is depicted in fetal position
on the trunk of the world tree.

00:59:28.305 --> 00:59:31.260 align:middle line:90%


00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:35.280 align:middle line:10%
Below him are the roots and
creative forces of nature,

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:39.030 align:middle line:10%
above, the fruit of the tree
and the branches holding up

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:41.050 align:middle line:10%
the Milky Way.

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:42.910 align:middle line:10%
The keepers of the
sacred books are

00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:47.680 align:middle line:10%
portrayed along the edges,
along with astronomical data.

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:50.950 align:middle line:84%
From beyond the grave,
Pacal whispers to us

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:53.200 align:middle line:84%
how he led the life
of the true adept

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and became a mediator
between the two worlds.

00:59:55.810 --> 00:59:59.120 align:middle line:90%


00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Pacal's son K'an Bahlam
followed his father's tradition

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:06.080 align:middle line:84%
by erecting a set of three
graceful temples east

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.630 align:middle line:84%
of the river, replicating
the establishment

01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:12.590 align:middle line:84%
of celestial order by
the creator God Ahau.

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Each building
features elaborately

01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:18.440 align:middle line:84%
carved reliefs depicting father
and son standing east and west

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.170 align:middle line:84%
of the axis of heaven
and earth, represented

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:24.970 align:middle line:90%
by a cross, the tree of life.

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Real and mythical
history is recorded along

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:31.270 align:middle line:84%
with instructional paths
into Xibalba used by the king

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:34.195 align:middle line:84%
to bring back gifts of life
and prosperity to his people.

01:00:34.195 --> 01:00:37.600 align:middle line:90%


01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.520 align:middle line:84%
At the temple of
the cross, a god

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.770 align:middle line:84%
guides K'an Bahlam
out of Xibalba

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:44.290 align:middle line:90%
and back to the physical world.

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:46.690 align:middle line:84%
The king has become a
physical manifestation

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:49.420 align:middle line:84%
of the axis of heaven,
emphasizing his role

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.910 align:middle line:90%
as the source of magical power.

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:54.820 align:middle line:84%
He was not just a practitioner
of ritual connecting the two

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
worlds, he represented
the path itself,

01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.845 align:middle line:90%
what the Maya called the way.

01:00:59.845 --> 01:01:02.510 align:middle line:90%


01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
In the third temple, Pacal hands
his son the scepter of power,

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:09.410 align:middle line:84%
while the tree of
life rises from Orion,

01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:11.510 align:middle line:90%
the place of creation.

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:14.720 align:middle line:84%
The scene demonstrates how the
rituals continued by the son

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
provide for the
rebirth of the father,

01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%
just as in Egypt,
Horus represents

01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:24.050 align:middle line:84%
a reborn Osiris who is himself
the earthly representation

01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:26.190 align:middle line:90%
of Orion.

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Both father and son wear
the ritual white apron

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:35.307 align:middle line:84%
worn by Egyptian pharaohs and
later adopted in Freemasonry.

01:01:35.307 --> 01:01:39.219 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:01:39.219 --> 01:01:45.100 align:middle line:90%


01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Deeper into Guatemala lies
Mutul known to the Maya

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.320 align:middle line:84%
as the place of prognostication,
a university reflecting

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.190 align:middle line:84%
the architecture of the cosmos,
a ceremonial center where

01:01:57.190 --> 01:02:02.030 align:middle line:84%
ancient teachers captured
sounds from other realities.

01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:03.680 align:middle line:90%
Today it is known as Tikal.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:14.270 align:middle line:90%


01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Tikal is home to the
tallest Maya pyramid.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Seven steep levels take
you to a summit enclosure

01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:24.930 align:middle line:90%
with walls 40 feet thick.

01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Standing outside it
and facing the jungle,

01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
the voices amplified from behind
and projected over the canopy

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
of trees in total violation
of the known laws of sound.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And no wonder, here the
architecture the sky

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:44.800 align:middle line:84%
built one of the finest
examples of sacred architecture.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.190 align:middle line:84%
They are said to have come
from the stars and spoke

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:52.240 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH],, the
language of light.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Teachers such as K'inich
Muwaan, Chak Tok Ich'aak, and Ix

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Kolo'mte made Tikal a temple
city that united science, art,

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, and religion as one,
giving rise to its other title,

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.160 align:middle line:84%
the place with
the sacred voices.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:15.250 align:middle line:90%


01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.980 align:middle line:84%
The Maya word for
pyramid is naku,

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
house of the god,
which also happens

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to be the name of the Egyptian
gods, the Aku, the shining

01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:26.290 align:middle line:90%
ones.

01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally, the angle
of slope of pyramid four

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:32.500 align:middle line:84%
is the same angle used
in the interior passage

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.075 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

01:03:34.075 --> 01:03:37.110 align:middle line:90%


01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid shape
acts like a needle,

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:42.000 align:middle line:84%
collecting Earth's
telluric currents,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
acupuncturing the ground
and the human body,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.300 align:middle line:84%
then linking with currents
flowing beyond the atmosphere

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.125 align:middle line:90%
and into space.

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:52.360 align:middle line:90%


01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Along with the understanding
of sacred geometry

01:03:54.490 --> 01:03:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and mathematics, such
buildings transmitted myths

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
explaining how the
universe works.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
The symbolism confirmed
a divine order

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.360 align:middle line:90%
juxtaposed on social structure.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Plazas and pyramids
replicated in symbolic form

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.350 align:middle line:84%
the sacred language originally
designed by the gods.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Thus they were also places where
communication between people

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:20.080 align:middle line:90%
and the gods took place.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
The design of courtyards,
entrances, and stairways

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:26.680 align:middle line:84%
spoke to the individual of
where they were allowed to go

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.000 align:middle line:90%
and where they were not.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And this was taught
from childhood.

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:34.020 align:middle line:84%
The most restricted ritual
temples and residences

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:36.600 align:middle line:90%
are reflected in their names--

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
pib nah, the underground house,
konsul, the conjuring place,

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:44.640 align:middle line:90%
and kun, the sacred seat.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:48.600 align:middle line:90%


01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
While the historical
buildings of Tikal

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:53.160 align:middle line:84%
date from around
