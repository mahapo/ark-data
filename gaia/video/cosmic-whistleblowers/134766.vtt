- [Woman] For decades,
NASA repeatedly stated

00:00:07.883 --> 00:00:10.677 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that there is no proof
of life in the universe

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.847 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and no evidence that
unidentified flying objects

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.516 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
are from other planets.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:20.437 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
But, in July of 2015,
the world’s most advanced

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:24.441 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
space agency made an
unprecedented announcement.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.362 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
A prediction that 
we will find other life

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:32.366 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and that it will be found
within our own galaxy.

00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Most astonishingly of all,
they placed a time frame

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.873 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
on what undoubtedly be
the most significant event

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.291 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
in human history.

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
NASA claimed that not only
will we find evidence of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.549 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
extraterrestrial life, they
stated that this discovery

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
will happen in the next 20
years.

Colonel William Blanchard --

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.621 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- [Simon] I’ve never understood
why we laugh at those people

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
who say they’ve seen UFOs.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We know from 
declassified documents

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:28.922 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
that whatever 
they are,

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:32.759 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
some of them are real,
and can’t be explained.

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:36.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- Back to the original Don
Schmitt,

00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:38.473 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
what are they hiding?

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.894 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- Well I think they’re hiding
first of all the fact that --

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:46.732 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Simon] There’s one UFO
case that never goes away,

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and some investigators
who will never give up

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:49.901 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
on the truth.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:51.445 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- It's one of the
reasons that we encourage

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the witnesses to come forward,

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:54.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
because after all --

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Simon] I’d made contact
with Donald Schmitt.

00:01:56.992 --> 00:01:58.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
He was still digging for
evidence

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:02.372 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
at the most famous crash
site in UFO history.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.875 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- [Donald] The fact that
they’d threatened these people,

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.794 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that they went 
into their homes.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.171 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Simon] I'd spent years
trying to get access

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to those last living
witnesses, and eventually,

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
I found my way in.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.803 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Donald] Actually
threatened physical violence

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.765 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
if they should ever talk
about this, this highly --

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:22.642 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Simon] After a lifetime of
wondering,

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.519 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
I was going to Roswell.

Overnight, the government
shutdown for the first time,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.497 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
partially, in 17 years --

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:45.248 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- The fiscal deadlock
between the White House

and GOP officials continues,

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
with the partial 
government shutdown.

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:49.878 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
- [Simon] The timing 
for the new dig

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.505 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
couldn’t have been worse.

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:53.423 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
The US was in shutdown.

00:02:57.552 --> 00:03:00.222 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
(phone dialing)

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:05.977 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- [Simon] Hi Don, I’ve
just landed in Albuquerque,

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:06.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
are we good to go?

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.855 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
- [Donald] Yes, hi Simon.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.774 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I don’t necessarily have the
best of news,

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I’m sorry but because of the
government shutdown here,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.822 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
as things would be
caught up in Washington,

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:19.199 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and specifically to the
Department of the Interior,

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
we may have to postpone.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- [Simon] But the bad
news didn’t end there.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
My first interview, and the
reason I’d flown to Albuquerque,

00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:29.418 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
had to cancel at the very last
second.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Eleazar Benavides, a retired
military man,

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is the only person alive who
says he saw

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:39.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the dead occupants of
the Roswell UFO crash.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.305 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Despite all the setbacks, I
had other witnesses to see,

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and Roswell was still 200 miles
away.

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:54.359 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The Roswell incident is
the most documented case

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
in UFO history,

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.906 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and the people connected
to it still living

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.658 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
get fewer every year.

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.244 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
If you want to get to those
witnesses,

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:07.539 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Donald Schmitt is the
man you need to speak to.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
He’s also one of the
few investigators left

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
still working on the case.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- You didn’t read about 
that in the press,

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.672 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
because again the press won’t
touch it,

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
this is considered taboo, this
is fringe.

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Simon] For more than
20 years, Schmitt has been

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:21.845 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
looking to prove that Roswell

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:25.015 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
was in fact an extraterrestrial
event.

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:29.936 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
- [Tom] The bodies came in.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
That was her story.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.148 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- [Simon] Don Schmitt
and his writing partner

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Tom Carey still work the
case more that 60 years

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:38.695 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
after the event happened.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.323 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- So you guys are still finding
witnesses,

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:43.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
like daughters and sons of
witnesses --

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.036 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- Daughters and sons and we
found two,

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:49.289 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
two first hand witnesses in
April.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
These were in the year book?

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:51.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
- Yes.

00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:53.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
You had a room set up?

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.128 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- [Simon] But there was
someone else at the meeting

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.796 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
I wasn’t expecting.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Jaime Maussan is a Mexican
journalist who’s been

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:01.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
reporting on UFOs for years.

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:06.389 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
(announcer speaking foreign
language)

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.603 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
A long time supporter of
Schmitt and Carey’s work,

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:15.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Maussan is another prominent
figure in the UFO scene.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:19.653 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
(announcer speaking foreign
language)

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- So I think we have
plenty of seating space.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.201 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Simon] So the dig was back
on,

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.495 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and Schmitt was busy prepping
the troops.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.665 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- Appropriate clothing,
appropriate footwear --

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Simon] But this mixed
team of investigators,

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:36.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
photographers and loyal
followers were already set

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:39.339 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
for the early start the next
morning.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.008 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
(intense music)

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.892 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
- [Tom] Light 'em up!

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:00.527 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- [Simon] Searching for
fragments of

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:04.698 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
a real flying saucer felt
a long way from reality.

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But Don meant business
and he kept the precise

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.998 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
location coordinates a
closely guarded secret.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:24.342 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%

28 years --

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
- [Man] We have another one.

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:36.855 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
- [Man] Somebody’s 
got my gloves.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.356 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
I wonder who that is.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.232 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
- [Woman] It's me, 
do you need them?

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.902 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- [Man] Somebody didn’t
plan ahead did they?

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:47.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Simon] How confident
are you of the position?

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:48.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
The actual..

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:49.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
- This being the site?

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Simon] The two positions
you’ve just pointed out now.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:55.457 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- It's where we left off last
time.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:58.918 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's about 30 yards,
for about three hours.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So we’re going to work down to
that flag,

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:04.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and then as I describe
each grid, we’re going to,

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
and then move out.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.803 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And so because we’ve
already mapped out the site

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we’ve laid out the grid in the
past.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:13.183 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And now it's the focus on
this one area that's been

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.392 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
the most promising.

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:16.561 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- Can you take a look at this
one here?

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.688 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Simon] While the team got
to grips with technicalities,

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I thought I’d see what Jaime
Maussan

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
had to say about the dig.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But he was more interested
in telling me about

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
new evidence on Roswell.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:29.491 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Some old pictures that showed
strange looking bodies.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:32.744 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- Do you know about the
photographs that they’ve found?

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
There are two photographs, two
slides,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.416 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
where you can see the bodies.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.585 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But there is something
in the photographs that

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
they don’t trust is,

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:46.675 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they are codified, and they
don’t know what is says.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.552 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And they are afraid this could
be a hoax

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
or a trick or a catch or
something just to, to...

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.061 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Expose them as, as fools.

00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:00.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I said, “why don’t
you release them now?”

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:04.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And they said, "We have
to be very careful because

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
"we don’t want to be exposed."

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.241 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Simon] I'd been tipped off
about slides of a dead alien

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:14.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
back in the UK, and as
dubious as it sounded,

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.746 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
there was obviously more to it.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
But I’d got someone to
see back in Roswell.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.126 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
His father had been on the base
in ’47

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:23.086 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
at the time of the crash.

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.797 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He’d never spoken on camera
before.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:28.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
(mysterious music)

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:38.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- With the US government,
is known to cover up things,

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.563 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
I mean factual.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:42.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
- [Simon] Yeah, of course.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.774 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- I was involved in one which
was the,

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:48.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the pursuit of the Khmer Rouge
in Cambodia in 1974 and '75,

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:54.159 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because I was in Viet Nam and,
they didn’t admit that until,

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
what, 15 or 20 years ago.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.372 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- [Simon] Gary’s father had
been on the airbase the very day

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.916 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that the Roswell incident
happened.

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:05.462 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- My father was stationed
here on the 509th and,

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:08.673 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
had top secret clearance,
and was a flight engineer

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:11.593 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
on the B-29s at that point in
time.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
If in fact it had been
a benign military test

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:22.270 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
or a weather balloon, they
would have talked about it.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- What do you think he
witnessed, yourself?

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- He knew the pilot’s names,
he had flown with them,

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:32.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
he had been to Patterson
Air Force base many times.

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:35.784 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It was a cover up, I mean
it's evident, I mean...

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.495 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
These guys came to town
and drank, you know,

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
when they were off a lot,
hard partiers, warriors,

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.502 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and I just can’t fathom
that all of a sudden

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:48.213 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
everything was just
turned off like a faucet,

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:50.423 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that there was no talk,
there was no gossip,

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:54.302 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
there was no scuttlebutt,
I, I don’t buy that.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.805 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I was in the service myself,
I know how that works.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.056 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
- [Simon] Yeah.

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:06.773 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- We all tend to agree that
the older people that were here

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:10.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
at the time that were subdued,
or coerced or threatened,

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:15.824 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that they were shut down for a
reason.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Okay here it is, this is
building 84, this is it.

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.379 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Simon] Gary had more to
say, but he had to wait.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:31.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I had someone else lined
up who’d also never spoken

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:35.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
on camera before, the once
son in law of Dan Dwyer,

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:38.012 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the fireman who saw the UFO
wreckage.

00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:42.475 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- I heard this story
from Dan Dwyer in 1959.

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:45.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
I was going into the army, and I

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.107 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
was out in the front yard
with him, and he said,

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.234 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
"I want to tell you something
Ken,

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:54.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
"that people don’t talk about,
but it...

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:58.741 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
"Involves the alien incident.

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.744 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
"Our fire crew from the
Roswell fire department

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:04.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
"was one of the first on scene."

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.875 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
He said, "When we got
there, we’ve seen things

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.586 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
"like you’ve never seen before.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.629 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
"There were two",

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:14.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I’m going to call them creatures
the way he described it.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
"They were dead.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:21.472 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
"And there was pieces
scattered all over the pasture.

00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:24.517 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
"Within two days
government people showed up

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
"talking to the families of...

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.274 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
"The people who had been on
site,

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.276 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"and were told to keep their
mouths shut,

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:36.362 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
"not to discuss it with
each other or anyone,

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:39.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
"or basically the
families would be split up

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
"and they’d never see each other
again."

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
That was the threats, it scared
the heck out of the kids.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
So, no one ever talked about it.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.542 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Simon] Ken seemed sincere,
but his story was a long way

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.795 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
from the official version of
events.

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:57.258 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- [Woman] On July 3rd 1947,
something exploded mid air

00:11:57.258 --> 00:12:00.386 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
near to Roswell New Mexico,
and came down leaving wreckage

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:02.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
sprawled over a square mile.

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:08.144 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The US Air Force say what
crashed was a military device,

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
being flown for Project Mogul,

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:13.191 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a top secret program monitoring
the nuclear activities

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
of the Soviet Union.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They also claimed what
witnesses saw were just

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.531 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
crash test dummies, dropped
from a great height,

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:24.285 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and that little grey men
never entered the equation.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Case closed?

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:27.372 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Afraid not.

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This fourth official
explanation was given 50 years

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
after the event.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:36.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In 1994 the Army Air Force had
put out its third explanation

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
admitting it had lied after all,

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.177 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
with its weather balloon
story back in '47,

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:44.180 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which was actually its second
explanation.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.348 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
Confused?

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
That was the idea.

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:51.771 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
In 1947, three hours after
its first press release,

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the US Army Air Force,
as it was then called,

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.109 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
claimed that this first
statement,

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:59.404 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the one admitting they had
retrieved a real flying saucer,

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
was also incorrect, and
that it was nothing more

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
than a simple weather balloon.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.453 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
All in all, four official
explanations

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:11.332 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
over a 50 year period and
officially three sets of lies,

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:15.503 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
admitted to by the military
themselves, all on record.

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:19.215 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- [Simon] It was the last day of
the dig.

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.676 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And it seemed like the
pressure was to find something.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:24.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
(all talking softly)

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.639 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- Turn by turn coordinates
on getting out there

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.641 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
decided to go and turn, well it
was,

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I turned on my computer --

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.685 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
- Yeah, yeah.

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:45.241 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
- [Simon] The convoy 
was in a hurry,

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and took a different route in.

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:50.121 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And as I held back for the
Mexican crew to keep up,

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:53.207 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the rest vanished in the dust
clouds.

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:56.544 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Within minutes, we were lost.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:01.591 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Is this it?

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:03.509 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Is this it?

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.513 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The only man with coordinates
had left us behind,

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:11.684 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and there were roads to
nowhere in every direction.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.313 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
Yeah.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It's all pretty difficult.

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:25.865 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Which way was it now?

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
To the left?
- Left.

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:29.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
- Was it left?

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
We were miles from civilization,

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:40.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and we’d been lost for nearly an
hour.

00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:45.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
That was them.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:56.854 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
- [Donald] Just stay 
with us now.

00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:58.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
- [Jaime] Yes, please.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:01.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
- [Simon] Guys, what happened?

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
- You lost us.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.695 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- No, we were behind, you lost
us!

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:07.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- We were doing about 40 all the
while,

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:09.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
we were making sure, and
the others all kept up,

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.745 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but we’re okay now, stay with
us.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.332 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- I promise you I won’t forget
after this.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
- [Donald] Okay.

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.587 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- [Simon] Glad to be back
on track, as Don drove away

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.548 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
at his version of 40 miles an
hour,

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:27.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
there was a day I wouldn’t
forget on this trip,

00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:29.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the day I met with Frankie Rowe.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Her father was Dan Dwyer,

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the witness who had
shared his story with Ken.

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:35.768 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
She’d held some of the
fragments of the UFO,

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
in her own hands.

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:43.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- Well it was a few days after
I was at the fire station,

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.736 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that the military came to our
house.

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:50.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I saw the car when it
drove up the driveway,

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and it was a military car,
you know flags and all,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.997 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
they went all out for this.

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He started asking questions
first about

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:02.086 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
what did I think I saw?

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:07.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And I told him the whole
thing, I saw the material,

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:10.678 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I saw the state cop that
came down and he said,

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:12.597 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
"No you didn’t, you didn’t see
that."

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
I said, "Yes I did."

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So I came back at him
which made him angry.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And he’s very emphatic about it,

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:24.317 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
beating his hand with his night
stick,

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:28.112 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and telling me, I didn’t see all
this,

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:30.823 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I didn’t hear it and I
didn’t know about it,

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:33.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and if I ever talked about it,

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
or told anyone about
it the rest of my life,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.665 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
they would come after me.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He said, "This is a big desert
out here,

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
"nothing but a desert."

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.552 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He said, "We can take you out
there and bury your bodies

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:54.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
"and nobody will ever find you."

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:59.727 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Due to a phone outage on my
house phone,

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:03.731 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a telephone repairman
discovered that I had a...

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:09.528 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Wire on my phone that was
transmitting everything

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that came in or went out,
to some other location.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.118 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It could not have been there
when I bought the house

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
because I had my service put in,

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.625 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
repairmen were out there.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:26.796 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Someone installed it for
whatever purpose, I don’t know.

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:30.591 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
- [Woman] Just after the crash,

00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:33.594 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Mac Brazel found wreckage
on his sheep ranch.

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:36.514 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He took some fragments to
the town sheriff at Roswell,

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:39.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
who immediately called the intel
officer

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
at the Roswell Army base, Jesse
Marcel.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
This is where things
got much more serious.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
After retracting their initial
statement

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:51.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and publicly playing the event
down, the army then turned

00:17:51.362 --> 00:17:54.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the entire region upside down,
and threatened the witnesses

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:57.118 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
with their lives, if they
as much as whispered about

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:59.203 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
what had really happened.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.499 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
They even arrested Mac himself,

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:07.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
for simply reporting
it to the authorities.

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:10.631 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Locking him up, until he
was persuaded to say that

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:14.218 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
all he had seen was a weather
balloon.

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:16.512 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
But hundreds of witnesses
are now on record

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:20.975 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
saying this mundane explanation
is a complete fabrication.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Dozens of credible professionals
with everything to lose

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:27.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and nothing to gain, say
the official story is a lie,

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:29.191 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and that it was in fact an
object

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and persons of unknown origin.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:40.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Simon] My next connection
to the case was Fawn Fritz.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.746 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
She was the granddaughter of Mac
Brazel,

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:45.583 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the rancher who’d found the UFO
wreckage.

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
- It happened!

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.461 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Sorry, it happened!

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:49.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
It was here.

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:53.883 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They had trucks and trucks
of guys out here, dad said.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:56.135 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They were out here for
days and days and days.

00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
And they just didn’t come once,

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.931 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
they came back twice after that
too.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.726 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
(metal detector warbling)

00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:07.063 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Grandpa picked up what he
found, you know the pieces.

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:09.982 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And then they went back over to
Floyd’s,

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and he wanted to show them to
Floyd to get Floyd’s opinion

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.653 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of what he thought they were.

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:18.157 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And they sat there and had
coffee.

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:19.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Well how could he do that?

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:23.496 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Well he didn’t realize,
he had no conception,

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.415 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that there was a
spacecraft laying down here

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.876 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
in the ditch somewhere!

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:30.669 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I mean when the military come
out here,

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:33.506 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
they were out here for
days and days and days.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I mean they were walking
shoulder to shoulder.

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:41.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And if they even thought
that it was anything to do

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:43.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with the crash, they picked it
up.

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:47.853 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So I mean as far as there
being any pieces left no, no.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:11%
I...

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:55.361 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It's a waste of time
and money to even look.

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
- [Man In Hat] 
That’s a big chunky,

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
actually that's a nice artifact,

00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:04.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
'cause that's a big chunky
piece.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
- No, it's not a bullet.

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.998 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
You can see it's...

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- [Simon] So during the
last hours of the dig,

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.502 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
they’d found something;

00:20:11.502 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
A piece of metal which had
been buried under the earth,

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.883 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
strangely with no visible
corrosion.

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.261 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There’s so much strong
evidence on the Roswell case,

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:23.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
but this was a long way from it.

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:26.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- The truth is constantly,
just like the crash site,

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:29.145 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the debris field, the
truth has its way of always

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:31.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
coming to the surface.

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:35.025 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I for one am always
going to be watching for it.

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:37.528 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There are only two
possibilities for what happened

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:41.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
at Roswell in 1947: it's
either the greatest hoax

00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of all time involving hundreds
and hundreds of people,

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.165 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from all walks of life;
civilian, military, media,

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:50.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
the press, or...

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's the greatest story of the
millennium.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.673 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And, when that final
announcement is made,

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:03.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
when that final proof is
presented to the world,

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
I want to be there.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Simon] But when it came
to talking about the slides,

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:10.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Don was still being guarded.

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:15.024 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I thought I might have more
luck with his research partner,

00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:15.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Tom Carey.

00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:18.235 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Just tell me if you will,
there’s,

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:19.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
you’re working on something new,

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.030 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you can’t tell me very much
about it,

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.282 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
can you explain a little
about what that is and why

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.408 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
you can’t discuss it?

00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:26.869 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- Well I will tell you 
a little bit about,

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:28.913 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
perhaps our most 
important project

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:31.165 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
that we’re 
working  on now

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:35.336 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is a, a third party has come
into possession of some...

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:37.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
Items.

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
And they date from 1947.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Now Don Schmitt and I want
to get our own analysis,

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
we’re not going to sign on
to something that blows up

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in our face, in this
business that’s terminal.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So I can tell you that right
now,

00:21:55.981 --> 00:22:00.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
these items as I have viewed
them, are compelling to me.

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And if they pan out, and
go all the way through

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.787 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the due diligence process and
come out

00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:12.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
at the end of the line
authentic,

00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:16.627 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
then in my mind we have
a significant proof for

00:22:17.461 --> 00:22:21.465 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the Roswell event as an
extraterrestrial event.

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:25.844 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Simon] So according to Tom,
they could well be sat on the

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:28.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
story of the millennium.

00:22:28.222 --> 00:22:31.475 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But it was time to leave,
and I'd still not met anyone

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:34.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
who had been part of the cover
up.

00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:39.733 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I had one chance left, and he
lived somewhere in Alabama.

00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:43.946 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
He’s the only surviving
member of the air crew

00:22:43.946 --> 00:22:48.117 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who flew the wreckage to a
secret government location.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.745 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I hoped if anyone could tell
me what happened on that

00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:55.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
July day in ’47 that it might
be this guy, Arthur Osepchook.

00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:03.716 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Flight Announcer] Welcome
to Mobile Regional Airport.

00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:05.676 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Your safety is important to us.

00:23:05.676 --> 00:23:07.803 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Please stay with your
baggage and personal items

00:23:07.803 --> 00:23:08.887 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
at all times.

00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:12.057 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- [Simon] Arthur, already in his
90s,

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:15.352 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
lives not far from a place
called Mobile,

00:23:15.352 --> 00:23:17.396 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
strangely enough where Steven
Spielberg

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:20.232 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
filmed the final scene
to his 70s UFO classic:

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:23.444 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Close Encounters of the Third
Kind.

00:23:23.444 --> 00:23:25.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It felt weirdly appropriate.

00:23:31.452 --> 00:23:33.704 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I’d worked years for a day like
this,

00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:36.081 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and I couldn’t wait to
hear what he had to say.

00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:36.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
How you doing?

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:37.875 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
- [Arthur] Pretty good.

00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:39.293 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- [Simon] I spoke with
Arthur while he was at home

00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:41.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
with his family.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:45.341 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- I was a side gunner, and
then they had the right gunner.

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We shared a turret and
we had a tail gunner.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Simon] Ozzy and his
crew had had the highest

00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:52.890 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
top secret clearance in the
military.

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.809 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The 509th Wing Command Group
were responsible for carrying

00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:57.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
the atomic bomb.

00:23:58.771 --> 00:24:01.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- Whatever they wanted to move
from the base was top secret.

00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:05.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But what shocked me when he
got that plane over the pit,

00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:08.656 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it was covered, and then they
covered the bomb bay doors

00:24:08.656 --> 00:24:11.075 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and they told us to get off the
air plane.

00:24:11.075 --> 00:24:14.495 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It was surprising, I had
a top secret clearance.

00:24:14.495 --> 00:24:16.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Simon] So that was unusual,
was it?

00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:17.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
- It was very unusual.

00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:22.336 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We were shocked, it hurt
our pride a little bit!

00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:23.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Simon] It seemed
incredible, that a crew with

00:24:23.754 --> 00:24:26.965 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
high top secret clearance
weren’t allowed to see

00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:30.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
what had been loaded
onto their own aircraft.

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- Then when we got back to
Roswell,

00:24:32.513 --> 00:24:34.807 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that's when they told us
to keep our mouths shut.

00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:36.100 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I remember, "You don’t tell
anybody,

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.977 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
"you don’t tell your wives,
you don’t talk to anybody,

00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:41.355 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
"you don’t talk to each other
about it."

00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:42.856 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
No one knew about this mission,

00:24:42.856 --> 00:24:44.608 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
when we weren't to Fort
Worth, it was all secret.

00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:47.569 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
See, none of the base crew
members knew about it,

00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:49.321 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
we never talked about it.

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:51.782 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They really scared us when we
come back.

00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:54.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This was the most top
secret thing I ever seen

00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:56.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
when I was in the Air Force.

00:24:58.247 --> 00:24:59.081 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
- You take good care.

00:24:59.081 --> 00:24:59.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
- Hang in there now.

00:24:59.915 --> 00:25:00.749 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
- I will.

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:02.584 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
What had they flown to Fort
Worth Texas?

00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:04.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
We might never know.

00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:07.256 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Don eventually agreed to
set up a meeting with the

00:25:07.256 --> 00:25:09.425 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
owner of the slides, but
he still wouldn’t give up

00:25:09.425 --> 00:25:13.345 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the contact details of the last
witness.

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:17.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Donald] I will contact
Eleazar and then I will also

00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:20.644 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
talk to the owners of the
slides.

00:25:20.644 --> 00:25:24.732 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Simon] I just hoped it
wouldn’t take too long.

00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:31.029 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I was still waiting for the
interview Don had promised me

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:33.157 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
with the owner of the slides.

00:25:33.157 --> 00:25:35.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And then a strange thing
happened.

00:25:35.993 --> 00:25:37.536 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
- Welcome back.

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:40.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
President Bill Clinton
is here with us, so --

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.417 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
If I was president, and I
won’t be, let’s be honest.

00:25:43.417 --> 00:25:44.585 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
(audience laughs)

00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:47.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The first thing I would
do after putting my hand

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:50.549 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
on that bible and taking that
oath, to serve the country,

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:52.885 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is, I would, I wouldn’t even
probably finish the oath.

00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:55.429 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
I would run to the White House,

00:25:55.429 --> 00:25:58.724 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I’d demand to see all the
classified files on the UFOs.

00:25:58.724 --> 00:26:01.018 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
(audience laughs)

00:26:01.018 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
‘Cause I’d wanna know,

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I’d wanna know what has been
going on.

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Did you do that?

00:26:05.814 --> 00:26:06.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
- Sort of.

00:26:06.732 --> 00:26:07.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
- Sort of?

00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:08.567 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
(audience laughs)

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
- Yeah we had...

00:26:10.194 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I think it was at the
beginning of my second term,

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
we had an anniversary of
Roswell.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I knew we’d get, you
know, zillions of letters,

00:26:17.201 --> 00:26:20.370 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
so I had all the Roswell papers
reviewed.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.663 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Everything.

00:26:21.663 --> 00:26:25.334 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- If you saw that there were
aliens there would you tell us?

00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:26.168 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
- Yeah.

00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:27.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
- [Jimmy] You would?

00:26:27.002 --> 00:26:30.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
(audience cheering and
applauding)

00:26:30.172 --> 00:26:33.008 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- [Simon] A US President had
admitted on national television

00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:36.345 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
he’d asked to see the Roswell
documents.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.516 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The connection between
UFOs and US politics

00:26:40.516 --> 00:26:42.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
wasn’t going away.

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:47.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
(plane engine roars)

00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:02.079 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Stephen Bassett is a political
activist,

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and the only lobbyist in
the US on what he describes

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
at the ET issue.

00:27:07.918 --> 00:27:10.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- The problem in this
field is not scientific,

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.965 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it hasn’t been, this issue
has been proven 50 years ago.

00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:16.343 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This is a political problem,
it's a political policy.

00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:17.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
You can’t solve it with science,

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.137 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
you have to solve it with
political engagement.

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:21.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And so, okay, I know
Washington, I’ve been there,

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:22.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I’ve lived there a lot of
times, I’m going down there,

00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:25.143 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I’m going to engage the ET
issue.

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Politically.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.564 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Simon] In 2013, Bassett
organized

00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:32.025 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the Citizen Hearing on
Disclosure, a serious attempt

00:27:32.025 --> 00:27:35.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
at engaging Capitol Hill, on
what he claims is an ongoing

00:27:35.529 --> 00:27:39.867 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
truth embargo, concerning
an extraterrestrial reality.

00:27:39.867 --> 00:27:43.078 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Like many, Bassett argues
there’s an ET reality

00:27:43.078 --> 00:27:46.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
being covered up, and that
UFOs are just the side show.

00:27:46.874 --> 00:27:48.876 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The difference is that
he’s turned this belief

00:27:48.876 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
into a full time job.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:55.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Every advocacy movement
that has been of success

00:27:55.048 --> 00:27:58.343 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and importance, had a defined
prize.

00:27:58.343 --> 00:28:01.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The women’s right to vote
movement, that was a no brainer.

00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:03.307 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We want their right to
vote, we want the amendment.

00:28:03.307 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
They pushed, they got it.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
All right?

00:28:05.434 --> 00:28:07.311 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Civil Rights movement was
primarily about getting

00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:09.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
the Civil Right’s Act.

00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:11.732 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
What was the prize in the

00:28:11.732 --> 00:28:14.735 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
extraterrestrial phenomena
movement?

00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:18.196 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
We gave it a prize.

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:20.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
And that word turned up,

00:28:20.115 --> 00:28:22.743 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
started to emerge the very late
1990s,

00:28:22.743 --> 00:28:24.161 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
didn’t really get under
way until about 2000,

00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:25.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
called ‘disclosure’.

00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:26.622 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The formal acknowledgement of
this

00:28:26.622 --> 00:28:29.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
extraterrestrial presence,
by world governments,

00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:31.960 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
starting most likely with
the single government.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
That is disclosure.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
That is the prize.

00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:35.005 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
That is what we’re seeking.

00:28:35.005 --> 00:28:37.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
(applauding)

00:28:38.508 --> 00:28:40.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Simon] I wasn’t sure if
this was inspired, brave,

00:28:40.636 --> 00:28:42.721 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
or completely insane.

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:45.223 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Maybe it was all three.

00:28:45.223 --> 00:28:47.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Richard Dolan is a respected
author and UFO researcher,

00:28:47.893 --> 00:28:50.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
who began as a political
historian.

00:28:50.687 --> 00:28:54.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I wanted his take on US politics
and UFOs.

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:55.609 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- It wasn’t really until the
United States

00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:57.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Freedom of Information
Act became significant

00:28:57.778 --> 00:29:01.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in the late 1970s, that some
researchers were able to,

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:03.158 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
as it were, shake that tree and
documents

00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:04.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
started falling out.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.704 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
When you have objects described
in

00:29:07.704 --> 00:29:10.749 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
formerly classified government
memos as being disc shaped,

00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:14.419 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
as invading sensitive airspace,
as being able to outperform

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:17.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
our best interceptors, and
when you can see from the tone

00:29:17.673 --> 00:29:19.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of the memos that this
is a very serious matter

00:29:19.508 --> 00:29:21.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and how could it not be?

00:29:21.677 --> 00:29:25.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Then clearly there’s
something important happening.

00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:27.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You would wonder, "Well
great, so where’s the larger

00:29:27.808 --> 00:29:29.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
"public discussion about this?

00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:31.144 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
"This is really interesting
information."

00:29:31.144 --> 00:29:32.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And I’ve been asking myself that
question

00:29:32.688 --> 00:29:34.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
ever since I’ve been in this
field.

00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:36.525 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
My conclusion is that there’s
been a tremendous amount

00:29:36.525 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of control and manipulation
over what we call

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
mainstream media, over our
political institutions,

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:42.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
our academic institutions,

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:44.032 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and I think that’s really what’s
happened.

00:29:44.032 --> 00:29:46.284 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- My hand would just, it'd still
be hot

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:47.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
from touching the bible,

00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:52.666 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and I would immediately
race to wherever they hold,

00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:56.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
have the files about Area 51 and
the UFOs,

00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:59.297 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and I’d go through everything
to find out what happened.

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:00.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Did you do that?

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- That’s why you will not be
President.

00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:05.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
(audience cheering applauding)

00:30:05.887 --> 00:30:09.558 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Because that’s the first
thing that you would do.

00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:12.394 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
(both laughing)

00:30:12.394 --> 00:30:13.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
- It's at the top of my --

00:30:13.228 --> 00:30:14.104 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
The aliens won’t let it happen.

00:30:14.104 --> 00:30:15.313 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
(audience laughs)

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:18.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
You’ll reveal all their secrets.

00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:21.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They exercise strict control
over us.

00:30:21.153 --> 00:30:22.571 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- When a President, or a former
President,

00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:24.448 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
appears on a TV show like that,

00:30:24.448 --> 00:30:27.492 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
nothing is left open to
chance, not a single thing.

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:29.953 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So clearly Obama’s people
and Clinton’s people

00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:31.872 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
made an arrangement and said,

00:30:31.872 --> 00:30:34.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
“We’re going to talk about
these few things here”,

00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:37.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
so what we really want
to be asking is why,

00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:39.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
why would Barack Obama and
why would Bill Clinton want to

00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:43.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
talk about UFOs with Jimmy
Kimmel?

00:30:43.008 --> 00:30:44.843 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- [Simon] It was a good
question.

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:47.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Stephen Bassett had some
ideas on the answer.

00:30:47.304 --> 00:30:49.306 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It went back to ties between the
Clintons

00:30:49.306 --> 00:30:53.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and one of America’s richest
families, the Rockefellers.

00:30:54.436 --> 00:30:55.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- Laurance Rockefeller
approached

00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:58.273 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the Clinton Administration 
of March 29th of 1993.

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:01.735 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
He’s a billionaire
friend of the Clintons,

00:31:01.735 --> 00:31:05.072 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
big donor to the democratic
party.

00:31:05.072 --> 00:31:07.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
He approached the administration
with the intent of

00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:10.202 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
convincing President Clinton to
release

00:31:10.202 --> 00:31:11.953 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
all of the UFO files.

00:31:13.163 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And thus began the Rockefeller
Initiative

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.667 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
which lasted for three years.

00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:19.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Meetings were held amongst
researchers,

00:31:19.294 --> 00:31:20.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
many of which are still alive,

00:31:20.462 --> 00:31:22.047 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
at Rockefeller’s ranch in
Wyoming.

00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:23.924 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Then the Clintons went
out in ’95 and met with

00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:28.845 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the Rockefellers at that ranch,
where this was discussed.

00:31:28.845 --> 00:31:31.139 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
By October of 1996 it had run
its course,

00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:33.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the files were not released,
disclosure did not happen,

00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:38.146 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Clinton was running for
re-election, and that was that.

00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:43.485 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
16 months after President
Clinton was out of office,

00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:46.154 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
his former key advisor,
and Chief of Staff,

00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:49.282 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
John Podesta, came to
the National Press Club,

00:31:49.282 --> 00:31:51.993 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and introduced a new
organization called the

00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:53.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Coalition for the Freedom of
Information.

00:31:53.662 --> 00:31:57.666 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And in the introduction he
makes a very profound statement

00:31:57.666 --> 00:31:59.251 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
which is now on the internet.

00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:02.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- I think its time to open
the books on questions

00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:05.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which have remained in the
dark on the question of,

00:32:05.966 --> 00:32:10.011 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of, government investigations
of, of UFOs.

00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:13.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's time to find out
what the truth really is

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:15.225 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
that’s out there.

00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:17.686 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We ought to do it really
because its right,

00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:20.313 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
we ought to do it because
the American people

00:32:20.313 --> 00:32:22.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
quite frankly can handle the
truth,

00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:26.486 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and we ought to do it because
its the law.

00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:29.948 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- Who does Barack Obama
pick to be his Chairman

00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:32.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of his transition team to
create the new government?

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:35.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
John Podesta, who called
for the release of UFO files

00:32:35.704 --> 00:32:38.915 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
twice and was involved in
the Rockefeller Initiative.

00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And they get together and
who do they pick to be

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.502 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
the Secretary of State?

00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:44.087 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Hilary Clinton.

00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:46.423 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
So with all of that background,

00:32:46.423 --> 00:32:48.842 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
now someone can understand why,

00:32:48.842 --> 00:32:51.678 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
with the Rockefeller initiative
imminent,

00:32:51.678 --> 00:32:53.805 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
possibly as major news
and them having to answer

00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:57.976 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a whole lot of questions,
Podesta puts out that tweet.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Simon] So there it was, an
undeniable connection to UFOs,

00:33:02.606 --> 00:33:06.276 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
all the way to the
White House, and beyond.

00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:22.042 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It had been months since Don
had returned any of my calls.

00:33:22.042 --> 00:33:26.087 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I thought the evidence of the
slides might have fizzled out.

00:33:26.087 --> 00:33:29.174 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But I couldn’t have been more
wrong.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.345 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- [Woman] Now has this been
released, to the public?

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:34.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
- [Man] No, not yet.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And the government knows you
have this?

00:33:37.974 --> 00:33:40.060 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
You’re not scared of ‘em?

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:44.731 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Man] Here’s what I know, so
far.

00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:46.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Several months ago I was given a
box of

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:49.653 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
400 color Kodachrome slides
that appear to have been taken

00:33:49.653 --> 00:33:53.198 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
over a ten year period
staring in the mid 1940s.

00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:55.825 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Now I’m a sports guy, I
cover sports for living.

00:33:55.825 --> 00:33:57.786 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I’m not making any
claims as to what exactly

00:33:57.786 --> 00:33:59.329 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
is in these two slides.

00:33:59.329 --> 00:34:00.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Simon] So there was
someone else making a film

00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:03.959 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
about the slides, and I’d
been cut out of the loop,

00:34:03.959 --> 00:34:07.462 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
despite all the assurances from
Don.

00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:09.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And it was Jaime Maussan
who would host the event

00:34:09.631 --> 00:34:11.049 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
from Mexico City.

00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:20.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
After being kept waiting
for more than a year,

00:34:20.517 --> 00:34:23.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it felt like I’d been hung out
to dry.

00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:30.026 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Whatever the reason, I wanted to
know why.

00:34:30.026 --> 00:34:31.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
I had to go to Mexico.

00:34:31.653 --> 00:34:34.322 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
(intense music)

00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:52.340 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
(phone ringing)

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.174 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
- Hola.

00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:54.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
- Jaime.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
How are you doing?

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:57.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Nice to see you again.

00:34:57.178 --> 00:34:58.013 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
Been a long time.

00:34:58.013 --> 00:34:59.931 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
It felt like a reunion.

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:11%
Tom.

00:35:01.141 --> 00:35:03.435 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But Don was still nowhere to be
seen.

00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:04.269 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I remember you 
from that windy day...

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:06.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Then this guy walked through the
door.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.565 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I didn't know who he was at
first.

00:35:08.565 --> 00:35:09.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
It was Adam Dew.

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:12.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
But then it all clicked.

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.196 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It turned out that Dew 
was also the person

00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:16.031 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
behind the film Kodachrome.

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:19.617 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So as well as being the
owner of the slides,

00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:21.453 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
he was making his own film,

00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:24.914 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and was here in Mexico to
promote both.

00:35:24.914 --> 00:35:26.624 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It was all starting to make
sense,

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:29.127 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and I could see why I had
been cut out of the loop;

00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:31.296 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
It was all about money.

00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:34.924 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
(Jaime speaking foreign
language)

00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:36.843 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Maussan had somehow
persuaded Richard Dolan

00:35:36.843 --> 00:35:38.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
into being involved.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.389 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- Are you happy to be part of
this?

00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:42.223 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
- I’m, I’m sorry?

00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:43.558 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- Are you happy to be 
part of this event?

00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:46.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- Oh yes, yes, yes, but I
didn’t accept immediately,

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:48.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
I had to think about it.

00:35:48.605 --> 00:35:49.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
- You did.

00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:51.858 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- There’s the risk that
you might be wrong.

00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:55.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
That’s what life is, and, so
we can, we can ignore the risk

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:58.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and just hide under a rock
for the rest of our lives

00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:01.534 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and not investigate, or we
can put ourselves out there

00:36:01.534 --> 00:36:03.203 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and give it a shot.

00:36:04.454 --> 00:36:06.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Simon] As Adam Dew wouldn’t
speak to me on camera,

00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:08.208 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and still with no sign of
Schmitt,

00:36:08.208 --> 00:36:11.211 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
they’d left Jaime to face the
music.

00:36:11.211 --> 00:36:13.004 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I don’t suppose you ever
expected you would be doing

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:13.838 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
anything like this?

00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:17.175 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- No, I never expected to be
doing this.

00:36:18.051 --> 00:36:22.222 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Everything started when I met
you in the digging in 2013,

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
then I proposed this
possibility,

00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:31.981 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and they liked the idea, to
do it in a credible venue,

00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:34.567 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and it was very slow,
it took more than a year

00:36:34.567 --> 00:36:36.319 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to put everything together.

00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:37.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
- [Simon] In less than 24 hours,

00:36:37.946 --> 00:36:39.864 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
he would be presenting
pictures to the world

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:44.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which he claimed would prove
that aliens are here on earth.

00:36:48.498 --> 00:36:51.501 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So a big name, Edgar
Mitchell, had pulled out,

00:36:51.501 --> 00:36:55.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but I’d heard that Don
Schmitt was on stage.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:01.261 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I thought I’d wait for the
right moment, before I spoke.

00:37:10.937 --> 00:37:13.940 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
- We do mention many names,

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
so you’ll just repeat
them as you hear them.

00:37:15.984 --> 00:37:16.818 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
- Okay.

00:37:16.818 --> 00:37:18.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- So they'll be pronounced
correctly --

00:37:18.278 --> 00:37:19.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Simon] Despite waiting 18
months

00:37:19.821 --> 00:37:21.906 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and travelling thousands of
miles,

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:25.285 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
my patience had to hold out a
bit longer.

00:37:27.704 --> 00:37:30.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Outside, up to 10,000
people were waiting to

00:37:30.457 --> 00:37:34.627 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
see pictures of what they
thought could be an alien body.

00:37:49.225 --> 00:37:52.228 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:37:52.228 --> 00:37:56.399 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
(Jaime speaking foreign
language)

00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:32.060 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- [Simon] It feels to me
like you’re already preparing

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
for battle before the day.

00:38:34.896 --> 00:38:38.399 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- No, its because I’ve been
in battle before the day.

00:38:38.399 --> 00:38:41.319 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I’ve been in battle for three
months.

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:43.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Probably if I was wrong in
something,

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:47.700 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
if I thought this was real, and
it wasn’t,

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.786 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and somebody proved that,

00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:54.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
then I would accept that
I’d probably made a mistake.

00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:56.960 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
But now, I feel so confident.

00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:01.965 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- All the documents from
Roswell had been destroyed,

00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:06.135 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
surrounding the incident,
and if we believe that as

00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:10.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Congressman Schiff didn’t,
we realise that we were

00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:14.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
really getting close to
something extremely sensitive,

00:39:14.227 --> 00:39:16.062 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
extremely classified.

00:39:18.231 --> 00:39:21.192 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- People like Don Schmitt
and Tom Carey, they have

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:25.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
dedicated their life to do
the Roswell investigation

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.156 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
more than anybody else.

00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:30.785 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
How can they think that
they are so dumb that they

00:39:30.785 --> 00:39:34.539 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
are going to present a mummy,
or a child, or something?

00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:36.291 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- Do you think its possible
that they are doing it,

00:39:36.291 --> 00:39:39.752 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
because, they think the
subject is so serious

00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:43.339 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that something like this
might damage the subject?

00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:46.384 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- Honestly, some of them
think especially after

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:50.179 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the Santilli autopsy, after 20
years,

00:39:50.179 --> 00:39:54.726 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
somebody’s coming back with
the same, you know, lie.

00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:57.729 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Then they think that they
should have stopped us,

00:39:57.729 --> 00:40:01.899 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
some of them, before we damaged
this phenomenon for them.

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:05.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- [Simon] There’s going to
be a very obvious criticism,

00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:07.614 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that's going to come from one
direction.

00:40:07.614 --> 00:40:10.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And the direction is,
you’re making a lot of money

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.702 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
out of this event, or you might
be.

00:40:12.702 --> 00:40:14.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
(laughs)

00:40:14.037 --> 00:40:17.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
- No, I’m risking so much money.

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:20.543 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I don’t know if I’m going to
get it back, I don’t care.

00:40:20.543 --> 00:40:23.338 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Just the auditorium costs
you more than $100,000,

00:40:23.338 --> 00:40:27.258 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
$130,000 for one day, and the
tickets,

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:29.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and the rights that I had to
pay,

00:40:29.302 --> 00:40:33.765 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and the stage, and the
production, and the cameras,

00:40:33.765 --> 00:40:35.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and everything else.

00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:38.019 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
It's a lot of money, my friend.

00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:41.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
(crowd applauding)

00:40:44.567 --> 00:40:46.444 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- And while we all waited
for Adam Dew to show the

00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:48.821 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
world his alien pictures,
I noticed he never actually

00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:51.574 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
said they were pictures of an
alien.

00:40:51.574 --> 00:40:53.743 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- The first thing that we
decided to so was to try to

00:40:53.743 --> 00:40:57.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
read this mysterious placard
that appears in the case

00:40:57.747 --> 00:41:00.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that holds the body in the
photos.

00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:02.835 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
If we could read this
placard, mystery solved.

00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Man] Yeah, this one’s
actually more visible.

00:41:04.629 --> 00:41:06.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
- [Man] Roswell huh?

00:41:08.549 --> 00:41:09.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Man] Not sure whether
you’re going to be able to

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:11.511 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
get anything out of that.

00:41:11.511 --> 00:41:12.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
We’ll see.

00:41:12.929 --> 00:41:15.264 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- Sadly, Walker was correct,
we couldn’t really make

00:41:15.264 --> 00:41:17.183 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
anything clearly out of the
placard,

00:41:17.183 --> 00:41:21.771 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
there’s a list of several
others who made an effort

00:41:21.771 --> 00:41:22.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
but didn’t have much luck.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Simon] So, a mysterious
placard that couldn’t be read.

00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:27.360 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- Kodak also recommended
that we show the slides to

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a certain Kodachrome
historian, in Rochester.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:31.781 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
- [Simon] Photographic
specialists,

00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:34.867 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
that didn’t want to be named.

00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:37.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Was this all he had?

00:41:37.036 --> 00:41:38.287 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Apparently not.

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:42.625 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- If you think you might have
pictures of an alien body,

00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:44.377 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
you want to show them
to someone who claims

00:41:44.377 --> 00:41:46.754 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
that they've seen alien bodies.

00:41:46.754 --> 00:41:49.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He was a Private First Class
at Roswell Air Force Base

00:41:49.424 --> 00:41:50.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
in July of 1947.

00:41:50.258 --> 00:41:51.509 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- [Simon] It was Eleazar
Benavides,

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.761 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the Roswell witness I’d
been waiting to speak with,

00:41:53.761 --> 00:41:54.679 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
since 2013.

00:41:56.055 --> 00:41:59.308 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- A copy, I just say if this is
a copy,

00:42:02.603 --> 00:42:04.355 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
they did pretty good.

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:09.527 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
(Jamie speaking foreign
language)

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:34.343 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- [Simon] It was definitely
a strange looking body.

00:42:34.343 --> 00:42:35.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
But proof of aliens?

00:42:35.928 --> 00:42:38.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
According to the science, yes.

00:42:38.097 --> 00:42:40.141 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
And there was lots of it.

00:42:41.976 --> 00:42:45.646 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
(speaking foreign language)

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:54.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
- I’m a former retired academic,

00:42:54.906 --> 00:42:58.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
who at times worked in
fields like human evolution,

00:42:58.743 --> 00:43:01.954 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
primatology, comparative
anatomy.

00:43:01.954 --> 00:43:06.292 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
On closer examination, its
not a human being at all.

00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:08.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
It is not even a mammal.

00:43:11.214 --> 00:43:15.176 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Jaime had one trick left; a
20 foot high 3D holographic

00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:17.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
animation modeled from the
slides.

00:43:17.845 --> 00:43:20.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
(mysterious music)

00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:27.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
(crowd applauding)

00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:44.705 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The whole thing had
lasted over four hours,

00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:47.124 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and had felt totally surreal,

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:53.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
but there was one person
I still wanted to see.

00:43:57.802 --> 00:44:01.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
- I can assure you as of
tonight,

00:44:01.013 --> 00:44:03.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
all the attacks are going to
come from the United States.

00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:04.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Certain people who said,

00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:08.896 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
"Well just release it,
just come out with it",

00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:09.897 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and if that would 
have been the case,

00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:13.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
if we would have just released
the files to our peers,

00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:15.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
there would have been two camps:

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:18.114 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Those who want to believe
that they're genuine,

00:44:18.114 --> 00:44:20.658 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and those who, again...

00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:24.829 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Whose agenda is strictly to
destroy, but we took our time.

00:44:26.789 --> 00:44:29.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
There was analysis,
there was investigation.

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:31.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Biggest problem we ran
into in the States was

00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:35.089 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
we couldn’t get anybody to look
at these.

00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:38.092 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I’m mean, its true we can’t
prove...

00:44:39.635 --> 00:44:40.887 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
- I think we can.

00:44:40.887 --> 00:44:43.723 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Donald] But by
eliminating what it isn’t,

00:44:43.723 --> 00:44:44.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
- I mean, my friend,

00:44:44.557 --> 00:44:46.183 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
don't be so negative.
- That's all that's left.

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:47.685 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
No, no, that’s all that’s left,

00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:48.644 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
that’s all that’s left.

00:44:48.644 --> 00:44:50.104 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
- Don’t be so negative.

00:44:50.104 --> 00:44:54.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- We go home this week, and
we're going to have, you know,

00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:58.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
our friends call for
our heads, on a block.

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I mean, we’re not stating,
you know, it's alien,

00:45:00.907 --> 00:45:04.869 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
but the point is, what else
could it be?

00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:06.203 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- [Simon] So in a room 
full of people,

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:09.206 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I finally got to ask why
he’d stopped all the contact.

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:11.208 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- I've written eight
chapters of the next book

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:13.419 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
for the last four months.

00:45:13.419 --> 00:45:16.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I just had two performances of
Elijah,

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:20.843 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of the professional choral
group that I sing with.

00:45:20.843 --> 00:45:24.096 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We’re redesigning the museum in
Roswell,

00:45:24.096 --> 00:45:26.599 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
because I’m an advisor to the
board,

00:45:26.599 --> 00:45:29.352 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I’m totally involved
in all we're redoing --

00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:32.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Simon] And that, seemingly,
was that.

00:45:34.273 --> 00:45:35.650 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Was there anything you
think you could have done

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:37.985 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
differently, or you feel --

00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:39.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
- What else?

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:40.571 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Bring the body.

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:42.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
(laughs)

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.742 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
What else can you do?

00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:45.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
Tell me?

00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:49.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
If they say its a mummy,
where is the picture,

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.623 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
where is the mummy?

00:45:50.623 --> 00:45:53.668 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
If they say anything, they
have to prove it my friend.

00:45:53.668 --> 00:45:56.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I think it was very solid,
very well supported.

00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:58.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
That is all I can say.

00:45:59.632 --> 00:46:01.092 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- [Simon] I couldn’t argue with
him.

00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:04.303 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Whatever people felt about it,
Jaime Maussan had just put on

00:46:04.303 --> 00:46:07.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the biggest show in UFO history.

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:21.153 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I'd gone as far as I could go
in Mexico, and with Roswell.

00:46:21.153 --> 00:46:25.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Being amongst the UFO scene is
like living inside a bubble,

00:46:25.324 --> 00:46:27.994 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and bubbles always burst.

00:46:27.994 --> 00:46:28.828 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
- [Radio Announcer] 
A group called

00:46:28.828 --> 00:46:30.871 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the Roswell Slides Research
Group,

00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:34.458 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
had used a de-blurring
process to look at the placard

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:36.502 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that was visible in the
slides and within hours

00:46:36.502 --> 00:46:39.547 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
they were able to decode
it, to de-blur it,

00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:41.882 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and were able to read it
well enough to realize that

00:46:41.882 --> 00:46:42.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
what we had was --

00:46:42.883 --> 00:46:44.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Simon] Schmitt had told me
that the long wait had been so

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:46.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
they could perform due diligence
analyzing

00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:50.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the slides, but members of the
public had made more progress

00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:54.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in one day than their scientists
had made in three years.

00:46:54.687 --> 00:46:58.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And the online UFO community
were out for blood.

00:46:58.566 --> 00:47:01.235 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
- [Chris] It was just a
matter of hours before

00:47:01.235 --> 00:47:02.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
some of the very clever people
in

00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:04.488 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the Roswell Slides Research
Group

00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:06.574 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
who had access to some
sophisticated software,

00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:08.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and when I say sophisticated
I mean software

00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:13.706 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that’s available for most
personal home computers,

00:47:13.706 --> 00:47:16.751 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
they were able to de-blur the
writing

00:47:16.751 --> 00:47:19.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
on the slides almost
immediately.

00:47:19.378 --> 00:47:24.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- We managed to acquire a
copy of a high quality image

00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:25.926 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
of the placard.

00:47:25.926 --> 00:47:27.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And that’s when things started
rolling,

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:30.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
one of our members named Nab
Lator,

00:47:30.139 --> 00:47:32.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
I remember him showing a picture

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:35.936 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and it sort of said, "something
of two".

00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:38.272 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
At that point I said,

00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:39.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
"Really?

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:41.984 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
"These are words, we’re
actually seeing words

00:47:41.984 --> 00:47:44.111 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
"on this placard when
other people had said

00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:46.363 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
"they couldn’t find anything.

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:49.950 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Within a couple of hours,
we had come up with

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:53.120 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
"Mummified body of two year old
boy."

00:47:56.415 --> 00:47:59.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- [Simon] Whatever secrets
the US Government has on UFOs,

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.630 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
events like these surely serve
to keep the ridicule factor

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:04.381 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
as high as it can go.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.803 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
- Tom Carey and Don Schmitt,
who I was working with

00:48:08.803 --> 00:48:12.056 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
at the time, mentioned
nothing to me about this.

00:48:12.056 --> 00:48:13.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
They never said a word about it.

00:48:13.265 --> 00:48:16.018 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
I don’t know why I was cut out,

00:48:16.018 --> 00:48:18.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
other than they may have
thought I’d have been

00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:20.606 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
overly skeptical 
about the slides

00:48:20.606 --> 00:48:23.150 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
showing an 
alien creature.

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:25.194 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- [Simon] Not long after,
even more paperwork

00:48:25.194 --> 00:48:28.030 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and a second picture surfaced
which seemed to bury the case

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
for the slides once and for all.

00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:33.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Adam Dew had gone to
ground, presumably richer,

00:48:33.661 --> 00:48:36.205 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and Schmitt had started to make
a U-turn.

00:48:36.205 --> 00:48:39.667 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Once again, they’d left Maussan
to face the music alone.

00:48:39.667 --> 00:48:44.463 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
- It's not the same size,
it's not the same length.

00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:47.883 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
One is 29 inches, the other is
47 inches.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.428 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's a big difference, I’m
sorry.

00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:54.223 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I want you to look at the new
picture,

00:48:54.223 --> 00:48:57.309 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and the old picture and
tell me where is the hands,

00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:59.478 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
where is the hands?

00:48:59.478 --> 00:49:03.065 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There are so many people saying
that I did it for the money,

00:49:03.065 --> 00:49:05.484 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
without any proof, any proof.

00:49:06.318 --> 00:49:07.695 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
They don’t know how much I won,

00:49:07.695 --> 00:49:09.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
they don’t know how much I lost,

00:49:09.405 --> 00:49:12.616 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
they don't know anything,
but they talk and talk.

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:17.246 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I can tell you Simon, that
I lost money in this event.

00:49:17.246 --> 00:49:18.080 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
Period.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.459 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I can prove it to anyone
who has a good reason to know.

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I am tired of the personal
attacks.

00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:25.880 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
I’m not a criminal.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:29.967 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I am really an honest,
and I have integrity --

00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:31.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
- [Simon] I never did meet
a cosmic whistleblower

00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:34.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
with definitive proof on UFOs.

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:38.017 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When it comes to Roswell,
maybe all we can do after all

00:49:38.017 --> 00:49:41.604 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
is listen to those people
who were closest to it.

00:49:41.604 --> 00:49:45.774 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- My personal belief is that
there was a craft that crashed

00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:49.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
out there that was not from this
world.

00:49:50.362 --> 00:49:53.240 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- Look how many years its
been since it all took place.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.119 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I mean, there's a lot changed
in this world in that time.

00:49:57.119 --> 00:50:01.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We’ve learned that space
travel is possible,

00:50:01.457 --> 00:50:04.001 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and we are doing it now,
why couldn’t it been done

00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:07.379 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
from another universe many years
before?

00:50:09.757 --> 00:50:11.300 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- [Simon] I'm still no
nearer to finding the truth

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
about UFOs, but we all deserve
to know it.

00:50:14.887 --> 00:50:16.889 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Whatever that truth is.

00:50:20.226 --> 00:50:23.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
- [Richard] I do think its
important for all of the people,

00:50:23.187 --> 00:50:24.813 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and this includes myself,

00:50:24.813 --> 00:50:27.107 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
who were involved in
the Mexico City event,

00:50:27.107 --> 00:50:30.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
simply to admit the
slides show a child mummy.

00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:34.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
That means Jaime, that means
Don, that means Tom Carey,

00:50:34.406 --> 00:50:36.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
that means Adam Dew.

00:50:36.909 --> 00:50:39.912 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- UFOlogy has been damaged
by the Roswell slides case,

00:50:39.912 --> 00:50:43.749 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but the slides are a symptom,
you know?

00:50:43.749 --> 00:50:47.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It was bad research and I
think there’s a lot of it.

00:50:47.002 --> 00:50:50.631 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
- The placard says that it is a
mummy,

00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:52.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
then one has to accept that.

00:50:52.591 --> 00:50:56.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
That was the point of my
apology.

00:50:56.136 --> 00:50:59.139 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
- I am hurt by Don Schmitt,
because of what he did.

00:50:59.139 --> 00:51:00.766 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
No question about that.

00:51:00.766 --> 00:51:04.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He said he was threatened,
that they wanted sue him.

00:51:04.603 --> 00:51:08.857 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- There was some legal
situation regarding the use of

00:51:08.857 --> 00:51:12.319 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the name of the particular
individual,

00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:16.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
who served to analyse the
slides, and that’s all I’ll say.

00:51:17.992 --> 00:51:20.744 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- I think we need transparency
and we need to talk about

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:24.748 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
what’s going on in UFOlogy to
elevate it,

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:29.211 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to the level of what you would
be doing in a real science.

00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:31.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
- Would you think that anybody
who says,

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:34.216 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
"I have an extraterrestrial
body"

00:51:34.216 --> 00:51:36.260 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
is going to get away with it?

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Do you think that it's
going to be accepted?

00:51:38.512 --> 00:51:39.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Would you do it?

00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:45.311 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
- If our failing is anything,
it's that we relied too much

00:51:45.311 --> 00:51:47.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
on the scientific communities,

00:51:47.354 --> 00:51:51.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and science as we know
is far from absolute.
