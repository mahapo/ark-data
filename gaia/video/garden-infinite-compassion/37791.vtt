00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:18.183
<v Voiceover>What is a contemplative garden?</v>

3
00:00:19.303 --> 00:00:21.116
A contemplative garden is a place

4
00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:23.396
that allows contemplative mind.

5
00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:28.018
Therefore, it allows for a certain quietness.

6
00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:30.247
It's marked by quietness.

7
00:00:30.247 --> 00:00:34.262
It's marked by balance and harmony.

8
00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:36.054
So it's a place in which

9
00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:40.174
your spirit settles and quiets

10
00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:43.808
so you can contact your true self.

11
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.282 line:15% 
One evening in early August 2005,

12
00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:51.020 line:15% 
I was working in my studio

13
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.614
when my wife Alex came in and said,

14
00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:55.785
"There's a woman on the telephone"

15
00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:57.817
"who has a design emergency."

16
00:00:58.707 --> 00:01:01.374
I said, "Well, my goodness, in all of my years"

17
00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:02.649
"I've never heard of such thing"

18
00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.392
"as a garden design emergency,"

19
00:01:04.392 --> 00:01:07.236
but I went to the telephone and it was Anita Northwood

20
00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:09.144
from the Sawtooth Botanical Gardens

21
00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:12.039
in Ketchum in Sun Valley, Idaho.

22
00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.244
She said, "I have a design emergency."

23
00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:18.171
I said, "What's the nature of your emergency, madam?"

24
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:21.486
She said, "His Holiness, the Dalai Lama"

25
00:01:21.486 --> 00:01:25.215
"is coming in September 11th"

26
00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:28.685
"to speak to Sun Valley, Idaho,"

27
00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:31.793
"and with him he's bringing a prayer wheel."

28
00:01:31.793 --> 00:01:34.285
"It's said to be the most beautiful prayer wheel ever made,"

29
00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:37.023
"and it has to be turned by water."

30
00:01:37.023 --> 00:01:40.612
"We've been selected as the site to create a garden"

31
00:01:40.612 --> 00:01:42.603
"to house this prayer wheel."

32
00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:46.968 line:15% 
<v ->Originally, I think it was kind of a moving target.</v>

33
00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:49.048 line:15% 
We really didn't know what we were doing.

34
00:01:49.048 --> 00:01:50.764
They told us of the prayer wheel.

35
00:01:50.764 --> 00:01:52.278
I didn't really know what it looked like.

36
00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:55.505
No one did at that point, so the size has been up and down,

37
00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:59.774
and we kind of decided, well the prayer wheel

38
00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:02.636
needs to be in a spot that's conducive

39
00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:05.988
to harmony and peace and quiet.

40
00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:09.663
We're not really always the quietest place

41
00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:13.749
because we are next to a large public transit area.

42
00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.419
So what we've done is we have decided--

43
00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.934
Martin has decided to build this garden

44
00:02:21.994 --> 00:02:26.029
in an effort to bring tranquility to that particular spot.

45
00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.531
(tranquil flute music)

46
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:42.527
<v ->We had six feet of earth to hold up</v>

47
00:02:42.527 --> 00:02:44.823
because we dug a six foot hole.

48
00:02:44.823 --> 00:02:49.744
So to retain six feet of soil

49
00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:54.784
on all sides of this garden in a short time,

50
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:58.906
rocks were an ideal medium to use.

51
00:02:59.776 --> 00:03:03.279
Rock is speaking of earth itself.

52
00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.047
It's the basic guts

53
00:03:06.047 --> 00:03:10.332
and essence of the earth element.

54
00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:12.542
That's a nice stone.

55
00:03:13.252 --> 00:03:15.629
That's prettiest stone I've ever accrued.

56
00:03:16.543 --> 00:03:19.877
I picked up 16 stones because the theme

57
00:03:19.877 --> 00:03:22.479
of the 16 Arhats is the traditional theme

58
00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.772
in classical Japanese gardens.

59
00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:29.362
The 16 Arhats were the original students

60
00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:32.293
of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni.

61
00:03:33.483 --> 00:03:35.978
They are said to have attained enlightenment

62
00:03:35.978 --> 00:03:39.639
in their own lifetime and so they serve as protectors.

63
00:03:40.468 --> 00:03:43.532
So having 16 stones in the garden

64
00:03:43.532 --> 00:03:46.943
protects the truth in that garden,

65
00:03:46.943 --> 00:03:51.638
allows you to experience true innocence

66
00:03:51.638 --> 00:03:54.533
and open-heartedness when you are

67
00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.875
in the presence of the prayer wheel.

68
00:04:21.464 --> 00:04:26.259
(tranquil flute music)

69
00:04:33.254 --> 00:04:35.186 line:15% 
<v ->The first thing that caught my attention</v>

70
00:04:35.186 --> 00:04:37.399 line:15% 
were these boulders he was gonna be

71
00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:39.045 line:15% 
bringing in from Montana,

72
00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:41.036
from a quarry in Montana.

73
00:04:41.036 --> 00:04:43.493
These huge, beautiful rocks

74
00:04:43.493 --> 00:04:45.838
and the whole concept of these 16 rocks.

75
00:04:46.968 --> 00:04:48.920
My husband and I have spent so much of our lives

76
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.438
in the mountains and rocks for us are just,

77
00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:54.303
they are so solid and serene,

78
00:04:54.303 --> 00:04:57.753
and yet there's some sort of spirit inside the rocks.

79
00:04:57.753 --> 00:05:00.278
When he mentioned those rocks and I saw them

80
00:05:00.278 --> 00:05:01.903
placed in the garden, I thought oh my,

81
00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:04.114
now this is something I really,

82
00:05:04.114 --> 00:05:06.541
this has a connection here.

83
00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:13.222 line:15% 
<v ->Obviously the rocks are, for me,</v>

84
00:05:13.222 --> 00:05:14.691 line:15% 
one of the most exciting things.

85
00:05:14.691 --> 00:05:16.733
The size, the magnitude,

86
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.507
how long it takes to place them,

87
00:05:18.507 --> 00:05:20.643
the art of placing them.

88
00:05:20.643 --> 00:05:23.055
It's really neat watching Martin

89
00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:27.071
go through this whole process.

90
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:35.672
<v ->Each stone has it's own particular energy.</v>

91
00:05:36.992 --> 00:05:40.082
You feel it especially when you touch the stone.

92
00:05:41.232 --> 00:05:44.056
There's something that comes from the stone.

93
00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:48.014
It's almost like touching an animal or a human.

94
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.002
You feel a spiritual

95
00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:57.505
energy or quality that relates you to the stone.

96
00:05:57.505 --> 00:05:59.556
You can feel that stone in you,

97
00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:01.683
as though you are that stone.

98
00:06:11.993 --> 00:06:14.579
In the model, you can organize your stones

99
00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:16.773
as you want them to be, but in reality,

100
00:06:16.773 --> 00:06:19.026
once you get the actual stone there,

101
00:06:19.026 --> 00:06:21.282
it goes as it wants to be.

102
00:06:22.502 --> 00:06:24.048
So when you set the first stone,

103
00:06:24.048 --> 00:06:26.265
since all other stones relate to it,

104
00:06:26.265 --> 00:06:28.265
since it goes the way it wants to go,

105
00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:30.362
you have to be very open-minded

106
00:06:30.362 --> 00:06:33.557
to creating the relationship

107
00:06:34.197 --> 00:06:36.951
that really belongs within the character

108
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:40.018
of the stones that you've selected.

109
00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:41.667
So you're not imposing your own

110
00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.754
mental process on the stones.

111
00:06:43.754 --> 00:06:46.314
You're working together with the stones,

112
00:06:46.314 --> 00:06:49.312
like a band almost, a team,

113
00:06:49.312 --> 00:06:52.555
to create the most beautiful organization

114
00:06:52.555 --> 00:06:56.616
that those stones can have inherently.

115
00:06:58.436 --> 00:07:00.501
The hill makes me feel a little bit better.

116
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:01.653
<v Voiceover>Makes it stronger.</v>

117
00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:02.905
<v ->Yeah, you know.</v>

118
00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:06.513
The first stone really does represent this quality

119
00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:10.902
of the teacher, the mountain, the incarnation

120
00:07:10.902 --> 00:07:15.190
of some kind of divine energy.

121
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.741
The other stones then relate to that central quality

122
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:25.014
by gesturing toward it or pulling away from it,

123
00:07:25.014 --> 00:07:28.023
or creating a basis that holds it.

124
00:07:29.793 --> 00:07:32.201
You have to be open to the spontaneity

125
00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:34.779
of where the rock wants to be,

126
00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:37.341
and who it wants to be with.

127
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:44.464
(tranquil flute music)

128
00:07:51.344 --> 00:07:52.990
<v ->We knew the prayer wheel,</v>

129
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.359
when it was going to be put here,

130
00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:57.506
they wanted it to be turned by water,

131
00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:00.772
and that was a challenge for us, knowing that.

132
00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:02.717
<v ->We didn't know what force of water</v>

133
00:08:02.717 --> 00:08:05.315
we would need to turn the prayer wheel,

134
00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:09.805
but I couldn't make wheelchair access happen

135
00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:13.167
by dropping the pathway more than five feet,

136
00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:15.623
so I dropped the water six feet.

137
00:08:17.013 --> 00:08:18.855
I figured with six foot of fall,

138
00:08:18.855 --> 00:08:20.529
I could turn most anything.

139
00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:22.986
It would design the mechanism

140
00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:24.708
to turn the prayer wheel properly.

141
00:08:24.708 --> 00:08:27.048
So the water entrance is from the north,

142
00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:30.589
and then goes behind this large stone

143
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:34.268
which is the fundamental stone protecting the north,

144
00:08:34.718 --> 00:08:37.014
and then begins to cascade.

145
00:08:37.014 --> 00:08:41.009
The quality and the feeling of the waterfall,

146
00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:46.459
it's what really invites the presence

147
00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.761
of certain kind of deities to come.

148
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:53.479
(tranquil flute music)

149
00:09:04.006 --> 00:09:07.723
I wanted to get kind of a yin and yang,

150
00:09:07.723 --> 00:09:10.863
an opposition of the qualities of water.

151
00:09:10.863 --> 00:09:14.246
One bright and moving and vibrant,

152
00:09:14.246 --> 00:09:18.849
and the other quiet, serene, reflective, and clear.

153
00:09:19.524 --> 00:09:24.241
(chanting in foreign language)

154
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.137
Water has this wonderful ability where

155
00:09:36.137 --> 00:09:38.780
the top of it can reflect the stone above it,

156
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.739
and the sky can come down into the ground,

157
00:09:42.739 --> 00:09:46.222
and the clouds can be swirling around.

158
00:09:46.222 --> 00:09:48.444
At the same time, you can see

159
00:09:48.444 --> 00:09:51.865
the stone beneath the wave pattern.

160
00:09:51.865 --> 00:09:54.414
If there are fish in it, fish in the mid level.

161
00:09:54.414 --> 00:09:57.543
So water is a lot like the nature of mind.

162
00:10:01.743 --> 00:10:05.441
The contemplative mind is, in many ways,

163
00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:08.749
a purification of ordinary mind.

164
00:10:08.749 --> 00:10:10.876
It is ordinary mind,

165
00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:15.136
minus all of the distracting thoughts

166
00:10:16.996 --> 00:10:21.342
coming from conflicting emotions and thought patterns.

167
00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:25.700
When the mind becomes balanced and harmonious,

168
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.254
the contemplative mind happens,

169
00:10:28.254 --> 00:10:31.794
and that's a purified state of mind,

170
00:10:31.794 --> 00:10:33.737
a pure existence of mind.

171
00:10:33.737 --> 00:10:38.437
Water is what evokes that condition of mind.

172
00:10:41.513 --> 00:10:46.251
(tranquil flute music)

173
00:11:00.467 --> 00:11:03.249
<v ->Our message is basically to live in harmony with plants</v>

174
00:11:03.249 --> 00:11:07.774
and the landscape and to use that

175
00:11:07.774 --> 00:11:10.547
in your life without changing it.

176
00:11:10.547 --> 00:11:14.813
<v ->A garden doesn't happen until water and stone</v>

177
00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:19.138
combines in balance in proportion with plants.

178
00:11:20.288 --> 00:11:23.609
<v Voiceover>Look at that water rise, wow!</v>

179
00:11:33.232 --> 00:11:36.819
<v ->The shrubs were done in groupings of threes and fives,</v>

180
00:11:36.819 --> 00:11:41.185
and give a rhythm and a progression

181
00:11:41.185 --> 00:11:43.831
to your experience of the garden.

182
00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:45.447
They also establish the basic

183
00:11:45.447 --> 00:11:48.620
structural unity of the garden.

184
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.543
Have you watched a daisy in the morning coming up,

185
00:11:52.543 --> 00:11:54.764
and then watching this,

186
00:11:54.764 --> 00:11:57.647
and then at night bowing its head?

187
00:11:58.467 --> 00:12:01.094
Truly the plant kingdom

188
00:12:01.094 --> 00:12:04.198
is all about the sun.

189
00:12:04.707 --> 00:12:06.788
Plant design is a lot like music,

190
00:12:06.788 --> 00:12:08.786
composition of music.

191
00:12:08.786 --> 00:12:12.016
It exists in the experience

192
00:12:12.016 --> 00:12:14.649
of time and has pattern.

193
00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:17.503
In the upper grove where the thousand people

194
00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:19.971
we talked about wait in benches,

195
00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:24.509
we planted I think 30 aspens.

196
00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:27.000
The aspen trunk, the whiteness of it

197
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.433
feels so alive, so fragile somehow.

198
00:12:32.743 --> 00:12:37.425
(tranquil flute music)

199
00:12:40.418 --> 00:12:45.282
(speaking spanish)

200
00:12:53.042 --> 00:12:57.019
The most important parts

201
00:12:57.019 --> 00:13:00.685
of the prayer wheel itself

202
00:13:00.685 --> 00:13:03.979
is as you come out of the prayer wheel,

203
00:13:03.979 --> 00:13:07.018
and you've had this experience with the prayer wheel,

204
00:13:07.018 --> 00:13:10.250
which is an extraordinary and very special experience,

205
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.903
what do you see?

206
00:13:13.273 --> 00:13:15.164
What you see as you come out of there

207
00:13:15.164 --> 00:13:17.646
is a grouping of five rocks,

208
00:13:18.296 --> 00:13:21.037
and those five rocks have this tree

209
00:13:21.037 --> 00:13:25.006
that just winds around them

210
00:13:25.006 --> 00:13:27.754
and solutes them and becomes

211
00:13:27.754 --> 00:13:31.260
a brother-sister relationship to the rock.

212
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.766
So we take the absolute element of the rock,

213
00:13:34.766 --> 00:13:37.492
the hardness, the unchangeability,

214
00:13:37.492 --> 00:13:40.679
and we interweave it in a very, very intimate way.

215
00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:44.498
This thing that's constantly changing and fragile.

216
00:13:44.498 --> 00:13:49.282
The aspects of plant design is the experience

217
00:13:49.282 --> 00:13:52.080
of the eye as it moves through the garden.

218
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.503
So you take a step and you turn a little bit,

219
00:13:54.503 --> 00:13:55.804
what do you see?

220
00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:57.196
Every time you take a step,

221
00:13:57.196 --> 00:13:58.938
you do want to create a little picture.

222
00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:03.120
That picture might feature a little violet blooming,

223
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.096
or it might be a tree, it might be a rock,

224
00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.281
it might be the fall of the water,

225
00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:12.788
but each step creates a new perfect composition.

226
00:14:13.488 --> 00:14:17.951
(tranquil flute music)

227
00:14:30.383 --> 00:14:33.065
I think of the pathway as representing the air element.

228
00:14:33.065 --> 00:14:35.515
The air element is the movement of energy

229
00:14:35.515 --> 00:14:38.348
through the system of the garden.

230
00:14:38.348 --> 00:14:43.002
So it's like the veins of the garden,

231
00:14:43.002 --> 00:14:45.125
or the neurological system of the garden.

232
00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:46.687
It's the way you move through it

233
00:14:46.687 --> 00:14:48.639
and that which connects all things.

234
00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:51.510 line:15% 
<v ->She said, "Grandma, let's go down this trail over there,"</v>

235
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.899 line:15% 
and it was just a dusty trail out through the sage brush.

236
00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:59.164
I said, "Sarah, why do you want to go down that path?"

237
00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:02.419
She said, "Grandma, I want to go down that path"

238
00:15:02.419 --> 00:15:05.004
"because I don't know where it leads."

239
00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:07.494
<v ->Part of the design of a pathway</v>

240
00:15:07.494 --> 00:15:08.833
in the contemplative garden

241
00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:11.261
has to do with the journey through the garden.

242
00:15:11.261 --> 00:15:14.388
So you're thinking every step, what am I seeing?

243
00:15:14.388 --> 00:15:18.590
Also, what does your body feel like as you're turning?

244
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.839
Is it a jerky turn or is it a smooth and gentle turn?

245
00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:28.305
So designing the pathway has to do with

246
00:15:28.305 --> 00:15:32.426
the way it flirts and separates from the river,

247
00:15:32.426 --> 00:15:36.319
and what you're seeing every step as you're going along.

248
00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:38.046
When you first step into the garden,

249
00:15:38.046 --> 00:15:40.490
you're very much aware of the surroundings

250
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.134
and the mountains around,

251
00:15:42.134 --> 00:15:44.902
but as you go down to the garden,

252
00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:48.140
first you notice the big sister rocks.

253
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.871
That's kind of the threshold that you pass

254
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:54.584
on the journey to the prayer wheel.

255
00:15:54.584 --> 00:15:59.287
(tranquil flute music)

256
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.217
As you go up, you see in front of you

257
00:16:22.217 --> 00:16:26.361
after a few steps, a hint of the garden building,

258
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:29.262
and the activity ensues there.

259
00:16:29.262 --> 00:16:31.805
Then you begin to hear the sounds of the people

260
00:16:31.805 --> 00:16:34.502
who are waiting up in the upper area,

261
00:16:34.502 --> 00:16:37.049
and you reintegrate into

262
00:16:37.049 --> 00:16:40.464
the less private and more public world.

263
00:16:40.464 --> 00:16:43.680
<v ->I believe that there are a lot of different paths</v>

264
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.426
to find the spiritual center of your life.

265
00:16:46.426 --> 00:16:48.220
It doesn't matter which path you're on

266
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.396
because we're all headed in the same direction.

267
00:16:50.396 --> 00:16:55.257
(tranquil flute music)

268
00:17:02.502 --> 00:17:05.438
Having the prayer wheel will put us

269
00:17:05.438 --> 00:17:08.187
in touch with the wide world,

270
00:17:08.187 --> 00:17:11.065
that our rocks and our beautiful place

271
00:17:11.065 --> 00:17:13.326
will be blessed by having something

272
00:17:13.326 --> 00:17:14.876
that came from another continent,

273
00:17:14.876 --> 00:17:16.357
another part of the world.

274
00:17:16.357 --> 00:17:19.528
<v ->So what it's allowed us to do and if we grasp it,</v>

275
00:17:19.528 --> 00:17:22.545
is to get our message out there of what we're about

276
00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:25.582
as a community garden that we started at,

277
00:17:25.582 --> 00:17:28.478
which we evolved now into more of a botanical garden.

278
00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:32.327 line:15% 
<v ->What the prayer wheel means to me is</v>

279
00:17:33.457 --> 00:17:35.275 line:15% 
a fellowship in our community.

280
00:17:35.275 --> 00:17:37.932
<v ->I think there is a real source of strength</v>

281
00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:40.900
and blessing and healing power in prayer wheels.

282
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.621
<v ->The prayer wheel is almost exactly</v>

283
00:17:43.621 --> 00:17:45.534
in the middle of this garden.

284
00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:49.761
That's slightly different than I had in the model.

285
00:17:49.761 --> 00:17:53.378
The reason is because of the wheelchair access.

286
00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:02.490
(tranquil flute music)

287
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.781
<v Voiceover>They approximately were milled</v>

288
00:18:04.781 --> 00:18:07.025
out of the forest about 100 years ago.

289
00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:12.246
They were used for a grain silo.

290
00:18:12.246 --> 00:18:14.794
That was dismantled, torn apart,

291
00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:16.570
and then the beams were shipped down here,

292
00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.233
and then they were resawn.

293
00:18:18.233 --> 00:18:19.569
<v ->At the same time,</v>

294
00:18:20.209 --> 00:18:22.405
after about a week and half of the project,

295
00:18:22.405 --> 00:18:25.197
the woodworkers began the construction

296
00:18:25.197 --> 00:18:26.943
of the prayer wheel house.

297
00:18:26.943 --> 00:18:29.032
They decided to build this in the parking lot

298
00:18:29.032 --> 00:18:31.796
because there was just no way to get

299
00:18:31.796 --> 00:18:34.176
so many people down in this small area.

300
00:18:34.176 --> 00:18:36.573
They numbered each of the boards and built it,

301
00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:38.620
and then reassembled it down below.

302
00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.098 line:15% 
<v ->It's been an interesting evolution.</v>

303
00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:44.023 line:15% 
I can remember the very first evening,

304
00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:46.619
I was here with a couple board members,

305
00:18:47.229 --> 00:18:49.802
and some of the people from Big Wood

306
00:18:50.412 --> 00:18:53.144
looking over the area

307
00:18:53.144 --> 00:18:56.097
that we decided would be

308
00:18:56.097 --> 00:18:58.868
the proper place to put the prayer wheel.

309
00:18:59.988 --> 00:19:02.556
It was just so peaceful and beautiful

310
00:19:02.556 --> 00:19:07.242
with the mountains surrounding that space,

311
00:19:07.242 --> 00:19:09.774
and now it's been transformed

312
00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:13.034
into this very, very special,

313
00:19:14.407 --> 00:19:18.239
magical almost, space

314
00:19:18.239 --> 00:19:20.733
with incredible energy,

315
00:19:20.733 --> 00:19:22.752
but it looks like it's always been there.

316
00:19:22.752 --> 00:19:26.759
So it's interesting that

317
00:19:26.759 --> 00:19:29.479
Martin has designed this garden

318
00:19:29.479 --> 00:19:33.264
in such a way that it's so simple.

319
00:19:33.264 --> 00:19:35.859
I know it was complicated to put together,

320
00:19:35.859 --> 00:19:39.558
but the final product is beautiful and simple,

321
00:19:40.288 --> 00:19:42.582
and it's perfect.

322
00:19:43.568 --> 00:19:48.298
<v ->Prayer is opening yourself to something beyond yourself.</v>

323
00:19:48.748 --> 00:19:51.731
Listening as well as being thankful.

324
00:19:51.731 --> 00:19:55.562
<v ->Prayer, to me, is a type of meditation.</v>

325
00:19:56.512 --> 00:19:59.989
It's a way of going

326
00:19:59.989 --> 00:20:04.858
inside yourself and finding

327
00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:10.829
a one with the universe, with your God.

328
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.966
<v ->Quite often, prayer is</v>

329
00:20:15.449 --> 00:20:17.636
a request or an intention,

330
00:20:17.636 --> 00:20:20.037
or looking for something,

331
00:20:20.037 --> 00:20:21.567
and looking for a miracle,

332
00:20:21.567 --> 00:20:24.901
and wanting something profound.

333
00:20:25.431 --> 00:20:27.859
Meditation, for me, on the other hand,

334
00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:30.005
is getting out of my own way,

335
00:20:30.005 --> 00:20:33.426
and noticing and observing what's right there,

336
00:20:33.426 --> 00:20:35.484
and what's right in front of me.

337
00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:39.083
<v ->I think that we all put what are</v>

338
00:20:39.083 --> 00:20:41.877
our prayers or needs and this is irregardless

339
00:20:41.877 --> 00:20:44.518
of any religion or even religious belief.

340
00:20:44.518 --> 00:20:48.969
I think it gives us a place to put those feelings,

341
00:20:48.969 --> 00:20:51.803
and to feel them actually spinning off

342
00:20:51.803 --> 00:20:54.308
in this little field of energy.

343
00:21:00.258 --> 00:21:05.058
(tranquil flute music)

344
00:21:15.439 --> 00:21:16.901
<v Voiceover>As the Dalai Lama entered</v>

345
00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:19.504
this newly-constructed zen garden in Ketchum,

346
00:21:19.504 --> 00:21:21.740
he first passed by family members,

347
00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.494
his brother, niece, and nephew who flew in

348
00:21:24.494 --> 00:21:26.680
from Seattle to see his Holiness.

349
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.507
<v Voiceover>This project was like being under</v>

350
00:21:28.507 --> 00:21:31.213
the blessed umbrella of his Holiness, the Dalai Lama.

351
00:21:31.213 --> 00:21:36.154
All the relationships had a feeling of serendipity.

352
00:21:37.442 --> 00:21:40.642
Everyone involved was passionately involved.

353
00:21:43.032 --> 00:21:45.013
<v Voiceover>Inside this brightly-colored drum</v>

354
00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:46.954
are more than a million prayers.

355
00:21:46.954 --> 00:21:49.202
As a flowing stream spins it around,

356
00:21:49.202 --> 00:21:50.958
Buddhists believe those prayers

357
00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:53.049
are released into the universe.

358
00:21:53.049 --> 00:21:55.149
In his native tongue, the Dalai Lama

359
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:58.397
blessed this wheel by chanting a Tibetan mantra.

360
00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:03.314
<v ->When it's blessed by his Holiness,</v>

361
00:22:03.314 --> 00:22:06.275
it gives more meaning for us to go around it

362
00:22:06.275 --> 00:22:09.285
and try to pray for a more compassionate world.

363
00:22:09.285 --> 00:22:10.773
<v ->For me it was as though</v>

364
00:22:10.773 --> 00:22:12.789
a switch had been turned on.

365
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:15.324
There was this fabulously beautiful prayer wheel

366
00:22:15.324 --> 00:22:20.002
turning in the water and then he

367
00:22:20.532 --> 00:22:22.768
gave his blessing to the prayer wheel.

368
00:22:22.768 --> 00:22:24.626
It didn't take very long,

369
00:22:24.626 --> 00:22:26.896
but there was something

370
00:22:26.896 --> 00:22:29.418
that happened that was different.

371
00:22:30.228 --> 00:22:31.337
<v Voiceover>Right this way.</v>

372
00:22:31.337 --> 00:22:33.518
<v Voiceover>Whenever the Dalai Lama is in the US,</v>

373
00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:35.368
his family travels to see him

374
00:22:35.368 --> 00:22:37.445
and to expose the next generation

375
00:22:37.445 --> 00:22:41.033
to the spiritual and cultural ways of Buddhism.

376
00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:44.475 line:15% 
<v ->My first walk through here with Chris, my wife,</v>

377
00:22:44.475 --> 00:22:46.616 line:15% 
this afternoon and she had seen it before.

378
00:22:46.616 --> 00:22:48.381 line:15% 
Not today and everything like that.

379
00:22:48.381 --> 00:22:52.397
I stood over there at the reflecting pond and looked in.

380
00:22:53.307 --> 00:22:54.741
I'm almost embarrassed to admit,

381
00:22:54.741 --> 00:22:56.389
but I was welling up a little bit.

382
00:22:56.389 --> 00:23:01.242
(tranquil flute music)

383
00:23:22.543 --> 00:23:24.494 line:15% 
<v ->Well it really, although I had heard a lot about it,</v>

384
00:23:24.494 --> 00:23:26.950 line:15% 
it really, totally astonished me.

385
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:30.036 line:15% 
I had no idea it was so magical.

386
00:23:30.036 --> 00:23:32.334
The transition from the outside world

387
00:23:32.334 --> 00:23:37.021
into this place that doesn't have a place.

388
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:53.829 line:15% 
<v ->When I put my hand on the prayer wheel,</v>

389
00:23:54.749 --> 00:23:56.697 line:15% 
it felt like just a light energy,

390
00:23:56.697 --> 00:23:58.472
a lightness of being.

391
00:24:11.482 --> 00:24:12.803 line:15% 
<v ->It's gonna be a wonderful place</v>

392
00:24:14.213 --> 00:24:16.622 line:15% 
to come and contemplate and collect oneself,

393
00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:19.525 line:15% 
and share a moment of peace with nature.

394
00:24:24.515 --> 00:24:25.632 line:15% 
<v ->Walking around the prayer wheel,</v>

395
00:24:25.632 --> 00:24:27.407 line:15% 
with the hand on the prayer wheel,

396
00:24:27.407 --> 00:24:32.244 line:15% 
that those first change your interior world,

397
00:24:32.244 --> 00:24:36.020
and then they have a greater effect on the world around you,

398
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.556
whether it's just with your little family, your friends,

399
00:24:38.556 --> 00:24:42.744
and the ripples continue to go out from there.

400
00:24:45.064 --> 00:24:46.741
<v Voiceover>It's kind of exciting because I think</v>

401
00:24:46.741 --> 00:24:50.091
it will take the botanical garden to the next level.

402
00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:55.270
<v ->The success of the project depended upon</v>

403
00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.525
the complete level of responsibility

404
00:24:58.525 --> 00:25:00.298
and participation of everybody.

405
00:25:00.298 --> 00:25:03.475
We relied on eachother completely.

406
00:25:03.475 --> 00:25:05.526
As a result of that,

407
00:25:05.526 --> 00:25:09.230
we had a unique and wonderful experience,

408
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:11.932
and I think formed a bond and a friendship

409
00:25:11.932 --> 00:25:15.747
that will last through this lifetime and maybe the next.

410
00:25:17.217 --> 00:25:21.797
