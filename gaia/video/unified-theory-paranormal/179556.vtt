00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>> From demons and fairies
to UFOs and Bigfoot,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.060 align:middle line:84%
tales of the unexplained have
been a part of humanity's story

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.070 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Ancient alien theorists
will look at the Bible

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and chalk up every
bizarre event to aliens

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.000 align:middle line:84%
while a religious
scholar may look

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.770 align:middle line:84%
at contemporary alien encounters
as manifestations of demons.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoot and other cryptids have
a strange habit of showing up

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.200 align:middle line:90%
near UFO sightings.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And those who encounter
either of these phenomena

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
often discover newfound
psychic abilities.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Could there be a
common cause that

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:90%
explains all paranormal events?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the most famous
sustained paranormal experiences

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:90%
is the Mothman incident of 1966.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
For 13 months, Point
Pleasant, West Virginia

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:84%
was plagued with sightings
of a bizarre winged humanoid

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:84%
accompanied by mysterious
lights in the sky, animal

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:84%
mutilations, and other accounts
of paranormal activity.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Journalist John Keel
famously documented

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
this prolonged period of
unusual events in his book

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:84%
"The Mothman Prophecies,"
which was later made

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.120 align:middle line:90%
into a film of the same name.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
These simultaneous events
were not new to Keel.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:84%
He often wrote of window
areas, specific locations

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
on our planet where paranormal
events were far more likely

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:90%
and even expected to occur.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:84%
For experiencers and
believers of the paranormal,

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:84%
the greatest frustration
often lies in the lack

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:90%
of abundant physical evidence.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:84%
A few landing marks
here, a bit of fur

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
there, and even the
occasional photograph

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to be enough
to convince the skeptics.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:84%
After decades of
researching such cases,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Keel developed an
elegant hypothesis

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
which explains the
troublesome disparity

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.350 align:middle line:84%
between excessive testimony
and scarce physical evidence.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:84%
His book "The Eighth Tower,"
written at the same time

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:84%
as "The Mothman
Prophecies," proposes

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:84%
a sort of unified theory to
explain all paranormal events.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
These entities are able
to shift up and down

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic spectrum,
appearing and disappearing

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:90%
as they please.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.280 align:middle line:10%
Keel called this
the superspectrum

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:10%
And he referred to the
beings inhabiting it

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:10%
as ultraterrestrials.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:10%
This could explain the variety
of electromagnetic effects

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:10%
often associated with
paranormal events.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Cars stall, widespread
power outages

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:84%
occur, radios and
telephones go crazy,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and battery operated
devices refuse to work.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Clocks and watches
have also been

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
known to stop in the presence
of UFOs, monsters, and ghosts.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Keel believes these beings
are native to the earth, which

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:84%
explains their manifestation
in different forms

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
ages, but that they

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
inhabit physical dimensions
beyond normal human perception.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:84%
This theory fits with
scientific understandings

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:84%
of how our brains perceive
the world around us.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.280 align:middle line:84%
It is well known that our
senses are only equipped

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.460 align:middle line:84%
to pick up a very small
slice of physical activity.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Dogs, cats, and other animals
are able to hear audio

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:90%
frequencies we cannot.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Is it simply
coincidence that they

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
seem to have a sixth
sense for the paranormal?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:10%
Pet psychologist
Marti Miller has

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:10%
said, "sensing the supernatural
is natural for dogs,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:10%
because they don't judge it.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.800 align:middle line:10%
People could see
auras or spirits,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:10%
but they either don't
believe they exist,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:10%
or think that, if they do
exist, we could not see them."

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, our sensory
organs are constantly

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.704 align:middle line:84%
capturing far more information
than our brains can process.

00:03:35.704 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
critical functions

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:84%
of the brain's sensory response
is filtering out information

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:90%
that it deems unnecessary.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Pattern recognition plays a
large role in this process.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
When you see something
that looks like a tree,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
your brain acknowledges
the general shape of a tree

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and quickly creates
the idea of a tree.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when you
observe something that

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:90%
fits no recognized pattern?

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.220 align:middle line:84%
"What we pay attention
to is largely

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:84%
determined by our expectations
of what should be present,"

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.910 align:middle line:84%
said Christopher Chabris,
a cognitive psychologist,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:84%
in an interview with
the "New York Times."

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:84%
"Without expecting
something, we're

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
unlikely to pay attention
to it," he says.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:84%
"And when we are not paying
attention to something,

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:84%
we are surprisingly
likely to not see it."

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
This could also explain
the common motif described

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
by Keel and many
other researchers

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:84%
that when you start
studying these phenomena,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:84%
they begin to reflect back,
occurring with more regularity

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.510 align:middle line:84%
and even responding
to your thoughts.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
It seems that once your
brain recognizes these beings

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and begins paying
attention to them,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:84%
your odds of glimpsing
them improve.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, writer
Gustav Davidson

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
was compiling a massive book
of historical accounts called

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:90%
"Dictionary of Angels."

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Davidson had never had a
paranormal experience before.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:10%
But during his writing, he was
literally bedeviled by angels.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Participants in the
growing CE-5 movement

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:84%
go one step further,
intentionally working

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:90%
to summon this sort of contact.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.220 align:middle line:84%
A close encounter
of the fifth kind

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
refers to an experience
in which someone interacts

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:84%
in a purposeful way with
an unidentified flying

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:90%
object or its inhabitants.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:10%
Some ufologists, most
notably Dr. Steven Greer,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:10%
have developed protocols
for intentionally initiating

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:10%
contact, believing that a
focused meditation can promote

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:10%
interaction with nearby beings.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Practitioners claim a
surprising level of success

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:84%
with these protocols, producing
all manner of documentation

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
showing strange lights
and other manifestations

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.280 align:middle line:90%
during CE-5 meditations.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
we are constantly

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by these
ultraterrestrials

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and our focused
attention is all that

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.200 align:middle line:90%
is necessary to perceive them?

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there
is the possibility

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:84%
that the existence of paranormal
entities throughout history

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.620 align:middle line:84%
could be chalked
up to Jung's theory

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:84%
of the collective
unconscious revealing itself

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
through vividly
overactive imaginations,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:84%
or could we be living
on a densely populated,

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional
planet alongside beings

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:84%
who have interacted with
us for centuries, leaving

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
little trace within our own
narrow perception of reality?

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:25.451 align:middle line:90%
