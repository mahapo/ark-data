with his humanness.

But he was not
physically imposing.

00:24:46.295 --> 00:24:51.050 align:middle line:84%
He spoke neither
softly, nor loud.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.170 align:middle line:90%
He didn't speak a lot.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:90%
He wanted others to talk more.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:90%
He asked me sort of my story.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I remember because I--
god, I want to the talk.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.170 align:middle line:90%
But he kept asking me questions.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said, like, I don't get
around young people very often.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.384 align:middle line:84%
I've read his poetry, and a
prolific writer and thinker.

00:25:11.384 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know he had listening
skills, particularly.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.840 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't what
I was expecting.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:10%
Because he was pretty informal,
again, in a setting where

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:10%
some folks were very formal.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>The attendees
presented papers,

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:34.120 align:middle line:84%
thoughtful, prayerful,
insightful, in-depth.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.920 align:middle line:10%
But in more informal
remarks, Merton

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:10%
offered a sense of a monk,
what a monk is or could be,

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.190 align:middle line:10%
and how that relates
to the rest the world.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>The question that people have
been asking to a great extent,

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:90%
who do you represent?

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:90%
What religion do you represent?

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is a rather
difficult question to answer.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I came with the notion
of perhaps saying

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
something for monks and to monks
of all religions, because I'm

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.310 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be a monk.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And therefore
speaking for monks,

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I am really speaking
for a very strange kind

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.220 align:middle line:90%
of person, a marginal person.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:84%
He does not belong
to an establishment.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:84%
He is a marginal person
who withdraws deliberately

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.370 align:middle line:84%
to the margin of society,
with a view of deepening

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:90%
fundamental human experience.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, as one of
these strange people,

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I speak to you as
a representative

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:84%
of all marginal persons who
have done this kind of thing

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:90%
deliberately.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.910 align:middle line:84%
The office of the monk,
or the marginal people,

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
or the meditative
person, or the poet,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
is to go beyond death,
even in this life.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.560 align:middle line:84%
To go beyond the dichotomy
of life and death,

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and therefore be
a witness to life.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:90%
This requires, of course, faith.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:84%
But soon as you
say faith in terms

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:84%
of this monastic and
marginal existence,

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.570 align:middle line:90%
you run into another problem.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.595 align:middle line:90%
Faith means doubt.

00:27:00.595 --> 00:27:02.843 align:middle line:84%
Faith is not the
suppression of doubt.

00:27:02.843 --> 00:27:05.350 align:middle line:90%
It is the overcoming of doubt.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And you overcome doubt
by going through it.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:84%
A man of faith, who has
never experienced doubt,

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.540 align:middle line:90%
is not a man of faith.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.720 align:middle line:10%
Consequently, the
monk is one who

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.280 align:middle line:10%
has to struggle in the
depths of his being

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:10%
with the presence
of doubt and to go

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:10%
through what some religions
call the Great Doubt.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:10%
I stand among you as one who a
offers a small message of hope,

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:10%
that first there
are always people

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:10%
who dare to seek on the
margin of society, who are not

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.950 align:middle line:10%
dependent on social
acceptance, not

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.410 align:middle line:10%
dependent on social
routines, and prefer

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:45.090 align:middle line:10%
a kind of free-floating
existence under a state a risk.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.740 align:middle line:10%
And among these people,
if they are faithful

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.670 align:middle line:10%
to their own calling, and
faithful to their own vocation,

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.480 align:middle line:10%
and faithful to their
own message from God,

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.140 align:middle line:10%
communication on the
deepest level is possible.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And the deepest level
of communication

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.610 align:middle line:84%
is not communication,
but communion.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.456 align:middle line:90%
It is wordless.

00:28:03.456 --> 00:28:05.320 align:middle line:90%
It is beyond words.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.820 align:middle line:90%
And it is beyond speech.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.585 align:middle line:90%
And it is beyond concept.

00:28:09.585 --> 00:28:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Not that we discover
a new unity.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:90%

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.990 align:middle line:84%
My dear brothers and
sisters, we are already one.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.050 align:middle line:90%
But we imagine that we are not.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to recover
is our original unity.

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:84%
What we have to
be is what we are.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:90%

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Polonnaruwa, with its
vast area under trees,

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:11.083 align:middle line:84%
fences, few people, no
beggars, a dirt road, lost.

extraordinary faces.

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Looking at these
figures, I'm suddenly,

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:45.337 align:middle line:84%
almost forcibly,
jerked clean out

00:42:45.337 --> 00:42:48.870 align:middle line:84%
of the habitual half-tied
vision of things.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And an inner clearness,
clarity, as if

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.640 align:middle line:84%
exploding from the
rocks themselves,

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.430 align:middle line:90%
became evident and obvious.

Everything is emptiness.

And everything is compassion.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when
in my life I have

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:08.060 align:middle line:84%
had such a sense of beauty
and spiritual validity running

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:13.150 align:middle line:84%
together in one
aesthetic illumination.

Surely, my Asian
pilgrimage has become clear

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:18.220 align:middle line:90%

I don't know what else remains.

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.930 align:middle line:84%

pierced through the surface

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and have got beyond the
shadow and the disguise.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:36.010 align:middle line:84%
This is Asia in its purity,
not covered with garbage.

It says everything.

is paradoxical often silent.

fact more real, to a mystic,

They're most acutely aware
of the mystery of what

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:13.470 align:middle line:90%
it means to be human being.

>>And when one takes that in,
with eyes, and mind, and heart,

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:20.420 align:middle line:90%
it is enormously impressive.

boundary-less free-fall, just

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:31.020 align:middle line:90%
boundary-less free-fall.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>So for Merton, I
think he had several

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.190 align:middle line:84%
of these transformational
experiences.

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think in some
sense, he brings

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.005 align:middle line:90%
all of that to Polonnaruwa.

>>When Catholics
look at Polonnaruwa,

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:51.860 align:middle line:84%
they might say,
oh, that was pagan.

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a pagan place.

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.680 align:middle line:84%
But for Merton, it
wasn't that way.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Because he really understood,
as the Dalai Lama said

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:04.230 align:middle line:84%
when I interviewed him
in India, all good paths

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.320 align:middle line:90%
lead to the same place.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.570 align:middle line:90%
This is God up here.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.870 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist finds
it in his way.

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:13.760 align:middle line:90%
The Muslim finds it in her way.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.210 align:middle line:90%
We Catholics find it in our way.

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:20.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's that point,
that point, that we all

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.400 align:middle line:90%
seek to be closer to God.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think we need
to be threatened at all.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:29.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we are enriched
by another tradition

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:34.980 align:middle line:84%

Merton so close to his God.

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:02.640 align:middle line:84%
