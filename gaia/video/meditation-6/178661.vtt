The greatest waste I think
we have in the country

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:84%
today is the wasting
of our human resources

00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%

inner resources that we

have at our disposal

goes untapped and undeveloped.

Every time I fly into New
York City, I think about 9/11,

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and I think about the people
calling from the airplane

to their family members.

And they were all calling
to say, I love you.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:84%
That was the last thing they
were going to say to somebody.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:84%

nothing else mattered.

that we need each
other to survive.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And our species has
evolved in a way

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:84%
that we understand
at the deepest levels

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:84%
that we are connected
to each other.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.660 align:middle line:84%

connected, I think

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.280 align:middle line:90%
that will change our politics.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
the 1%, the 99%.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.710 align:middle line:90%

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.200 align:middle line:84%

those inner resources

how to have and cultivate

that inner life, which
is I think fundamental.

improves by consistency.

I mean, if you
meditate every day,

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:90%
you can see on the scanner--

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:84%
neurologists can say
the more you do it,

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:90%
the better it is, right?

kind of brings you up.

It brings you into
alignment, you know?

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
asana is about, holding up--

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to move and smile and
breathe in every pose,

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:84%
right, but try to
make the poses-- get

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:84%
the proper alignment,
get the bricks in order.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:55.698 align:middle line:84%

we meditate, the way we sit.

fluctuation of the mind settle,

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:90%
and the nervous system settles.

a physical asana practice.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:84%

the more effective we are.

we're coming up with good ideas

was just riveting

compassion for myself

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:84%
the trembling or the quivering

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:39.600 align:middle line:84%
to seeing someone's
pain or suffering.

We hear so many messages
about what we need

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and what we should have and we
should never make a mistake.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:48.914 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's so many
things that we kind of take on.

00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
powerful, and it's

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.120 align:middle line:84%
kind of a big adventure to
say, well, you know what?

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Let me really look.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Let me see for myself.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So I feel very empowered by that
possibility of introspection

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.585 align:middle line:84%
and discernment and not
necessarily believing

00:31:06.585 --> 00:31:07.385 align:middle line:90%
all those messages.

but really of my life.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if I think

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I try to bring into
my day of integrity

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.060 align:middle line:84%

listening or compassion,

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.896 align:middle line:90%

May you be happy and

Before I started meditating,
I heard the word "meditation,"

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and it meant almost
nothing to me.

felt like maybe it's

I was accepted to the
American Film Institute,

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and I was given an opportunity

I was given money.

I had all the equipment I
could dream of given to me.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.770 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I remember
standing and looking

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.889 align:middle line:84%
at this wall,
thinking, I should be

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:34.770 align:middle line:90%
the happiest person on Earth.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But I looked inside, and
the happiness was just

a dance on the surface--

had great desires and ideas.

I had anxieties like

There's a thing in people where,
for one reason or another,

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.390 align:middle line:90%
suddenly they become a seeker.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.680 align:middle line:90%
They just become a seeker.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along
the line, I heard

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.200 align:middle line:84%
this phrase, true
happiness is not out there.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:90%
True happiness lies within.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And this phrase had a
ring of truth to it.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:54.710 align:middle line:84%
But the phrase doesn't tell you
where the "within" is, nor does

And those things that
used to stress you

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:08.210 align:middle line:84%
don't have the
same power anymore.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.510 align:middle line:90%
This is magical.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:13.390 align:middle line:90%

The sunlight in LA
makes me feel freedom.

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me feel the
field of all possibilities.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's a nice
thing to think about.

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The Maharishi said,
don't fight the darkness.

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't even worry about it.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Simply turn on the light.

Get down in there, and darkness,
negativity goes away in time,

is a closeness to ourselves

So, I live in New York City.

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:55.220 align:middle line:84%
We are sitting in my apartment
with my kids' toys everywhere

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and my work things
everywhere, food and plants

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.040 align:middle line:90%
and noise and cars.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And the whole city is
happening around us.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.470 align:middle line:84%
We're two blocks away
from that big protest.

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:11.354 align:middle line:90%


00:44:11.354 --> 00:44:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
before I learned how

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.256 align:middle line:84%
to just sit and
be still and watch

00:44:15.256 --> 00:44:19.370 align:middle line:84%
that all of the chaos and all
of the doubt and all the fear

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:26.050 align:middle line:84%
is actually exactly
the road to my freedom.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:30.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go to the
mountaintop to meditate.

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:33.920 align:middle line:84%
You should and could
do it right here.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.700 align:middle line:84%
This is where we figure out
exactly how much power we have.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:46.940 align:middle line:84%
I started trying to
meditate in 1998 when

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.950 align:middle line:90%
I was training to be a teacher.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And my teacher was a
Tibetan Buddhist teacher.

00:44:54.890 --> 00:45:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the practice
of meditation began for me.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:07.920 align:middle line:84%
I really struggled for a
really long time to sit at all.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:90%


00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And around 2000, 2001,
I met another teacher

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:21.000 align:middle line:84%
who taught me that five
minutes a day is all I need.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.684 align:middle line:84%
Just do five minutes,
dead or alive,

00:45:22.684 --> 00:45:23.808 align:middle line:90%
first thing in the morning.

00:45:23.808 --> 00:45:26.800 align:middle line:90%


00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.299 align:middle line:84%
To sit and be quiet
for five minutes

00:45:29.299 --> 00:45:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and just watch my breathing
and listen to the way

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:34.560 align:middle line:84%
it reached all these
different parts of my body

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:90%
was a big effort for me.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:45.110 align:middle line:84%
There is now a need
four in my life.

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:48.110 align:middle line:84%
As much as I need to brush
my teeth, I need to sit,

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:51.920 align:middle line:84%
because if I don't
sit, I feel the--

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.050 align:middle line:90%
I feel static inside.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:55.430 align:middle line:90%
I feel sharper.

00:45:55.430 --> 00:46:01.650 align:middle line:84%
I feel less a master
of my experience.

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:07.440 align:middle line:90%


00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:12.810 align:middle line:84%
In the practices of yoga and
particularly in meditation,

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:15.450 align:middle line:90%
it's you and you.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:17.910 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody else there.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And the hilarious
paradox is that we're

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:22.180 align:middle line:90%
tuning in to ourselves.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.997 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
the thing that helps

00:46:23.997 --> 00:46:25.080 align:middle line:90%
us listen to other people.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:33.610 align:middle line:90%


00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:36.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
aspects of my job,

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I feel as a teacher, is to make
sure that everybody is aware

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:45.720 align:middle line:84%
that everything that they do is
having an impact on all of us.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:52.920 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Every thought that I
have is impacting you.

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Every thought that you
have is impacting me.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Every move that I make
is impacting and rippling

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:03.840 align:middle line:90%
into everything around me.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.030 align:middle line:84%
We're all having these
little resonances

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:08.730 align:middle line:90%
with each other all the time.

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.830 align:middle line:84%
For more of us to
be meditating is

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:15.159 align:middle line:84%
to refine that resonance
so that when we share space

00:47:15.159 --> 00:47:16.950 align:middle line:84%
with another person,
when we share thoughts

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:20.820 align:middle line:84%
with another person, when we
share love with another person,

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:26.760 align:middle line:84%
there is not only a clarity, but
a directionality to what we're

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.840 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.920 align:middle line:90%
There's a purpose.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.730 align:middle line:90%
There's a mission.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.820 align:middle line:84%
This word keeps coming up,
but there's an elegance.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.220 align:middle line:90%
I longed for that as a kid.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.760 align:middle line:90%
I longed for even into my 20s.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Can I please just be elegant?

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.260 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I know what it looks like.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I recognize it in other
people, men and women.

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I just
find that in myself?

00:47:54.180 --> 00:48:00.700 align:middle line:84%
For all of us to go
deeper into that practice

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:07.220 align:middle line:84%
is to refine our contributions
on the Earth, our emanations.

I'm grateful for everything

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:21.020 align:middle line:84%
so that I can keep
perpetuating what is amazing.

in Himalayan country of Nepal,

actually well known as the
birthplace of Lord Buddha.

And I was born in that village.

It was my great fortune
to be born there.

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have devoted a
major part of my life

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.191 align:middle line:84%
in the study and practice

I was actually
enrolled in science.

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.207 align:middle line:90%
So I was doing physics and bio.

00:49:51.207 --> 00:49:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, I quit.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.540 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Otherwise I don't
know where I would end up--

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.610 align:middle line:90%
maybe some college or something.

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Because my senior
brother, he is engineer,

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's what my

Personally, I wanted
to be a doctor.

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I thought, maybe that way I
can serve the society better.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.080 align:middle line:90%
What was I searching for?

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.430 align:middle line:90%
What was I looking for?

What I really wanted to
do becomes very clear.

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Just like Buddha, I
want to get enlightened.

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:19.300 align:middle line:90%
I had such a burning desire.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:24.602 align:middle line:90%


00:50:24.602 --> 00:50:26.310 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was
trying to understand,

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:27.672 align:middle line:90%
what is this Western world?

00:50:27.672 --> 00:50:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Because by that
time, I had started

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:31.424 align:middle line:84%
hearing about it, the
Western world and then

00:50:31.424 --> 00:50:33.465 align:middle line:84%
these developed countries
and all of these ideas.

00:50:33.465 --> 00:50:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So I really wanted to
understand how it's going on.

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:41.142 align:middle line:84%
I realized all the genius people
born in Western hemisphere,

00:50:41.142 --> 00:50:44.010 align:middle line:84%
they have been somehow
naturally very interested

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:46.200 align:middle line:90%
in searching that is outer.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Like electricity was discovered
here, so many other things,

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:52.920 align:middle line:84%
these technologies, the
wonderful roads, buildings,

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and everything,
how to design, how

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.219 align:middle line:90%
to improve their life in outer.

00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And when I really
started searching deeply,

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:02.010 align:middle line:84%
I realized all the genius people
that were born in our culture,

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:07.590 align:middle line:84%
in our Eastern world,
somehow unknowingly devoted

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.600 align:middle line:84%
all their life, all
their time trying

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.710 align:middle line:84%
to find out something that
is inner, investigating mind.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:19.710 align:middle line:90%


00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Mind is a very
mysterious object.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:28.560 align:middle line:84%
It has no shape, no
form, and no address.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.092 align:middle line:90%
We never know where it lives.

00:51:30.092 --> 00:51:34.820 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So we say the
closest link to reach

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:40.820 align:middle line:84%
to the mind is with
the body, our own body.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And we can say, for example,
when we are very angry,

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and let's say our mind is
very angry at something,

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.370 align:middle line:84%
it starts showing
result in our body.

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Our heartbeats raise.

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:52.605 align:middle line:90%
Our breathing becomes very fast.

00:51:52.605 --> 00:51:54.230 align:middle line:84%
We start feeling hot
and this and that.

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Things happen.

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So ritual in a way
is to train the body.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:01.610 align:middle line:90%


00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:05.850 align:middle line:84%
When we calm down our
body, make it to relaxed,

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:09.790 align:middle line:84%
it becomes able to identify
the mind and work with it.

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:20.980 align:middle line:84%
There are certain facts, certain

how I'm going to work,

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:47.070 align:middle line:84%
what I'm going to work with,
and ultimately then what is made

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:53.100 align:middle line:84%
based on not predetermining what
I'm going to create before I

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.670 align:middle line:90%
actually make the thing.

01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:57.960 align:middle line:10%
So I choose materials
based on how

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:01.530 align:middle line:10%
they respond to me,
to the moment, body

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:03.350 align:middle line:10%

When I first started
thinking like this,

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I was using Hydrocal,
a combination

01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:14.800 align:middle line:90%
of cement and plaster.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And that material
within 5 to 10 minutes

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.280 align:middle line:84%
is transformed
from something that

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
is a liquid to something
that is completely hard.

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:30.245 align:middle line:84%
So it was like working against
time, with time, using time.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.290 align:middle line:84%
That was probably my
first Buddhist version

to be in the studio.

married to an artist,

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.650 align:middle line:84%
there was a process
of making art,

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
which is akin to the process
of making meditation,

01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
where you have to
be both the maker,

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%

lose yourself in the thing that

you are making.

would not identify as a Buddha.

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
But I realized I was already
thinking about this time issue

01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and that it had, in fact, made
me see this lump as something

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.890 align:middle line:90%
iconic.

01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And to have the Buddha around
was reminding me to pay

attention .

as anything but a practice,

I grew in the next two
years this family of Buddhas

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.509 align:middle line:10%

art but also something else.
