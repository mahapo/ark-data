00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:04.372
(ethereal music)

2
00:00:15.436 --> 00:00:17.169
<v Voiceover>There was a bright,</v>

3
00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:19.043
brilliant, white figure

4
00:00:19.043 --> 00:00:22.074
reflected in the windshield of the car.

5
00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:24.078
And I had the assurance that

6
00:00:24.078 --> 00:00:27.028
everything was gonna be alright.

7
00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Voiceover>He said, I'm going to be with you</v>

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.298
for a long time, I've

9
00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:33.508
I've known you for all your life

10
00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:37.621
and I've been your guardian angel all of your life.

11
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:38.824
<v Voiceover>I looked back up</v>

12
00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:40.892
and the face was still there

13
00:00:40.892 --> 00:00:45.697
and it was a warm feeling that the eyes were giving me.

14
00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:50.512
And instead of being frightened, I knew it was okay.

15
00:00:50.512 --> 00:00:51.504
<v Voiceover>The angel</v>

16
00:00:51.504 --> 00:00:54.701
who was present in that room touched me,

17
00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:57.466
and that made all the difference.

18
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.844
<v Voiceover>At that moment, I just felt</v>

19
00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:03.932
peace, and the thoughts quit going through my head

20
00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:07.279
all at once, and it was just

21
00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:10.605
one of the most wonderful feelings I've ever had.

22
00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:13.041
<v Voiceover>Angel's don't want the attention on them</v>

23
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:17.118
they want us focused beyond them.

24
00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Voiceover>And it's that angelic presence that binds us</v>

25
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.204
into one anothers' lives

26
00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:27.725
then we become so much more open

27
00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:31.525
to each other.

28
00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:33.461
<v ->Yes I do, I definitely do.</v>

29
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:35.727
<v ->Well sure, I mean you know, what else?</v>

30
00:01:35.727 --> 00:01:37.138
<v ->Sure I believe in them.</v>

31
00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:38.918
<v ->I gotta believe something's looking out for me.</v>

32
00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:40.204
<v ->Yes, I do.</v>

33
00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:40.895
<v ->Yes.</v>

34
00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:42.183
<v ->Sure I believe in 'em.</v>

35
00:01:42.183 --> 00:01:43.234
<v ->No, I don't.</v>

36
00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:44.389
<v ->If it had not been for angels,</v>

37
00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:46.177
I wouldn't even be alive today.

38
00:01:46.177 --> 00:01:48.460
<v ->During the time my father was ill,</v>

39
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.543
in the hospital... she appeared to me

40
00:01:52.543 --> 00:01:55.757
and stayed with me the entire time he was ill

41
00:01:55.757 --> 00:01:58.803
and the day he died, she disappeared.

42
00:01:58.803 --> 00:02:01.665
<v ->There's been too many times in my past,</v>

43
00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:05.416
or possibly in your own past where,

44
00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:07.786
very frankly, you've made it out of some scrapes

45
00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:09.284
somebody had to been watching over you.

46
00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:11.149
<v ->I been at crossroads in my life,</v>

47
00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:15.617
or in danger and they've just been there

48
00:02:15.617 --> 00:02:16.554
to protect me

49
00:02:16.554 --> 00:02:18.393
<v ->They're sort of like messengers</v>

50
00:02:18.393 --> 00:02:20.121
and they may even carry secrets of

51
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:21.743
the most inner part of the heart.

52
00:02:21.743 --> 00:02:23.768
<v ->It's a little bit like believing in ghosts I guess.</v>

53
00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:27.896
I just, never seen one, never met one.

54
00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:31.169
So I have no other way to believe in 'em.

55
00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.407
<v ->For an example, my dad</v>

56
00:02:33.407 --> 00:02:36.507
when I was 11 years old he was in an accident.

57
00:02:36.507 --> 00:02:39.081
He had an extensive brain injury.

58
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:40.992
He stayed unconscious for a little over a year

59
00:02:40.992 --> 00:02:43.715
in Phoenix, Arizona in the hospital.

60
00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:46.584
But he says when he woke up, there was an angel

61
00:02:46.584 --> 00:02:49.771
that was at the foot of his bed and the thing

62
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:52.216
about it is when he woke up

63
00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:53.144
he had been laying there

64
00:02:53.144 --> 00:02:54.559
and they had been rolling him in sheets

65
00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.995
to keep down bed sores and what have you

66
00:02:56.995 --> 00:03:01.356
and he had lost weight, he was just a skeleton you might say

67
00:03:01.356 --> 00:03:03.468
and that day he got up out of that bed

68
00:03:03.468 --> 00:03:06.924
and walked to the bathroom by hisself.

69
00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:09.211
<v Voiceover>My name is Pam Kidd.</v>

70
00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:11.589
While doing research for my magazine assignment

71
00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:13.350
on the subject of angels,

72
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.988
I came to one undeniable conclusion

73
00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:21.151
angel believers are all around.

74
00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:24.316
In fact a recent Time Magazine article

75
00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:27.368
announced that 69% of Americans believe

76
00:03:27.368 --> 00:03:29.728
that angels exist.

77
00:03:29.728 --> 00:03:32.944
And 46% of the population are convinced

78
00:03:32.944 --> 00:03:36.283
that they have their own guardian angel.

79
00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:39.844
Well actually, if you take a look at the big picture

80
00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.870
angels have been a part of people's lives

81
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.256
in every age across the planet.

82
00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:47.903
And respected authorities like John Ronner

83
00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:50.581
author of two best selling angel books

84
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:53.746
have discovered something through extensive research.

85
00:03:53.746 --> 00:03:57.288
<v ->In 1990 it was a Gallup poll showing that</v>

86
00:03:57.288 --> 00:04:00.582
13% of respondents felt that they had encountered

87
00:04:00.582 --> 00:04:03.095
an angel or some other supernatural being

88
00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:04.222
and that's a lot of people there

89
00:04:04.222 --> 00:04:05.727
that's over 30 million people if you

90
00:04:05.727 --> 00:04:07.882
extrapolate that out to the population

91
00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:09.376
six times the population

92
00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:11.986
of my home state of Tennessee.

93
00:04:11.986 --> 00:04:13.217
And many polls just like this

94
00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:15.506
the thing that is intriguing about this is

95
00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:18.436
the polls are unanimous

96
00:04:18.436 --> 00:04:20.778
they don't deviate one from the other

97
00:04:20.778 --> 00:04:23.118
they all indicate that a substantial minority of us

98
00:04:23.118 --> 00:04:25.043
are having these experiences.

99
00:04:25.043 --> 00:04:28.839
<v ->And if we go back just 150 years in our culture,</v>

100
00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.786
it was perfectly okay to talk about these things.

101
00:04:31.786 --> 00:04:35.440
Our great-grandparents knew about this kind of thing

102
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.892
very well and would talk about this

103
00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:42.680
and families would discuss visitations with the deceased

104
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.810
and what happened to Grandpa on his deathbed

105
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.419
and how he said that he saw a light

106
00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.196
and saw Grandma coming to him

107
00:04:51.196 --> 00:04:54.295
in those last few moments and so on.

108
00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:56.380
Then we went through a period I suppose

109
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.777
into this century where it just became

110
00:04:59.777 --> 00:05:02.387
not so respectable to talk about these things

111
00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:04.919
and they were dismissed and people thought

112
00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.337
that these were old wives' tales and superstitions.

113
00:05:09.337 --> 00:05:12.263
<v ->I think what's happening rather than it being a fad</v>

114
00:05:12.263 --> 00:05:14.199
is that we are reconnecting with a

115
00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.053
critical part of ourselves that we have been

116
00:05:16.053 --> 00:05:18.966
cut off from in western civilization.

117
00:05:18.966 --> 00:05:21.339
<v ->We interpret it to be a discovery</v>

118
00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:23.989
well it's really not, it's a rediscovery.

119
00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:25.723
These things are part and parcel

120
00:05:25.723 --> 00:05:27.628
of being a human being.

121
00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:30.868
And people have had spiritual experiences

122
00:05:30.868 --> 00:05:34.649
as long as there have been people.

123
00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:36.918
<v Voiceover>Like most issues of faith,</v>

124
00:05:36.918 --> 00:05:39.187
believing that a supreme being has devised

125
00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:41.863
this marvelous scheme that shadows

126
00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:44.232
each of us with a caring sponsor

127
00:05:44.232 --> 00:05:46.627
patron, messenger, guide,

128
00:05:46.627 --> 00:05:49.330
whatever you might call your angel

129
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.670
it's something you have to simply believe.

130
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.570
A short run through history can't help

131
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.009
but reinforce and refresh the angel believers confidence

132
00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:00.845
on the subject.

133
00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:02.714
From the beginning,

134
00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:05.283
artist's brush and sculptor's chisel

135
00:06:05.283 --> 00:06:09.573
were expressing this age old angel notion.

136
00:06:09.573 --> 00:06:12.690
If you doubt their prevalence look around

137
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.559
try conducting your own angel search.

138
00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:17.461
When my husband and I had a chance to visit

139
00:06:17.461 --> 00:06:19.941
several countries a few years ago

140
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:23.731
I used my camera for a private angel hunt.

141
00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:25.731
I found them on fountains,

142
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:30.345
atop street signs, on the facades of public buildings

143
00:06:30.345 --> 00:06:32.677
on the door posts of private homes

144
00:06:32.677 --> 00:06:35.319
angels everywhere.

145
00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.849
Remarkable, the lengths we go to depict angels

146
00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.778
when so few of us have seen angels

147
00:06:40.778 --> 00:06:42.791
face to face.

148
00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:47.254
Or is it really that rare?

149
00:06:47.254 --> 00:06:49.557
Alive today, who have actually

150
00:06:49.557 --> 00:06:52.930
looked into the eye of an angel?

151
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.786
Steve Hooper suffering from

152
00:06:54.786 --> 00:06:57.603
a severe and painful blood disorder

153
00:06:57.603 --> 00:07:00.540
awoke one night to an unexpected visitor

154
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.174
<v ->The room was just filled with a light</v>

155
00:07:03.174 --> 00:07:05.029
the brightest, whitest light

156
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:07.264
I've ever seen in my life.

157
00:07:07.264 --> 00:07:09.234
And at the foot of the bed

158
00:07:09.234 --> 00:07:14.018
was a figure... it was a man

159
00:07:14.018 --> 00:07:16.554
had shoulder length hair

160
00:07:16.554 --> 00:07:17.355
I could not make out

161
00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:20.404
any other features of the face.

162
00:07:20.404 --> 00:07:25.300
But the warmth filled the room

163
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.346
the love filled the room it filled my body

164
00:07:28.346 --> 00:07:31.479
I could just feel it all through me

165
00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:33.677
working all through me.

166
00:07:33.677 --> 00:07:35.206
I could actually see the wings,

167
00:07:35.206 --> 00:07:38.115
they were folded against the back

168
00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:39.934
and stood about a foot

169
00:07:39.934 --> 00:07:43.734
above the top of his head

170
00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:45.990
The only thing he spoke to me was

171
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.513
I am the angel of mercy.

172
00:07:48.513 --> 00:07:50.807
The next morning I asked my wife

173
00:07:50.807 --> 00:07:52.873
did you see her or hear anything strange

174
00:07:52.873 --> 00:07:53.925
in the middle of the night?

175
00:07:53.925 --> 00:07:56.767
And she says no, did the dog wake you again?

176
00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:58.296
And I said, no.

177
00:07:58.296 --> 00:08:00.554
She seemed to be okay, but did you

178
00:08:00.554 --> 00:08:03.827
see or feel or hear anything besides that?

179
00:08:03.827 --> 00:08:07.191
She said she hadn't.

180
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:09.810
I said don't worry about my iron test

181
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:10.945
coming up next month,

182
00:08:10.945 --> 00:08:13.164
I know it's gonna be okay.

183
00:08:13.164 --> 00:08:16.067
I've had the reassurance that everything is fine.

184
00:08:16.067 --> 00:08:17.908
<v Voiceover>And it was.</v>

185
00:08:17.908 --> 00:08:21.252
Steve's next blood test came back normal.

186
00:08:21.252 --> 00:08:25.568
Which according to his doctor was a near miracle.

187
00:08:27.858 --> 00:08:30.595
<v Voiceover>Office Randy Salazar found himself</v>

188
00:08:30.595 --> 00:08:33.264
in a terrible moral dilemma.

189
00:08:33.264 --> 00:08:35.930
A situation where the lives of an entire room

190
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.173
full of innocent people depended on what he did next.

191
00:08:39.173 --> 00:08:42.276
<v ->The doctor said, take the handcuffs off the prisoner.</v>

192
00:08:42.276 --> 00:08:44.605
And I told the doctor, I said, he's...

193
00:08:44.605 --> 00:08:45.743
I've had problems with this guy

194
00:08:45.743 --> 00:08:47.261
he's very combative, I don't want to.

195
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:50.198
He says, I'm the doctor you take the handcuffs off.

196
00:08:50.198 --> 00:08:53.187
I said okay, so I took the handcuffs off this man.

197
00:08:53.187 --> 00:08:54.808
The doctor was examining him

198
00:08:54.808 --> 00:08:58.228
and then he went through a series of questions

199
00:08:58.228 --> 00:09:00.848
to see how coherent he was.

200
00:09:00.848 --> 00:09:03.204
One of the questions was,

201
00:09:03.204 --> 00:09:04.699
What is today?

202
00:09:04.699 --> 00:09:08.645
And the prisoner said, today is Monday.

203
00:09:08.645 --> 00:09:11.144
And right then I looked in the prisoner's eyes

204
00:09:11.144 --> 00:09:13.937
and I said, and today is the day I kill you.

205
00:09:13.937 --> 00:09:15.737
But I said it in my mind, I didn't say it

206
00:09:15.737 --> 00:09:17.178
where you could hear it.

207
00:09:17.178 --> 00:09:19.544
And I'm wondering, why did I say that?

208
00:09:19.544 --> 00:09:23.318
Then, later on my partner arrived

209
00:09:23.318 --> 00:09:25.833
and we're there on the prisoner

210
00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:27.519
and he's being very combative.

211
00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:31.622
And then my partner and I heard a tray of dishes

212
00:09:31.622 --> 00:09:33.611
or something fall down the hallway.

213
00:09:33.611 --> 00:09:37.745
And we turned our faces to look to see what it was

214
00:09:37.745 --> 00:09:40.714
and at that point the prisoner jumped off the gurney

215
00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:43.067
and grabbed my partner around the waist.

216
00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:45.358
And at first I didn't think he saw his

217
00:09:45.358 --> 00:09:47.535
gun that he had stuck in his belt

218
00:09:47.535 --> 00:09:50.721
but he felt the gun and he pulled the gun out.

219
00:09:50.721 --> 00:09:53.107
I had no alternative but to pull my weapon

220
00:09:53.107 --> 00:09:56.083
and I, as soon as my partner

221
00:09:56.083 --> 00:09:58.682
and the prisoner fell to the floor

222
00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:01.082
I saw the gun pointed straight towards my

223
00:10:01.082 --> 00:10:04.088
partner's chest and I told Bob Russell, I said,

224
00:10:04.088 --> 00:10:05.757
Bob, get out of the way

225
00:10:05.757 --> 00:10:09.570
and I fired one shot into the abdomen of the prisoner

226
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.738
he fell back, with the gun in his hand

227
00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:17.313
and, much to my amazement he sat back up

228
00:10:17.313 --> 00:10:19.557
still and he pointed the gun at me.

229
00:10:19.557 --> 00:10:21.959
I stepped one step over to get out of the way

230
00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:24.525
But there, remember there's other people in this room

231
00:10:24.525 --> 00:10:26.137
and I'm thinking if he gets a shot off

232
00:10:26.137 --> 00:10:27.671
he's gonna kill somebody.

233
00:10:27.671 --> 00:10:29.696
At that point, I stood back

234
00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:32.823
and cocked the hammer back on my weapon

235
00:10:32.823 --> 00:10:36.976
and this image appeared on the wall

236
00:10:36.976 --> 00:10:41.065
and stated in a clear voice

237
00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:43.411
aimed at center that way you'll hit something

238
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:46.397
if you miss a little bit so I

239
00:10:46.397 --> 00:10:48.566
I pointed my gun and I shot the man

240
00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:51.301
right through the, shot him through the heart.

241
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:52.789
<v Voiceover>After the shooting</v>

242
00:10:52.789 --> 00:10:55.807
Salazar was naturally in agony over what had happened.

243
00:10:55.807 --> 00:10:57.471
He went to his mother's and his father's house

244
00:10:57.471 --> 00:10:59.414
to try to get some sort of comfort.

245
00:10:59.414 --> 00:11:01.416
<v ->And I stepped out and I took a few steps</v>

246
00:11:01.416 --> 00:11:05.178
towards their walkway that led up to the front door.

247
00:11:05.178 --> 00:11:07.986
I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.

248
00:11:07.986 --> 00:11:10.851
And at first I thought it was a light

249
00:11:10.851 --> 00:11:14.738
like a fluorescent light which was above the fence.

250
00:11:14.738 --> 00:11:17.708
And above this fence that was, that's

251
00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:21.106
seven to eight feet high, there was a face

252
00:11:21.106 --> 00:11:24.095
And there was this face that was looking at me

253
00:11:24.095 --> 00:11:27.001
very distinct, the eyes, nose, mouth and everything

254
00:11:27.001 --> 00:11:28.736
very pleasant and it was just looking at me

255
00:11:28.736 --> 00:11:31.215
and as I walked slowly towards the door

256
00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:34.642
the eyes of this face followed me.

257
00:11:34.642 --> 00:11:39.113
And I blinked and I stopped two-thirds of the way up

258
00:11:39.113 --> 00:11:42.119
to see if I was just you know, thinking this in my mind

259
00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:43.647
And it could not have been a person

260
00:11:43.647 --> 00:11:45.616
standing behind that fence because

261
00:11:45.616 --> 00:11:48.836
the face itself from the chin to the top of the head

262
00:11:48.836 --> 00:11:50.936
was at least 18 to 20 inches.

263
00:11:50.936 --> 00:11:54.268
So it was a very large face

264
00:11:54.268 --> 00:11:57.809
but it was, like I said it emanated a warm feeling

265
00:11:57.809 --> 00:12:01.472
and it's like, your mother embracing you

266
00:12:01.472 --> 00:12:06.077
holding you and saying it's gonna be okay.

267
00:12:06.077 --> 00:12:07.111
(exhales)

268
00:12:07.111 --> 00:12:09.994
Everything's okay.

269
00:12:09.994 --> 00:12:12.796
A few days later when I was looking through the Bible

270
00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:16.227
I had come across a passage in the Bible which says

271
00:12:16.227 --> 00:12:20.136
He who sees the face of God will be saved.

272
00:12:22.226 --> 00:12:24.962
<v ->My oldest daughter, Sarah, had a visit from her</v>

273
00:12:24.962 --> 00:12:26.804
guardian angel.

274
00:12:26.804 --> 00:12:29.632
This all started about a year ago,

275
00:12:29.632 --> 00:12:32.727
when we had a break in, in our home

276
00:12:32.727 --> 00:12:34.429
and Sarah was home from school

277
00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:39.170
so she was home alone when the intruders came in.

278
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.927
When I found Sarah she was hogtied, she was tied

279
00:12:43.927 --> 00:12:48.653
her hands to her feet and she appeared to have amnesia.

280
00:12:48.653 --> 00:12:52.907
<v ->This amnesia just left me, without anything.</v>

281
00:12:52.907 --> 00:12:57.631
I lost my life and I didn't feel like

282
00:12:57.631 --> 00:12:59.396
I had anything to live for.

283
00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:01.265
Because I didn't even get to remember

284
00:13:01.265 --> 00:13:03.368
the experience that I had.

285
00:13:03.368 --> 00:13:06.040
<v ->It was really kinda sad, you know</v>

286
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.538
I didn't know what to expect

287
00:13:07.538 --> 00:13:12.275
you know when I went over to see her that night.

288
00:13:12.275 --> 00:13:14.455
<v ->Before this accident we had grown kind of apart.</v>

289
00:13:14.455 --> 00:13:17.084
We hadn't really talked much anymore

290
00:13:17.084 --> 00:13:21.185
and after this, she just became my closest friend

291
00:13:21.185 --> 00:13:24.060
she'd come over, she would help me learn again

292
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.363
she would help me with my math and writing.

293
00:13:28.363 --> 00:13:30.905
Because I had to relearn those things all over again.

294
00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:35.045
<v ->One month, after the crime was committed.</v>

295
00:13:35.045 --> 00:13:37.471
Sarah fell down and had what appeared to be a

296
00:13:37.471 --> 00:13:42.286
seizure, it looked like a grand mal type seizure.

297
00:13:42.286 --> 00:13:45.065
<v Voiceover>Sarah had been diagnosed as suffering from</v>

298
00:13:45.065 --> 00:13:46.941
Dissociative Amnesia.

299
00:13:46.941 --> 00:13:49.920
A form of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.

300
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.322
And it was during the subsequent seizures

301
00:13:52.322 --> 00:13:55.135
that the terrifying details of the crime

302
00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:57.381
returned to Sarah's memory.

303
00:13:57.381 --> 00:13:59.473
<v ->I saw,</v>

304
00:13:59.473 --> 00:14:02.513
some pant legs and feet or

305
00:14:02.513 --> 00:14:05.436
someone was standing there and they were holding a crowbar

306
00:14:05.436 --> 00:14:07.798
trying to open my window.

307
00:14:07.798 --> 00:14:09.266
<v Voiceover>The people came up on the roof</v>

308
00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:13.214
and they took a crowbar and hit the window frame

309
00:14:13.214 --> 00:14:15.246
to cause these cam locks to fall.

310
00:14:15.246 --> 00:14:18.183
<v Voiceover>I became completely hysterical</v>

311
00:14:18.183 --> 00:14:21.729
I tried to dial my mom's work, the line was busy

312
00:14:21.729 --> 00:14:23.754
so I tried to run downstairs

313
00:14:23.754 --> 00:14:25.719
and see if there was any keys in the house

314
00:14:25.719 --> 00:14:28.671
and my sister had taken the last set.

315
00:14:28.671 --> 00:14:31.969
So I was deadbolted in and I figured the only other thing

316
00:14:31.969 --> 00:14:34.058
I could do is go upstairs in my parents room

317
00:14:34.058 --> 00:14:37.996
because they had some loaded guns

318
00:14:37.996 --> 00:14:41.920
and if it came to that that's all I would have.

319
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.955
When I got to the hallway upstairs

320
00:14:44.955 --> 00:14:46.791
I noticed I didn't hear anything else

321
00:14:46.791 --> 00:14:49.766
I didn't hear any footsteps or noises or talking

322
00:14:49.766 --> 00:14:52.380
and I figured that they had seen me

323
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.710
run down the stairs and they left.

324
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.830
I went to go look out the window

325
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.699
to see if I could see a car leaving or something

326
00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:06.445
and that's when two guys jumped out of my closet.

327
00:15:08.835 --> 00:15:11.062
The bigger one that seemed to be in charge

328
00:15:11.062 --> 00:15:14.032
grabbed a pillow, put the pillow on my head

329
00:15:14.032 --> 00:15:17.249
in order to smother me.

330
00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:20.270
I did get out from under the pillow at that point

331
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.358
and when my head moved back I saw

332
00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:28.085
that the bigger guy had a tattoo on his arm.

333
00:15:28.085 --> 00:15:31.749
When he realized that I did see that tattoo

334
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:34.089
he became enraged

335
00:15:34.089 --> 00:15:37.919
and he hit me

336
00:15:37.919 --> 00:15:41.949
in the head and I fell over

337
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:46.559
and that's the point when I died.

338
00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:51.231
After I left my body I found myself

339
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:54.217
waking up underneath a tree

340
00:15:54.217 --> 00:15:58.181
and in a place that

341
00:15:58.181 --> 00:16:00.591
seemed to be the best place

342
00:16:00.591 --> 00:16:02.613
that anybody could ever be.

343
00:16:02.613 --> 00:16:04.762
This is a place I call heaven this is a place

344
00:16:04.762 --> 00:16:06.144
that I would definitely

345
00:16:06.144 --> 00:16:10.354
want to spend eternity.

346
00:16:10.354 --> 00:16:12.523
As I began to look around I saw

347
00:16:12.523 --> 00:16:14.811
a figure approaching me

348
00:16:14.811 --> 00:16:18.315
and it turned out to be a good friend of mine.

349
00:16:20.785 --> 00:16:24.918
And he had passed away four days before,

350
00:16:24.918 --> 00:16:25.965
Brian walked up to me

351
00:16:25.965 --> 00:16:29.268
and simply explained to me

352
00:16:29.268 --> 00:16:31.468
what was happening to me

353
00:16:31.468 --> 00:16:36.239
and he said I was gonna be okay and I was gonna be spared.

354
00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:41.102
For a certain reason, I had something to do.

355
00:16:44.052 --> 00:16:47.391
He said he had someone to introduce to me,

356
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:50.494
shortly after, someone else walked up

357
00:16:50.494 --> 00:16:55.494
and we got closer, it was a tall man in a white suit

358
00:16:55.499 --> 00:16:59.634
and a white top hat who spoke with a British accent

359
00:16:59.634 --> 00:17:04.634
and he said I'm going to be with you

360
00:17:04.716 --> 00:17:05.766
for a long time.

361
00:17:05.766 --> 00:17:09.794
I've known you all your life and I've been your

362
00:17:09.794 --> 00:17:14.352
guardian angel all of your life.

363
00:17:14.352 --> 00:17:15.779
He said he didn't want me to be afraid

364
00:17:15.779 --> 00:17:19.203
because what was happening to me would be okay

365
00:17:19.203 --> 00:17:23.294
cause I wasn't gonna, I wasn't dying

366
00:17:23.294 --> 00:17:25.383
I was gonna...

367
00:17:25.383 --> 00:17:29.193
I would have to go back

368
00:17:29.193 --> 00:17:34.166
and then he told me I was brought there to rest.

369
00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:38.986
And to gain the courage and energy to go on

370
00:17:38.986 --> 00:17:42.212
and finish what I was supposed to finish.

371
00:17:42.212 --> 00:17:44.882
Seemed like everything started to kind of fade out

372
00:17:44.882 --> 00:17:48.368
and then I was back in my room before I knew it.

373
00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:52.372
When I woke up again my dog was licking me on the face

374
00:17:52.372 --> 00:17:56.772
and I didn't know

375
00:17:56.772 --> 00:17:59.272
where I was or who I was

376
00:17:59.272 --> 00:18:03.233
or how I got there and why I was tied up.

377
00:18:03.233 --> 00:18:05.916
I saw the phone cord runnin' right across my face

378
00:18:05.916 --> 00:18:08.632
it was sitting up on the bed and I was on the floor.

379
00:18:08.632 --> 00:18:10.728
I pulled the cord with my teeth.

380
00:18:10.728 --> 00:18:12.950
And the phone fell on the floor

381
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:17.305
and it got knocked off the hook so I could use it.

382
00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:20.050
I pressed redial because I figured maybe somebody knew me.

383
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:24.550
And before I could panic I needed to get some help.

384
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.757
When it pressed redial it dialed my mom's work

385
00:18:26.757 --> 00:18:30.327
cause that's who I called before the people came in.

386
00:18:30.327 --> 00:18:33.844
My mom's boss answered and she talked to me

387
00:18:33.844 --> 00:18:37.404
tried to figure out who I was and she couldn't tell

388
00:18:37.404 --> 00:18:40.581
so she got on the loud speaker and told all her employees

389
00:18:40.581 --> 00:18:44.240
that there was a kid on the phone who was in a pink bedroom

390
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.911
tied up and there was a lot of teddy bears around.

391
00:18:48.911 --> 00:18:51.655
My mom knew that was my room

392
00:18:51.655 --> 00:18:54.014
so she raced home.

393
00:18:54.014 --> 00:18:55.953
<v Voiceover>Something occurred while in the presence</v>

394
00:18:55.953 --> 00:18:58.822
of the psychologist who had been making regular visits

395
00:18:58.822 --> 00:19:02.403
to Sarah's home to help her regain her memory.

396
00:19:02.403 --> 00:19:05.919
<v ->My psychologist she was trying to calm me down</v>

397
00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:09.922
cause nobody else really could.

398
00:19:09.922 --> 00:19:12.253
I was to the point where I wasn't even listening to anybody

399
00:19:12.253 --> 00:19:14.858
I was just rocking back and forth

400
00:19:14.858 --> 00:19:17.774
and trying to sing to myself.

401
00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:24.030
While I was talking to her a light appeared

402
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.856
and it appeared as a circular shape

403
00:19:26.856 --> 00:19:30.107
and then it came down to be a long oval.

404
00:19:30.107 --> 00:19:34.057
And that was George.

405
00:19:36.477 --> 00:19:38.265
Immediately I just stopped crying

406
00:19:38.265 --> 00:19:43.265
and Sharon just seemed amazed, she said,

407
00:19:43.289 --> 00:19:44.700
How come you calmed down so quickly?

408
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.304
And I said, well he says I'm gonna be okay.

409
00:19:47.304 --> 00:19:49.646
He's gonna take care of me now.

410
00:19:49.646 --> 00:19:51.368
<v Voiceover>Sarah's guardian angel</v>

411
00:19:51.368 --> 00:19:55.215
who became fondly known as George

412
00:19:55.215 --> 00:19:57.768
helped in Sarah's emotional healing

413
00:19:57.768 --> 00:19:59.579
and reached out to touch the lives

414
00:19:59.579 --> 00:20:02.025
of her family and friends.

415
00:20:02.025 --> 00:20:04.491
<v ->In the next few minutes I was laughing</v>

416
00:20:04.491 --> 00:20:06.930
I had just completely forgotten about

417
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.093
any worries that I had

418
00:20:09.093 --> 00:20:11.335
and in the next few minutes he says,

419
00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.467
you need to take care of your sister,

420
00:20:13.467 --> 00:20:16.909
she's amazed and very upset

421
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:21.769
by what happened to you.

422
00:20:21.769 --> 00:20:23.513
I said okay, I came downstairs

423
00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:27.254
and she was almost as bad off as I was before.

424
00:20:27.254 --> 00:20:29.598
<v ->So he had come down there with her</v>

425
00:20:29.598 --> 00:20:33.518
I guess, so, and...

426
00:20:33.518 --> 00:20:36.918
she sat over on this coffee table

427
00:20:36.918 --> 00:20:39.732
in our living room.

428
00:20:39.732 --> 00:20:40.951
She just kind of looked at me

429
00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:44.818
and I looked over at her, but I didn't stop crying

430
00:20:44.818 --> 00:20:48.363
it just made me worse, looking at her

431
00:20:48.363 --> 00:20:52.489
and she told me to put my hand over on a

432
00:20:52.489 --> 00:20:55.172
certain place on the couch.

433
00:20:55.172 --> 00:20:57.174
Didn't know why, but I did it

434
00:20:57.174 --> 00:21:02.046
and at that moment I just felt peace

435
00:21:02.046 --> 00:21:06.920
and the thoughts quit going through my head all at once

436
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.756
and it was just one of the most

437
00:21:08.756 --> 00:21:11.955
wonderful feelings I've ever had.

438
00:21:11.955 --> 00:21:16.310
So she just looked at my mom,

439
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.396
and I'm sure my mom was puzzled.

440
00:21:19.396 --> 00:21:22.835
<v ->My mother looked at me</v>

441
00:21:22.835 --> 00:21:24.708
as if to be in question

442
00:21:24.708 --> 00:21:28.802
and I told her to sit down

443
00:21:28.802 --> 00:21:32.291
and I said,

444
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.161
I have an angel

445
00:21:34.161 --> 00:21:35.646
and he's gonna be with me for a while

446
00:21:35.646 --> 00:21:38.048
he's gonna help us get through this.

447
00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:42.095
And she just said, well okay.

448
00:21:42.095 --> 00:21:44.742
And I said, he says,

449
00:21:44.742 --> 00:21:46.376
he says he's been with me for a long time

450
00:21:46.376 --> 00:21:48.051
since I was a baby

451
00:21:48.051 --> 00:21:51.341
and then I started laughing.

452
00:21:51.341 --> 00:21:53.690
And she said, why are you laughing?

453
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.747
And I said, well he says that,

454
00:21:56.747 --> 00:22:00.383
when I was a little kid I used to laugh at him

455
00:22:00.383 --> 00:22:03.036
because he had this big hat that he always had to

456
00:22:03.036 --> 00:22:05.048
push out of his eyes

457
00:22:05.048 --> 00:22:09.023
and she started to cry.

458
00:22:09.023 --> 00:22:10.681
<v ->And Mark and I looked at each other</v>

459
00:22:10.681 --> 00:22:13.397
and I started crying because there was a time

460
00:22:13.397 --> 00:22:15.446
when she was two and three years old

461
00:22:15.446 --> 00:22:17.250
when she would laugh a lot

462
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.768
and we'd peak in her room and say,

463
00:22:18.768 --> 00:22:22.392
what are you laughing at and she'd say,

464
00:22:22.392 --> 00:22:23.927
the man with the big hat comes

465
00:22:23.927 --> 00:22:25.829
and makes me laugh all the time.

466
00:22:25.829 --> 00:22:28.401
And she would draw pictures of him

467
00:22:28.401 --> 00:22:31.549
and we were just floored by it

468
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:33.133
we, you know, we

469
00:22:33.133 --> 00:22:34.284
then I began to think

470
00:22:34.284 --> 00:22:37.093
well something is really going on here.

471
00:22:37.093 --> 00:22:39.766
<v ->I think we've probably always known intellectually</v>

472
00:22:39.766 --> 00:22:43.182
that children have an innate spirituality.

473
00:22:43.182 --> 00:22:47.234
But I don't think that it's become anything really concrete

474
00:22:47.234 --> 00:22:49.426
at least it certainly wasn't for me

475
00:22:49.426 --> 00:22:52.352
until recently when I began getting these letters

476
00:22:52.352 --> 00:22:55.127
and I was just in awe

477
00:22:55.127 --> 00:22:57.477
of what was being described here.

478
00:22:57.477 --> 00:23:00.360
And that's how I began to hear stories

479
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.382
about imaginary friends.

480
00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:04.377
Now pediatricians have known for years

481
00:23:04.377 --> 00:23:07.166
that children create these things,

482
00:23:07.166 --> 00:23:08.711
they need a friend because they're lonely

483
00:23:08.711 --> 00:23:10.074
because their older brothers and sisters

484
00:23:10.074 --> 00:23:12.398
have gone to school and so they'll have somebody

485
00:23:12.398 --> 00:23:14.484
named Margie who will come

486
00:23:14.484 --> 00:23:16.814
and sit at the dinner table with them or something.

487
00:23:16.814 --> 00:23:20.250
And everyone kind of patiently pats them on the head

488
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.089
and thinks well this will be over soon

489
00:23:23.089 --> 00:23:24.891
as soon as they get older.

490
00:23:24.891 --> 00:23:29.693
It will be over soon but I think that the Margies

491
00:23:29.693 --> 00:23:34.397
might actually be angels that are with them for a time

492
00:23:34.397 --> 00:23:38.121
and then as that veil between heaven and earth

493
00:23:38.121 --> 00:23:40.343
begins to descend

494
00:23:40.343 --> 00:23:43.457
farther and farther down and children get older

495
00:23:43.457 --> 00:23:47.050
and move farther and farther away from their heavenly roots

496
00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.276
they don't see these things anymore.

497
00:23:49.276 --> 00:23:53.204
They were bringing something of heaven to earth

498
00:23:53.204 --> 00:23:56.612
for a short period.

499
00:23:58.822 --> 00:24:00.824
<v Voiceover>George's desire to heal</v>

500
00:24:00.824 --> 00:24:03.487
did not limit itself to Sarah.

501
00:24:03.487 --> 00:24:07.667
<v ->Debbie and Sarah and Helen came over</v>

502
00:24:07.667 --> 00:24:10.581
after George had appeared to Sarah

503
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:14.972
and we were sitting around the kitchen table visiting

504
00:24:14.972 --> 00:24:17.441
and it was just kind of an awesome experience to

505
00:24:17.441 --> 00:24:20.144
begin with cause we would talk to Sarah

506
00:24:20.144 --> 00:24:23.054
and ask her questions and of George

507
00:24:23.054 --> 00:24:27.499
and George would respond and it was just

508
00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:32.151
it was really an exciting period anyway

509
00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:35.292
or time or event but when

510
00:24:35.292 --> 00:24:36.494
we were sitting there at the table

511
00:24:36.494 --> 00:24:38.495
Sarah, you could tell she was listening to George

512
00:24:38.495 --> 00:24:42.245
and she'd kind of look off and she kinda nodded her head

513
00:24:42.245 --> 00:24:43.434
and she said Annie come here

514
00:24:43.434 --> 00:24:46.102
and they got up and left the table

515
00:24:46.102 --> 00:24:48.438
and went into Annie's room and closed the door.

516
00:24:48.438 --> 00:24:49.890
She had done so much for me

517
00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.380
and I had asked her is there anything

518
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.020
that I can possibly do

519
00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.416
to let you know how much I appreciate you.

520
00:25:02.016 --> 00:25:06.456
She said is it possible that you could

521
00:25:06.456 --> 00:25:08.792
heal me of my sickness

522
00:25:08.792 --> 00:25:11.633
she's constantly sick all the time

523
00:25:11.633 --> 00:25:15.799
with allergies and she's had pneumonia a couple of times

524
00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:18.969
and asthma

525
00:25:18.969 --> 00:25:21.004
just everything you can name.

526
00:25:21.004 --> 00:25:23.703
<v ->The last two years she's</v>

527
00:25:23.703 --> 00:25:26.742
seemed to have gotten worse as far as the fatigue goes

528
00:25:26.742 --> 00:25:29.169
and was actually on Homebound through school

529
00:25:29.169 --> 00:25:33.489
she couldn't even make it at school.

530
00:25:33.489 --> 00:25:36.626
And this lasted for about a year and a half

531
00:25:36.626 --> 00:25:39.322
she would be sick with bronchitis

532
00:25:39.322 --> 00:25:40.924
she'd be well for about a week or so,

533
00:25:40.924 --> 00:25:43.059
not well but she wouldn't have the bronchitis

534
00:25:43.059 --> 00:25:45.605
so she would still be extremely tired.

535
00:25:45.605 --> 00:25:49.059
<v ->And I called George into her room</v>

536
00:25:49.059 --> 00:25:51.718
and we just sat and talked for awhile

537
00:25:51.718 --> 00:25:56.005
just to get her comfortable with him

538
00:25:56.005 --> 00:26:00.552
and George said, tell her to put her hand beside her.

539
00:26:02.512 --> 00:26:07.251
And she did, and he put his hand on hers

540
00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:09.886
and I said let's just pray and we did.

541
00:26:09.886 --> 00:26:11.905
<v ->Sarah told me everything he was gonna do</v>

542
00:26:11.905 --> 00:26:14.490
and to just relax and he did it

543
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.694
and he just you know put his hand on me

544
00:26:17.694 --> 00:26:20.564
and I don't know what he did or what he said

545
00:26:20.564 --> 00:26:23.466
or how he did it but you know

546
00:26:23.466 --> 00:26:24.701
all I know is, he put his hand on me

547
00:26:24.701 --> 00:26:28.287
and then it became

548
00:26:28.287 --> 00:26:31.127
better very quickly.

549
00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:32.085
<v Voiceover>The Homebound teachers</v>

550
00:26:32.085 --> 00:26:34.816
that had worked with her was just like well...

551
00:26:34.816 --> 00:26:36.947
especially one in particular, Myra

552
00:26:36.947 --> 00:26:39.526
she had tears in her eyes and just was,

553
00:26:39.526 --> 00:26:42.522
What? What happened? I mean you know, this is just wonderful

554
00:26:42.522 --> 00:26:45.155
she's doing so great and I could just look at her

555
00:26:45.155 --> 00:26:47.657
with tears in my eyes and say it's been a miracle

556
00:26:47.657 --> 00:26:49.243
because it has been,

557
00:26:49.243 --> 00:26:53.413
it's been an incredible miracle.

558
00:26:53.413 --> 00:26:56.178
<v Voiceover>When Sarah was fully recovered</v>

559
00:26:56.178 --> 00:26:59.002
George prepared her for his departure.

560
00:26:59.002 --> 00:27:02.739
<v ->George said, since you're awake</v>

561
00:27:02.739 --> 00:27:03.473
why don't you come in here

562
00:27:03.473 --> 00:27:06.046
and bring some paper and a pencil?

563
00:27:06.046 --> 00:27:07.644
I said okay, I will.

564
00:27:07.644 --> 00:27:10.504
And I thought we were gonna play a game,

565
00:27:10.504 --> 00:27:13.316
and so I went into another room

566
00:27:13.316 --> 00:27:14.417
brought my paper and pencil

567
00:27:14.417 --> 00:27:18.855
and he told me to write down everything that he said.

568
00:27:18.855 --> 00:27:20.554
"You must see that everyone within your reach

569
00:27:20.554 --> 00:27:23.510
"hears about what happened to you, all of it,

570
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.447
"you must open their eyes and give them hope.

571
00:27:26.447 --> 00:27:27.987
"Dedicate your soul to healing people

572
00:27:27.987 --> 00:27:31.519
"simply by talking and letting everyone know

573
00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:34.498
"how the world is changing.

574
00:27:34.498 --> 00:27:36.777
"You'll begin to get responses,

575
00:27:36.777 --> 00:27:39.769
"ideas will come, solutions to problems will appear

576
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:41.772
"and the people will send you letters suggesting

577
00:27:41.772 --> 00:27:43.780
"and supporting you.

578
00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.320
"Some people will be negative but these are the people

579
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.118
"that are harder to reach.

580
00:27:48.118 --> 00:27:50.853
"Don't let them discourage you.

581
00:27:50.853 --> 00:27:54.493
"You have proven to be strong and your family as well.

582
00:27:54.493 --> 00:27:56.726
"I know you can get through this

583
00:27:56.726 --> 00:27:58.998
"and when you do,

584
00:27:58.998 --> 00:28:02.866
"you'll come out even more strong than before.

585
00:28:02.866 --> 00:28:04.234
"You're the mouth that they will hear

586
00:28:04.234 --> 00:28:07.705
"because you are a child... a child of God

587
00:28:07.705 --> 00:28:11.958
"and a child who can bring hope to God's people.

588
00:28:11.958 --> 00:28:15.294
"Please stay peaceful and one with God."

589
00:28:17.484 --> 00:28:18.996
<v ->I have to thank him,</v>

590
00:28:18.996 --> 00:28:22.999
as I have to thank God,

591
00:28:22.999 --> 00:28:25.708
that he...

592
00:28:25.708 --> 00:28:28.028
did for Sarah

593
00:28:28.028 --> 00:28:31.228
so many things that for a time

594
00:28:31.228 --> 00:28:33.596
I could not do.

595
00:28:33.596 --> 00:28:35.499
<v ->And she told me George was gone</v>

596
00:28:35.499 --> 00:28:39.035
and I was, it was like a death

597
00:28:39.035 --> 00:28:41.952
of someone in the immediate family

598
00:28:41.952 --> 00:28:45.802
it was like a death of somebody that I had been

599
00:28:45.802 --> 00:28:48.138
close to all my life.

600
00:28:48.138 --> 00:28:49.498
And I didn't know whether I was

601
00:28:49.498 --> 00:28:51.885
feeling all the pain for Sarah

602
00:28:51.885 --> 00:28:55.812
and thinking how she must feel, just devastated.

603
00:28:55.812 --> 00:29:00.690
And, or whether it was just my own, you know, self

604
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.334
missing his presence and knowing that

605
00:29:04.334 --> 00:29:07.547
he wouldn't be around the same way anymore.

606
00:29:07.547 --> 00:29:10.660
<v ->I think everybody has their own personal</v>

607
00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.003
guardian angel.

608
00:29:12.003 --> 00:29:13.640
And it's really amazing to think that there's

609
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.771
somebody just for me

610
00:29:14.771 --> 00:29:17.541
somebody that God sent just for me.

611
00:29:19.431 --> 00:29:23.013
That's what I always think if I ever fell down.

612
00:29:23.013 --> 00:29:24.957
<v Voiceover>A noticeable side effect in those</v>

613
00:29:24.957 --> 00:29:28.017
whose lives have been touched by an angel

614
00:29:28.017 --> 00:29:31.682
is a profound change in their sense of priorities.

615
00:29:33.802 --> 00:29:36.260
<v ->I just feel like Sarah's had a glimpse</v>

616
00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.762
of something the rest of us haven't

617
00:29:38.762 --> 00:29:40.830
and so it's changed the way she

618
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.478
looks at everything and everybody.

619
00:29:45.478 --> 00:29:49.072
She sees what's really important.

620
00:29:49.072 --> 00:29:51.511
<v ->Faith is the one thing that people should have</v>

621
00:29:51.511 --> 00:29:54.717
and you can't just

622
00:29:54.717 --> 00:29:57.042
get faith by seeing something and then believing it.

623
00:29:57.042 --> 00:29:59.581
You have to

624
00:30:02.121 --> 00:30:03.687
You have to have doubts first

625
00:30:03.687 --> 00:30:04.921
and then come through

626
00:30:04.921 --> 00:30:08.551
and you have to learn by other things and...

627
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:16.567
Trust is another part of faith.

628
00:30:16.567 --> 00:30:17.440
Just like the Bible,

629
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.236
you have to believe, you have to believe the Word of God,

630
00:30:20.236 --> 00:30:21.538
you can't go up to 'em and say

631
00:30:21.538 --> 00:30:22.472
well how do I know this is true?

632
00:30:22.472 --> 00:30:23.906
What are you gonna give me?

633
00:30:23.906 --> 00:30:26.642
What are you gonna show me?

634
00:30:26.642 --> 00:30:31.113
This is... a world now that people have to receive something

635
00:30:31.113 --> 00:30:32.382
before they believe anything.

636
00:30:32.382 --> 00:30:34.217
Everything revolves around

637
00:30:34.217 --> 00:30:37.220
what you're gonna get before you give anything.

638
00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.553
And I think it should be the other way around.

639
00:30:40.553 --> 00:30:43.259
<v ->We wanna be happy doing things together</v>

640
00:30:43.259 --> 00:30:45.732
not gaining things together, you know

641
00:30:45.732 --> 00:30:49.165
it's not the house, not the car,

642
00:30:49.165 --> 00:30:53.902
money, but it's how many wonderful

643
00:30:53.902 --> 00:30:56.482
good times can we have together?

644
00:30:56.482 --> 00:30:58.161
<v ->We're not here simply to</v>

645
00:30:58.161 --> 00:31:01.243
to see, you know, how many dollars we can make,

646
00:31:01.243 --> 00:31:04.110
"He who dies with the most toys wins."

647
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.815
We're not to be like the Pharaohs,

648
00:31:05.815 --> 00:31:07.303
you know, amassing treasures

649
00:31:07.303 --> 00:31:09.131
and then baring it all with ourselves,

650
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:10.753
there's something more to this life.

651
00:31:10.753 --> 00:31:12.654
<v ->This one philosopher said,</v>

652
00:31:12.654 --> 00:31:15.652
there's a God-shaped hole in each of us

653
00:31:15.652 --> 00:31:18.494
and it can only be filled with God.

654
00:31:18.494 --> 00:31:20.830
And what happens is, I think.

655
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.734
We try to fill it with a lot of other things,

656
00:31:23.734 --> 00:31:26.643
we've had decades you know

657
00:31:26.643 --> 00:31:30.422
maybe from the early 60s when we took God out of everything

658
00:31:30.422 --> 00:31:32.107
we didn't need Him in our schools anymore,

659
00:31:32.107 --> 00:31:34.044
we weren't going to pray to Him in public,

660
00:31:34.044 --> 00:31:36.246
God was reserved for Sunday mornings,

661
00:31:36.246 --> 00:31:39.068
if you wanted to even make the effort.

662
00:31:39.068 --> 00:31:41.077
And we were a stalwart people,

663
00:31:41.077 --> 00:31:43.019
we were a proud people

664
00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:45.802
we didn't need to be on our knees.

665
00:31:45.802 --> 00:31:49.358
And that evolved into a culture of drugs,

666
00:31:49.358 --> 00:31:51.394
that was where we were going to find our God

667
00:31:51.394 --> 00:31:54.106
and immorality and then that went into

668
00:31:54.106 --> 00:31:56.633
a culture of the "Me generation"

669
00:31:56.633 --> 00:31:58.501
and then that kind of went into a culture of

670
00:31:58.501 --> 00:32:01.320
materialism and acquiring things

671
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.339
and through all of this our hearts

672
00:32:03.339 --> 00:32:05.905
have become more and more empty.

673
00:32:05.905 --> 00:32:08.377
That God-shaped hole that we've tried to fill

674
00:32:08.377 --> 00:32:10.747
with all these other things has become

675
00:32:10.747 --> 00:32:12.565
more and more wounded.

676
00:32:12.565 --> 00:32:14.016
<v ->It's really no accident that materialism</v>

677
00:32:14.016 --> 00:32:15.852
is on the wane.

678
00:32:15.852 --> 00:32:17.086
That the leading thinkers,

679
00:32:17.086 --> 00:32:19.622
the intellectual movers and shakers of our culture

680
00:32:19.622 --> 00:32:23.025
are changing their minds in mass

681
00:32:23.025 --> 00:32:24.140
and coming around to the idea

682
00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.659
that we don't live in a big machine

683
00:32:25.659 --> 00:32:28.057
that's cold and has no connection with us

684
00:32:28.057 --> 00:32:30.039
but we do live in a spiritual universe.

685
00:32:30.039 --> 00:32:31.701
It's happening because there are developments

686
00:32:31.701 --> 00:32:33.503
coming out of science itself

687
00:32:33.503 --> 00:32:35.505
you have the anthropic principle which

688
00:32:35.505 --> 00:32:38.140
indicates to us that we live in a universe

689
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.437
that appears to have been designed

690
00:32:40.437 --> 00:32:43.813
by an invisible hand a universe that

691
00:32:43.813 --> 00:32:45.148
has resulted in us being here

692
00:32:45.148 --> 00:32:47.571
against incredible odds.

693
00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:49.015
You have the Gaia hypothesis

694
00:32:49.015 --> 00:32:52.666
which indicates that the very planet that we live on

695
00:32:52.666 --> 00:32:55.358
and all of its' functioning systems that keep us alive

696
00:32:55.358 --> 00:32:58.562
are here against incredible odds.

697
00:32:58.562 --> 00:33:00.197
You have quantum physics

698
00:33:00.197 --> 00:33:03.399
which shows us that our basic reality

699
00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:05.268
the reality that our world is based on

700
00:33:05.268 --> 00:33:07.057
down there at that little sub-atomic level

701
00:33:07.057 --> 00:33:08.905
is a never never land

702
00:33:08.905 --> 00:33:13.443
a place where consciousness shapes reality and determines it

703
00:33:13.443 --> 00:33:15.882
where reality is not where matter is not

704
00:33:15.882 --> 00:33:19.586
supreme indeed, matter in a very real sense

705
00:33:19.586 --> 00:33:22.615
has no existence apart from consciousness

706
00:33:22.615 --> 00:33:25.455
apart from the observer looking at it.

707
00:33:25.455 --> 00:33:27.353
<v Voiceover>Quantum physics</v>

708
00:33:27.353 --> 00:33:29.526
alternate reality

709
00:33:29.526 --> 00:33:33.462
pretty difficult concepts for some of us to grasp.

710
00:33:33.462 --> 00:33:38.133
But there are stories too of angels taking human form

711
00:33:38.133 --> 00:33:40.987
and others of humans who seem to somehow be

712
00:33:40.987 --> 00:33:45.475
promoted to angel status for a brief period.

713
00:33:45.475 --> 00:33:47.110
John Griffith, suffering from

714
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:50.442
a case of angina was instructed by his doctor

715
00:33:50.442 --> 00:33:53.149
to be tested by a cardiologist.

716
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:56.719
<v ->And, he came out from the angiogram with a very</v>

717
00:33:56.719 --> 00:33:57.987
somber expression on his face

718
00:33:57.987 --> 00:33:59.588
and he said, I have some news for you

719
00:33:59.588 --> 00:34:01.657
that you're not gonna like to hear.

720
00:34:01.657 --> 00:34:03.496
He says, you have five blockages

721
00:34:03.496 --> 00:34:07.797
in your arteries and you have an aneurysm in the aorta.

722
00:34:07.797 --> 00:34:09.599
And he said, you're not to leave the hospital until

723
00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:13.136
we have surgery.

724
00:34:13.136 --> 00:34:15.921
The surgery didn't go as well as expected.

725
00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:17.908
I was supposed to be out in three to five days

726
00:34:17.908 --> 00:34:20.616
and I saw three roommates had passed through

727
00:34:20.616 --> 00:34:23.279
my room before I was able to leave.

728
00:34:23.279 --> 00:34:26.149
And I continued to have problems.

729
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:30.354
Blood clots and a feeling of total disorientation

730
00:34:30.354 --> 00:34:33.523
and I just, things weren't right.

731
00:34:33.523 --> 00:34:35.054
Doctors said we're gonna have to keep testing

732
00:34:35.054 --> 00:34:36.800
and find out what's wrong.

733
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.417
Over the next 18 months,

734
00:34:38.417 --> 00:34:42.265
I had six surgeries and I didn't feel

735
00:34:42.265 --> 00:34:44.534
like I was ever going to leave that hospital

736
00:34:44.534 --> 00:34:48.171
I felt that

737
00:34:48.171 --> 00:34:51.000
this was gonna be the termination

738
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.313
of my ministry, termination of my life.

739
00:34:55.313 --> 00:34:58.548
And, the doctor came in

740
00:34:58.548 --> 00:35:00.950
and he said,

741
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:03.706
we've done all we can do.

742
00:35:03.706 --> 00:35:06.789
That, there's nothing more we can do

743
00:35:06.789 --> 00:35:09.058
but turn it over to your body

744
00:35:09.058 --> 00:35:12.328
and let your body work on it.

745
00:35:12.328 --> 00:35:16.132
I wasn't comfortable with that and so I

746
00:35:16.132 --> 00:35:19.636
I started praying... the room got very quiet

747
00:35:19.636 --> 00:35:21.718
very still

748
00:35:21.718 --> 00:35:23.774
and the head nurse came in.

749
00:35:23.774 --> 00:35:26.342
She had been in to see me

750
00:35:26.342 --> 00:35:29.585
every 15 to 20 minutes

751
00:35:29.585 --> 00:35:34.194
and she stood alongside of me

752
00:35:34.194 --> 00:35:37.617
and she said, I could remember her words so clearly.

753
00:35:37.617 --> 00:35:40.890
She said, just relax

754
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:44.647
She said, I know everything will be all right.

755
00:35:44.647 --> 00:35:48.545
And she put her hand on my right arm

756
00:35:48.545 --> 00:35:50.766
and began to stroke it

757
00:35:50.766 --> 00:35:54.740
and she said, you will be okay.

758
00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:59.275
We're in control of what's happening to you.

759
00:35:59.275 --> 00:36:02.345
And I began to feel warm

760
00:36:02.345 --> 00:36:06.929
a sense of wholeness came over me.

761
00:36:06.929 --> 00:36:09.520
And I didn't hear any other voices

762
00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.921
other than hers, was saying and reassuring me

763
00:36:11.921 --> 00:36:15.292
that everything was gonna be all right.

764
00:36:15.292 --> 00:36:18.294
And after a period of I don't know how long

765
00:36:18.294 --> 00:36:19.633
it was a very short time

766
00:36:19.633 --> 00:36:23.149
she said I'm gonna go call the doctor.

767
00:36:23.149 --> 00:36:25.201
I want the doctor to come in and look at you

768
00:36:25.201 --> 00:36:27.169
and so the doctor came in and

769
00:36:27.169 --> 00:36:29.839
and he said, I don't know what's happened

770
00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:33.842
but, he said, you've made a sudden turn.

771
00:36:33.842 --> 00:36:38.782
And he said, I think you've passed the crisis.

772
00:36:38.782 --> 00:36:43.156
And I said, well, I knew that too.

773
00:36:43.156 --> 00:36:45.644
And he said, how did you know that?

774
00:36:45.644 --> 00:36:50.492
And I said, because the angel touched me.

775
00:36:50.492 --> 00:36:53.162
And he laughed and he said, what do you mean?

776
00:36:53.162 --> 00:36:54.001
And I said, no,

777
00:36:54.001 --> 00:36:57.700
the angel who was present in my room touched me

778
00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.169
and that made all the difference.

779
00:37:00.169 --> 00:37:03.439
It was the nurse who had touched me.

780
00:37:03.439 --> 00:37:07.576
And after I began to feel stronger, she

781
00:37:07.576 --> 00:37:10.613
I told her what had happened

782
00:37:10.613 --> 00:37:13.116
and she said, you mean you thought I was an angel?

783
00:37:13.116 --> 00:37:14.617
And I said, no,

784
00:37:14.617 --> 00:37:18.277
I knew you were an angel.

785
00:37:18.277 --> 00:37:21.631
And that God was working through you

786
00:37:21.631 --> 00:37:25.895
to bring me back from wherever I was headed.

787
00:37:25.895 --> 00:37:28.531
And she was kind of overwhelmed by it all

788
00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:32.405
and she said, I've never had this experience before.

789
00:37:32.405 --> 00:37:34.804
And I said, well I can assure you I never have either.

790
00:37:34.804 --> 00:37:37.450
(laughs)

791
00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:40.142
But I said, I believe very strongly that

792
00:37:40.142 --> 00:37:43.658
you were God's angel for me

793
00:37:43.658 --> 00:37:45.638
and I will forever thank you,

794
00:37:45.638 --> 00:37:48.323
for what you've done.

795
00:37:53.757 --> 00:37:55.509
<v Voiceover>An angel speaks,</v>

796
00:37:55.509 --> 00:37:59.829
a human listens and responds

797
00:37:59.829 --> 00:38:02.665
maybe we should all learn to listen more carefully

798
00:38:02.665 --> 00:38:05.569
to these messengers of God.

799
00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:08.837
But what about those other messages?

800
00:38:08.837 --> 00:38:13.436
Those sudden inclinations to do something bad?

801
00:38:13.436 --> 00:38:15.978
We can't escape the truth

802
00:38:15.978 --> 00:38:18.647
the presence of evil seems to be alive and well

803
00:38:18.647 --> 00:38:21.634
across the face of the earth.

804
00:38:21.634 --> 00:38:25.572
Just where are the good angels in all of this?

805
00:38:25.572 --> 00:38:28.525
<v ->People wonder if there are indeed angels</v>

806
00:38:28.525 --> 00:38:33.162
who are here protecting us why then do we have

807
00:38:33.162 --> 00:38:37.700
such..such things as children who starve to death

808
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.536
and events like the Holocaust

809
00:38:39.536 --> 00:38:41.638
how could these things happen when angels are

810
00:38:41.638 --> 00:38:45.274
supposed to protect us and to watch over us?

811
00:38:45.274 --> 00:38:49.331
I'd like to remind us of something very simple

812
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:53.315
and that that is that this is an evil that human beings

813
00:38:53.315 --> 00:38:56.320
inflict upon one another.

814
00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.389
<v ->So I guess when we ask that kind of a question</v>

815
00:38:59.389 --> 00:39:01.290
what we're doing in a sense is we're making

816
00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:03.342
a judgement about God.

817
00:39:03.342 --> 00:39:04.626
You know, what kind of a God

818
00:39:04.626 --> 00:39:07.096
would permit this kind of thing to happen?

819
00:39:07.096 --> 00:39:08.564
And in this case you're asking also

820
00:39:08.564 --> 00:39:10.265
the question about angels.

821
00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:12.768
How could angels permit this to be?

822
00:39:12.768 --> 00:39:16.039
And yet, I wonder if in the long run

823
00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:17.973
we ourselves as humans will not also

824
00:39:17.973 --> 00:39:20.149
have to face that same judgement.

825
00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:23.225
How could we as human beings let these kinds of things

826
00:39:23.225 --> 00:39:24.913
be happening in our world.

827
00:39:24.913 --> 00:39:26.949
<v ->What if nothing bad ever happened?</v>

828
00:39:26.949 --> 00:39:29.518
What if everything was perfect?

829
00:39:29.518 --> 00:39:34.491
There was never any bad people no negativity

830
00:39:34.491 --> 00:39:38.928
Everybody had just enough money no crimes happened,

831
00:39:38.928 --> 00:39:39.942
everything would be handed to

832
00:39:39.942 --> 00:39:42.165
you wouldn't learn anything.

833
00:39:42.165 --> 00:39:43.566
Nobody would learn anything,

834
00:39:43.566 --> 00:39:45.701
you wouldn't have to work for anything.

835
00:39:45.701 --> 00:39:47.870
And I believe that that's why we're here is just

836
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:49.478
simply a stopping point

837
00:39:49.478 --> 00:39:53.009
for a school if you will

838
00:39:53.009 --> 00:39:57.146
and sometimes bad things have to happen

839
00:39:57.146 --> 00:40:00.379
but there will... something good will come out of that.

840
00:40:00.379 --> 00:40:03.185
<v ->We are here to love one another</v>

841
00:40:03.185 --> 00:40:06.622
and to learn the ways of peace.

842
00:40:06.622 --> 00:40:10.459
If God were to intervene directly

843
00:40:10.459 --> 00:40:13.229
say to directly send an angel to put

844
00:40:13.229 --> 00:40:17.317
food into a child's mouth that is

845
00:40:17.317 --> 00:40:20.569
not teaching us that we have a responsibility

846
00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:23.105
to that child, if that child is to be fed

847
00:40:23.105 --> 00:40:25.208
it's to come from our hands.

848
00:40:25.208 --> 00:40:27.676
<v Voiceover>Angels don't want the attention on them.</v>

849
00:40:27.676 --> 00:40:30.079
They want us focused beyond them

850
00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:32.282
their pointing to heaven

851
00:40:32.282 --> 00:40:33.783
and they're disappearing, they're saying,

852
00:40:33.783 --> 00:40:35.817
that's where the peace is coming from,

853
00:40:35.817 --> 00:40:38.024
that's where you have to start.

854
00:40:38.024 --> 00:40:39.888
So you've got to put God back

855
00:40:39.888 --> 00:40:42.124
and then everything else will make sense

856
00:40:42.124 --> 00:40:44.193
and everything else will flow from that.

857
00:40:44.193 --> 00:40:45.829
<v Voiceover>So angels aren't looking</v>

858
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:48.131
for praise or adoration.

859
00:40:48.131 --> 00:40:50.300
Some remarkable insights on this subject

860
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.302
are offered by Betty Eadie

861
00:40:52.302 --> 00:40:54.037
whose book, Embraced by The Light,

862
00:40:54.037 --> 00:40:56.039
is a best-seller.

863
00:40:56.039 --> 00:40:57.693
Betty wrote the book following

864
00:40:57.693 --> 00:40:59.908
an extensive near death experience

865
00:40:59.908 --> 00:41:01.967
where she picked up some definite opinions

866
00:41:01.967 --> 00:41:05.875
about an angel's place in human affairs.

867
00:41:05.875 --> 00:41:09.318
<v ->But don't focus on angels.</v>

868
00:41:09.318 --> 00:41:10.886
If you focus on angels

869
00:41:10.886 --> 00:41:14.289
you are short changing yourself.

870
00:41:14.289 --> 00:41:15.891
Many people have come up to me

871
00:41:15.891 --> 00:41:17.493
and they said, Betty I wanna learn how to

872
00:41:17.493 --> 00:41:20.109
get in contact with my angels.

873
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:21.563
Why?

874
00:41:21.563 --> 00:41:25.630
Why do you want to learn who the messenger is?

875
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:31.073
Learn who God is.

876
00:41:31.073 --> 00:41:33.408
I don't even know who my angels are.

877
00:41:33.408 --> 00:41:35.344
I don't remember their names.

878
00:41:35.344 --> 00:41:38.047
I don't try to know what their names are,

879
00:41:38.047 --> 00:41:40.549
I just know that they're there.

880
00:41:40.549 --> 00:41:43.886
I want my relationship to be pure

881
00:41:43.886 --> 00:41:46.422
and anything that you put between you

882
00:41:46.422 --> 00:41:48.791
and God

883
00:41:48.791 --> 00:41:52.928
will put a distance, a space.

884
00:41:52.928 --> 00:41:55.998
Don't put angels there.

885
00:41:55.998 --> 00:42:00.335
<v Voiceover>So again, angels seem to be God's messengers</v>

886
00:42:00.335 --> 00:42:03.239
a link, offered between heaven and earth,

887
00:42:03.239 --> 00:42:06.574
as they've always been.

888
00:42:08.824 --> 00:42:11.447
As in the great stories of the past,

889
00:42:11.447 --> 00:42:14.082
many believe that angels continue to play

890
00:42:14.082 --> 00:42:17.319
an important role in our world's unfolding.

891
00:42:17.319 --> 00:42:19.788
<v ->Chances are that there are members of</v>

892
00:42:19.788 --> 00:42:21.523
your immediate family circle who

893
00:42:21.523 --> 00:42:23.359
have had these experiences,

894
00:42:23.359 --> 00:42:26.485
friends, undoubtedly people at the work place

895
00:42:26.485 --> 00:42:29.164
if you have-- at all

896
00:42:29.164 --> 00:42:30.536
but they're out there, you just don't know it.

897
00:42:30.536 --> 00:42:33.569
Because people are reluctant to

898
00:42:33.569 --> 00:42:35.504
to tell these stories out in public

899
00:42:35.504 --> 00:42:36.639
for fear of ridicule.

900
00:42:36.639 --> 00:42:39.442
<v ->Now we're opening up to an era</v>

901
00:42:39.442 --> 00:42:41.877
where potentially we won't

902
00:42:41.877 --> 00:42:44.744
have to depend on the belief,

903
00:42:44.744 --> 00:42:47.724
disbelief thing anymore.

904
00:42:47.724 --> 00:42:50.522
That now we can talk openly

905
00:42:50.522 --> 00:42:53.002
about our spiritual experiences.

906
00:42:53.002 --> 00:42:55.091
<v ->It helped me a great deal, talking to other people</v>

907
00:42:55.091 --> 00:42:58.026
and share with them what had happened to us

908
00:42:58.026 --> 00:43:01.096
and they would say, it's all right,

909
00:43:01.096 --> 00:43:05.334
we've had a similar experience, you're not crazy.

910
00:43:05.334 --> 00:43:08.070
<v ->I can remember how I felt</v>

911
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.840
when I first began to seriously entertain the idea that

912
00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.543
a spiritual realm exists.

913
00:43:13.543 --> 00:43:14.844
Because I had been an agnostic,

914
00:43:14.844 --> 00:43:16.412
I thought the physical was all there was,

915
00:43:16.412 --> 00:43:18.947
I thought the universe was just a big, cold, dead,

916
00:43:18.947 --> 00:43:21.216
random machine that came into being by accident

917
00:43:21.216 --> 00:43:22.318
and we're just little cogs

918
00:43:22.318 --> 00:43:24.153
and it doesn't make any difference what happens

919
00:43:24.153 --> 00:43:26.722
what we do, you know we're here for a few

920
00:43:26.722 --> 00:43:28.156
brief moments on the stage

921
00:43:28.156 --> 00:43:31.193
and then we make our exit into oblivion.

922
00:43:31.193 --> 00:43:34.496
And suddenly I began coming across circumstantial evidence

923
00:43:34.496 --> 00:43:37.433
not scientific proof, but circumstantial evidence

924
00:43:37.433 --> 00:43:38.958
that that was not the case.

925
00:43:38.958 --> 00:43:40.936
That we live in a universe of purpose

926
00:43:40.936 --> 00:43:42.691
a universe of intelligence

927
00:43:42.691 --> 00:43:44.806
and a universe that seems, appears to have been planned

928
00:43:44.806 --> 00:43:46.541
by an unseen hand.

929
00:43:46.541 --> 00:43:49.578
This is more than just a subject to dwell on

930
00:43:49.578 --> 00:43:54.310
and pass on because if this is true

931
00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.964
if angels really do exist then a spiritual realm exists

932
00:43:56.964 --> 00:43:58.564
and we have a purpose and a plan

933
00:43:58.564 --> 00:44:00.793
that says something to us.

934
00:44:00.793 --> 00:44:03.358
<v ->Faith.</v>

935
00:44:03.358 --> 00:44:07.229
That all sums it up, without that

936
00:44:07.229 --> 00:44:09.632
you can't get anywhere.

937
00:44:09.632 --> 00:44:13.369
<v ->Being able to yield myself</v>

938
00:44:13.369 --> 00:44:17.206
to the governing of God

939
00:44:17.206 --> 00:44:21.677
is the empowerment that an angelic presence gives to me.

940
00:44:21.677 --> 00:44:25.881
To be able to believe that God is so concerned about

941
00:44:25.881 --> 00:44:29.585
me and you and all of us

942
00:44:29.585 --> 00:44:33.222
that God comes presently into each of our lives

943
00:44:33.222 --> 00:44:36.859
and if we're open enough to receive that presence

944
00:44:36.859 --> 00:44:39.962
then we become so much more open to each other.

945
00:44:39.962 --> 00:44:42.164
And it's that angelic presence that binds us

946
00:44:42.164 --> 00:44:45.434
into one another's lives and we're whole

947
00:44:45.434 --> 00:44:48.036
and at peace.

948
00:44:48.036 --> 00:44:49.338
<v Voiceover>And might the angels'</v>

949
00:44:49.338 --> 00:44:52.608
final and finest message be

950
00:44:52.608 --> 00:44:55.844
you are not alone.

951
00:44:55.844 --> 00:44:58.014
No matter where you travel

952
00:44:58.014 --> 00:45:01.000
or where you end your days,

953
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.654
Could it be that an angel hovers ever near?

954
00:45:05.654 --> 00:45:08.390
Ever offering the great peace

955
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.393
that comes with believing.

956
00:45:11.393 --> 00:45:15.513
