If you want to
get a photo,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%

Hey Linda,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Tammy,
what happened?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:90%
You're not checked in.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't you
checked in?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:90%
-- I'm not there yet.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
-- What do you mean
you're not there yet?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm still on the road.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
-- You're not
in Phoenix?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:90%
-- No.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Well then,
where are you?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:90%
-- I don't know.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Are you lost?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:90%
-- No, I'm not lost...

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know
where I am.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny, get down.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey, young man.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Where are you
visiting from?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:90%
San Diego.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:90%
That's in California.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Is that your friend?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:84%
No, that's my
brother Jeremy.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:90%
He's 12.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:90%
You want a balloon?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:90%

Aw, I got it,
let's go.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Guys, come on.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:90%
What about you?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you want
a balloon? Yeah?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Can we go in
a helicopter?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:90%
No, absolutely not.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Gimme my phone.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Oh hey!
I'm in Sedona.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:90%
-- What?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:90%
-- I'm in Sedona.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Sedona?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Okay well, at least you're
in the right state.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Bye, Mom.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Bye, sweetie.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Why are you running
so far behind?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Wait a minute, Tammy,
did you stop in Vegas?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:84%
-- I...so what are
you calling about?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Well, I just talked
to Al Brady.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Did you get the message
he left you this morning?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:84%
-- I didn't check
my messages yet.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Well, Beckwith has to
leave tomorrow morning.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:90%
-- What? Oh crap!

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
He's canceling
our meeting?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
-- No, no...he wants to
do it tonight instead.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Tonight?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
-- And he's calling in his
entire Board of Directors.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Seriously?
-- Seriously.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:90%
(brakes screeching)

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, sorry!

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:90%
-- I have to call you back.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:90%
What are you thinking?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:90%
He's fine.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:90%
(horn honking)

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:90%
What is wrong with you?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:84%
You know you're not supposed
just run out into the street!

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:90%
What do we do first?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Look both ways.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:90%
And wait for us.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I did that!

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Alright, alright,
alright.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Alright, come on,
let's go.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Come on!

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey!

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Of course I'm ready!

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Shit, does it have
to happen today?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
This is too important for
something to go wrong.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000 align:middle line:90%
I want that contract.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Oh, stop it.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I thought you were ignoring
your birthday anyway?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Ignoring it doesn't mean
it's not still cursed.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:90%
-- You're being ridiculous.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Okay, how much further
do you have to go?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:78%
Will that be all?
Um, how far are
we from Phoenix?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:90%
It's about two hours.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:90%
That's it?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
-- I'm a couple
hours away.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Okay good.
Keep it.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Listen I'm gonna
get an earlier flight,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000 align:middle line:84%
probably get in not long
after your spa appointment

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:84%
which you better be
there on time for.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:90%
-- I've got plenty of time.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:84%
-- It's my gift to you and
it's already paid for

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:90%
so don't you dare miss it.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:84%
The way you're acting you
could really use that massage.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
-- What's that
supposed to mean?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I could've driven,
you know?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm just checking
my messages.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You're running
down my battery!

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I was
listening! Stop!

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:84%
How'd we ever survive
before the cell phone?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Okay Ed, you talk on your
phone just as much as I do.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh please.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I, who doesn't even
have their phone here?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah well, it's good
to have one with you.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you don't
have to answer it

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle line:84%
every do-dang
time rings.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Okay, well, if I don't answer it
now then they'll keep calling

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm gonna have to
call them back, so it's just

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000 align:middle line:84%
one less thing for me to
have to deal with later.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, it wouldn't
hurt to just turn it off.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Focus on your
family for a while.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:90%
That's not fair.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Alright?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
I'm doing?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:84%
What's the point
of a vacation?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle line:84%
It's your birthday,
for crying out loud.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey, slow down,
slow down.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Quick, stop the car,
stop the car.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Boys, boys, look.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Where?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Right up there
on the left.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle line:90%
What is it, Daddy?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Pigs?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:90%
I want to see.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:90%
They must be javelinas.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Are they mean?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:84%
No!
Yes...yep.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Okay, so now we're
gonna be flying over to

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Boynton Canyon
and on the right,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:84%
coming up, you can
see the backside of --

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:90%
(engine sputtering)

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:78%
It's alright.
Everything's fine,
everything's fine.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Okay, Sam, we're gonna have
to come back to the airport.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got some sort
of engine problem.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Aw, come on!

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Alright, I'll turn
the ringer off, okay?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you just
leave it the car?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Leave your phone
in the car...I dare you.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:90%
What if we need it?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Why would we need it?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You want me to
leave it in the car?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:72%
That's gonna make
you happy?
That will make
me very happy.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay...in the car.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000 align:middle line:84%
-- No?
-- Yes.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Here it goes!

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughter)

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love you.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Okay, that's,
put me down.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay, here we go.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Do we have to do this?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Can we go back
to the lodge?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Where's mine?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I can do it.
Alright.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Whoa!

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:90%
(Native American chanting)

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Ah, Gordy?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:90%
I think you're too low.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Yeah I, I know I'm
too low, I'm trying to...

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey man, I've got like
two seconds here,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000 align:middle line:84%
call the police department, tell
them to clear 89A for me.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:90%
-- What?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000 align:middle line:90%
(engine sputtering)

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Message 11.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Tammy, it's Al Brady with
Beckwith Enterprises,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle line:84%
the boss man has to leave
for New York tomorrow

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
morning and wants
to know if you can do

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:90%
your pitch this evening.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:17.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:90%
What the --

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:90%
(sirens blaring)

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:90%
(engine sputtering)

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:90%
You okay?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you!

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Ah, there you go.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Boo!

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, alright,
you got me.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey, can we go to that alien
restaurant again tonight?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle line:84%
No, do you remember
what today is?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna take daddy
someplace special.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Please? I want to
play the video game.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:90%
It's so cool.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Maybe tomorrow.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Alright, give me
your hand.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:90%
I can do it.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, I know,
just give me your hand.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Give me your hand.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Hi, this is Tammy
Johnson, I need to

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000 align:middle line:84%
cancel an appointment
at the spa.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, no it's for a massage,
a couple other things at 1:00.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm not
gonna be there.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Can you handle that?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:84%
No, but don't cancel
the reservation,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
just cancel
the appointment.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:90%
You got that?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay, thank you.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey, how's it going?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:90%
How do you think?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:90%
So how's my car?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the car's fine...
except for the axle.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Now we ain't a body shop,
so we can't do nothing about

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000 align:middle line:84%
the bumper and the dents and
scrapes on the ass end of it.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:90%
So what about the axle?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can have you on
the road tomorrow morning.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh no, no,
that won't do.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:90%
I need it fixed now.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, normally that
wouldn't be a problem

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:84%
but we got several
jobs ahead of you.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Charge me double,
I don't care.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Charge me triple, just
do what you gotta do.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, alrighty then.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, you're
at the top of the list.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:90%
How much time?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Couple hours probably.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:90%
What are you waiting for?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes ma'am, I'll get
right on it for you.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Alana, did you hear?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Alejandra just told me that
a tour plane landed on 89A.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that incredible?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000 align:middle line:84%
This lady can tell you
all about it firsthand.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh really? How so?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000 align:middle line:90%
We're fixing her car.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh you mean?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm the lucky person
said plane landed on.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh!

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000 align:middle line:90%
(squealing)

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm sorry, it just
took me off guard.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:84%
You must have been
scared to death.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm Deb Lovejoy.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Tammy Johnson.
Hi, Tammy.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So you were right there
at that exact moment.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that was?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:90%
A really crappy coincidence.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh hun, there are
no coincidences.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is in retrograde,
it started last night.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Would you like me
to do a reading?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:90%
A reading?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, an intuitive reading, no
charge under the circumstances.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000 align:middle line:84%
You mean that
physic bullshit?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm sorry, it's just that
I don't believe in that stuff.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:90%
No offense.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I don't get
offended, hun.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Listen, if you change your
mind, there's my card.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey Deb,
I just had an idea.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you have an opening?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:84%
She has like
a two-hour wait.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, I can take
you right now!

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Ladies, didn't
you hear me?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I am depressed enough
without knowing my future.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, not that!

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking
about your feet.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Mm, feet?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:90%
She does pedicures.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's perfect!

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I heard you cancel your
massage appointment

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
next best thing.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It's better!

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you have to.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:90%
It's like fate almost.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Almost?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:90%
It is fate!

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I would not mess
with fate if I were you.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
piss off the stars.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay, whatever.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It's better than
standing around here.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Your feet are in my hands.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:53.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey, be careful.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Why do you gotta
get so close?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Wow, this is beautiful.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Scott, this really
is worth a look.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Uh, yeah, okay.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:90%
That's too cool.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey Dad, can we
go climb down it?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Look, I don't understand,
there's nothing you can see

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000 align:middle line:84%
from over there that you
can't see from over here.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Boys, stand there
for a picture.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
that's a good idea.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Will you just come down here and
take a picture with your sons?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not having any fun.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Come on!

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Now you are from?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Portland.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I hear it's really
beautiful there.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:90%
It rains a lot.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's your first
time in Sedona.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah...not that
I meant it to be.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, not consciously
anyway.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Say, do you have
a restroom I can use?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Right this way.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:90%
You feel anything?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't
feel anything.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Guys, watch it so close
to the edge, please!

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:84%
What am I supposed
to be feeling?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000 align:middle line:90%
This is a vortex.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:90%
What's a vortex?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a heightened center
of spiritual energy...

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, it's what
the guy at the store said.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the guy at
the store said that?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, which guy was it?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Was it the guy dressed
like Jesus or was it

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000 align:middle line:84%
guy with the giant
Santa beard?

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It was Jesus.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:84%
It was Jesus,
I knew it.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:84%
If you can't trust Jesus,
who can you trust?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Didn't your client tell
you about the vortexes?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:84%
No, she didn't
mention vortexes.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:84%
She just said that this
place would help me

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:90%
get more connected.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Connected to what?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Your Blackberry?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:90%
My inner child.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Did she say that,
really?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Did she say those
exact words?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Jeremy, keeping an
eye on your brother?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Yes!

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:90%
They're fine.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Just let them be kids
for a little while.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be so
neurotic about it all the time.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not neurotic to
want to keep them safe.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:84%
You remember when Jeremy was
like two or three, we used to

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
go to your parents lake house
every single weekend.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:90%
You remember that?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we ever
do that anymore?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000 align:middle line:90%
That was fun.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember fun?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I remember fun and we got
two kids, we've got a house

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:84%
to pay for, you know,
we're kind of busy.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:90%
You know Charlene?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
You know her brother
who just died?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:90%
He was 40.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't 40.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
He was 40.
He wasn't 40.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he was.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000 align:middle line:90%
No, he wasn't.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.000 align:middle line:78%
He was older than that.
Yes he was, he was 40 and he
dropped dead of a heart attack!

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:90%
What's your point?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
My point is, is that you
are working yourself into

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
an early grave and if you
drop dead of a heart attack,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
it's really gonna
piss me off.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Charlene's brother
was fat.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:78%
Not that fat.
Yes he, what are you
talking about not that fat?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey listen.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying
chill, baby.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm a lot more relaxed
than I used to be.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughter)

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:90%
I am! What?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And Charlene's brother
was huge, okay?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
it looks like?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:90%
A mountain.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000 align:middle line:84%
No! What do you think
it looks like?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it looks like
an alien...look.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:84%
It looks like
a big rock to me.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000 align:middle line:90%
I want to climb it.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah right, like
you could climb it.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle line:90%
I could if I wanted to.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:84%
You can't even climb the
oak tree at Grandpa's.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So! That's not
the same.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:90%
You're too little.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not!

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you are.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Shrimp.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Daddy said to quit
calling me that.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, sorry,
mini shrimp!

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Stop it!

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling Daddy.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah whatever.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Would you like
holistic or basic?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Say what?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Holistic includes
balancing your chakras

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle line:90%
and a little reflexology.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Uh, no thank you.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Just whatever's
quickest.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Basic it is.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, your feet
are like cement.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Ouch.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:90%
See what I mean?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:90%
What's your sign?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have a guess,
I wanna see if I'm right.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I dabble a little
bit in astrology.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, my birthday's
today, so you tell me.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my goodness,
happy birthday!

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:90%
How old are you?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:90%
That I'd rather not discuss.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love birthdays.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I always feel like I made it
through another year

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and I'm still here.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:84%
They remind me of all the
mistakes I've made in my life.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, how you view it
is how you do it.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:90%
That's my motto.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000 align:middle line:90%
So were you right?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:90%
About what?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:90%
About my sign.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Would you believe
me if I said I was?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughter)

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:90%
How old is your son?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry?

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned
you had a son.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh no, you didn't.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:90%
My mistake.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, she's not sick.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Then what is it?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000 align:middle line:90%
You are pregnant.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000 align:middle line:90%
She can't be.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:90%
That's impossible.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:84%
That's impossible,
right, Tammy Jo?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:90%
(bells ringing)

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:90%
You dozed off.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:90%
That's a good thing.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:90%
(door knocking)

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Shouldn't you get that?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
No, not in the middle
of our session,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000 align:middle line:84%
disturbs the flow,
and besides, it's rude.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:90%
(door knocking)

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I think you should
answer the door.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Are you sure?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas,
what the hell?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000 align:middle line:90%
I tried calling.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000 align:middle line:90%
You didn't get my emails?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000 align:middle line:84%
You can't just show up
at my house,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:90%
I've got a client in there.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:90%
I got a job.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Nicholas.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:84%
It's with an insurance
company.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:90%
That's nice but...

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:84%
In a few weeks, I'll be able
to afford my own place.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I thought I had
made myself clear.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing everything
you told me to do.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you poor thing.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Stop that.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Now you just don't
get this, do you?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I cannot go out with someone
younger than my kids.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000 align:middle line:84%
You said that age
was just a number.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000 align:middle line:90%
You said --

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Look at me!

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't blame you for
wanting me but believe me,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000 align:middle line:84%
there are lots of girls who
would love to snag you up.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't want other girls.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, do I have to do this?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:84%
If you don't leave me alone, I'm
gonna have to call the police.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Now you don't
want that, do you?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:90%
But --

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000 align:middle line:84%
You want me to
have the flowers?

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Ah, they're lovely.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas, did you cut
these off my bush?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, go home!

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that!

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Online dating, it has been
wild and a lot of fun.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Here you go, keep it.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000 align:middle line:90%
But we haven't finished.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:84%
My car's almost ready,
I've got to get on the road.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for everything.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh wait, wait, wait.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Coast is clear.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Listen, you know, it's not
every day that your car

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
gets run off the road
by an airplane.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that everything
happens for a reason.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Good luck!

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Took more days off this
year than I did last year.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I bet you didn't
even know that.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And I take Denny to
baseball twice a week.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000 align:middle line:84%
That's something
I do for him.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:90%
For him or for you?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:90%
He loves it.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:90%
You mean you love it.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000 align:middle line:84%
We should have let him
quit when he asked us to.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you know, that's
a really good idea.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000 align:middle line:84%
You know what, any time
you start something and then

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000 align:middle line:84%
he changes his mind, he
should just be able to quit.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Come on, you know,
he's gotta know if

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000 align:middle line:84%
he starts something,
he needs to finish it.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, hang on, to be fair,
you're the one that

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:84%
talked him into it
in the first place.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Okay, well,
he likes it now.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:90%
No, he doesn't.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he does!

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And if he didn't,
he'd say something.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:84%
He did say
something, twice.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:84%
He won't say anything
now because he's afraid

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000 align:middle line:84%
he's gonna
disappoint you, again.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Just like last time.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Should be headed
back soon.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Why? We've got
all afternoon.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got a conference
call after lunch.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000 align:middle line:90%
You're kidding?

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I know
you're not.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's just...

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Never mind.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Where's my iPod?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Where is Denny?

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna kill him.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Where is he, Jeremy?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:84%
He said he was
coming back here.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Where?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Here!

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
be watching him.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:90%
He's probably hiding.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Come on, what'd I tell
you about hiding?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000 align:middle line:84%
So, wasn't it
the best?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Not exactly.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh no!
You didn't like it?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000 align:middle line:84%
She talked
way too much.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's just Deb.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:90%
How's my car?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Uh, Jay's getting
a part in Cottonwood.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000 align:middle line:90%
How long?

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:90%
About an hour.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I've gotta get the
heck out of here.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Is there a rental car
place around here?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Now come on,
I'll take you.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'll come back through
in a couple of days

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000 align:middle line:90%
and I'll get my car then.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:90%
I got it, I got it.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000 align:middle line:90%
So what's in Phoenix?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Business.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, what kind
of work do you do?

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Mind control.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:84%
You mean like
hypnosis?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:90%
No...advertising.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh cool.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you work for like a
big agency or something?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000 align:middle line:90%
I work for myself.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:90%
(ringing bell)

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I'm gonna have my own
jewelry business someday.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any advice?

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really good
at giving advice.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:90%
(ringing bell)

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Say listen, call
my cell if...Larry?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000 align:middle line:90%
No, Les.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000 align:middle line:84%
...has any issues
and do me a favor,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:84%
don't tell him that I didn't
get my car, okay, because

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:84%
he might just put off
fixing it 'til later.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000 align:middle line:90%
(ringing bell)

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Excuse me!
I'm in a hurry here.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000 align:middle line:90%
So am I.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Can't you tell?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000 align:middle line:84%
See, this is exactly why we
should have the cell phone.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh Scott, why would
we need a cell phone?

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:90%
To call for help!

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:90%
His backpack's not here.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, he probably
has it with him.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Sir! Excuse me, sir!

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Did you see a little
boy on the trail?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Little boy?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Yes, seven years old,
dark hair.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Was he with someone?

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000 align:middle line:90%
He was with us.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:90%
He might just be hiding.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I haven't passed anyone
for quite a while.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Did you guys come up from
the south trailhead?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wait.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:84%
He might have gone
back up the trail

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000 align:middle line:90%
that way to the sink hole.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000 align:middle line:90%
You're right, let's go.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Jer.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:29.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:90%
You look familiar.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000 align:middle line:90%
(shooting noises)

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Ah, my hand!

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Must use Kung Fu.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Swords.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000 align:middle line:90%
He found my gun!

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Grenade!

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Ah!

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:26.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000 align:middle line:84%
RADIO: Recapping our
top story this morning,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000 align:middle line:84%
according to
Sedona Police,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000 align:middle line:84%
in a two-vehicle
traffic accident,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000 align:middle line:84%
the second vehicle was
an open cockpit biplane.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Again, the pilot, this heroic
pilot if you ask me, made

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000 align:middle line:84%
an emergency landing
on State Route 89A.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we were coming out
of the Bashas' parking lot

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000 align:middle line:90%
right as it was landing.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I swear we were just about
to turn left right toward it.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:90%

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000 align:middle line:90%

How's Phoenix
treating you?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000 align:middle line:90%
I...love it here.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Ah, good deal.

Well, you tell Mr. Beckwith
I appreciate the opportunity.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey, one quick
question for ya.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you need any other
materials besides

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000 align:middle line:84%
the big screen for
your Power Point?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Uh, no, no,
got everything I need.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000 align:middle line:90%

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000 align:middle line:90%
We should head back.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a phone?

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's in the car.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Dad?
-- What?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000 align:middle line:84%
He was talking
about that rock.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000 align:middle line:90%
What rock?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000 align:middle line:84%
He said it looked
like an alien.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to climb it.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Which one?

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Back there.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't you say
anything before?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000 align:middle line:84%
You guys should go
to your car in case

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000 align:middle line:84%
he found his way
back there.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm Chuck.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000 align:middle line:90%
This is my cell.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Call me when
you get there.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000 align:middle line:84%
What are you
gonna do?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Look for your kid.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm a local,
I know the area.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, wait!

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't we dial
911 first?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Nah, I'm a Search
and Rescue volunteer.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming with you.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll go, too.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000 align:middle line:90%
You've done enough.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Scott!

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Keys.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000 align:middle line:90%
You're back?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I need something
from my trunk.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Um, you need a hand?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000 align:middle line:84%
No, you guys just keep
doing what you're doing.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:90%
I need my keys.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:90%
In the ignition.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000 align:middle line:84%
You left my keys
in the ignition?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you guys
work so hard!

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I can see why you mechanics
have such great reputation

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000 align:middle line:84%
for being so fast
and efficient.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000 align:middle line:84%
This is just
a wild guess,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:84%
but I'm gonna bet
that you're single.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, that is none
of your business!

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Ma'am, we can't do
anything to the car

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:84%
'til Jay gets back
with the parts.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would prefer that you do
not leave my keys in my car.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000 align:middle line:84%
That car ain't going
nowhere in the shape

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000 align:middle line:84%
it's in unless
it's on a tow truck.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000 align:middle line:84%
May I have a cup
of coffee please?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000 align:middle line:90%
It's organic.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Is it caffeinated?

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Um, no.
It's decaf.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you have
any real coffee?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Never mind.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Uh, sorry.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said it wouldn't be
good for the baby, the caffeine.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000 align:middle line:90%
You're pregnant?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:90%
About two months.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Why would you want to throw
your life away like that?

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a coffee shop
around the corner.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000 align:middle line:90%
(phone ringing)

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Is that him?

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Can I talk to him?

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Did you find him?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000 align:middle line:90%
No, he's not here.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Now what should
he do now?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Tell him to stay there
in case he shows up.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Just stay there.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Alright...bye.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Jeremy, get down.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000 align:middle line:90%
This isn't funny!

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000 align:middle line:84%
You come out right now or
you're gonna be in big trouble!

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey Scott.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000 align:middle line:84%
What kind of shows
is he wearing?

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know,
hiking shoes.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Are they Merrells?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah...

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:12.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:38:43.000 --> 00:39:08.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I've decided not
to tell your father.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It's too much,
it would kill him.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000 align:middle line:84%
By the time he gets back
from his Cambodia tour,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:84%
this will all be over with
so there's really no point.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me?

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Is this chair
being used?

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:90%
No, go ahead, take it.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, for God's sake.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:35.000 align:middle line:78%
What?
Oh, not you,
I'm sorry...Claire.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Come on, you should sing
with me, just sing with me.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Come on,
you know the tune!

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000 align:middle line:90%
You know it!

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Is she crazy?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, it kind of depends on
who you ask around here but...

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000 align:middle line:84%
SINGING:
Happy birthday to you!

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000 align:middle line:84%
...We do call her
Claire De Lune.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Seriously?

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you kind of have to
love the old nuisance.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Huh...

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000 align:middle line:90%
What about them?

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000 align:middle line:90%
They crazy, too?

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, they are checking to
see if the legend is true.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000 align:middle line:90%
What legend?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000 align:middle line:84%
You see, the artist who sculpted
that statue used great detail.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000 align:middle line:90%
What kind of detail?

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Left nothing up to
the imagination.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000 align:middle line:90%
You are so lying.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Uh, now why
would I do that?

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a
good draw, smart.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it is good
for business, but...

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay, so admit it.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000 align:middle line:84%
You're just gonna have
to go see for yourself.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Pierce.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Tammy.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet ya.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh!

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Let me help you.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll get it.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000 align:middle line:90%
(phone ringing)

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Let me help ya here.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000 align:middle line:84%
-- Bet ya never thought
you'd hear from me again.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Who is this?

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:84%
-- It's your half
night stand.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000 align:middle line:84%
You know the one
you ditched.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, Brett.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Ben.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Ben, hi!

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle line:90%
-- How are you?

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Uh, I'm a little
frustrated right now.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000 align:middle line:84%
No, no, you didn't
do anything.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm, it's, um...

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Are you okay?
Did you get my note?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000 align:middle line:84%
-- You forgot
your necklace.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Shit.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:84%
I thought you
might like it back.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000 align:middle line:84%
How about I send it to
the address on the card?

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Uh, yeah, please.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll get you
a FedEx number.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh...my...God!

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Are you freaking
kidding me?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Does he have
water with him?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Drink.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000 align:middle line:90%
What a minute.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000 align:middle line:84%
You know what,
I'm not sure.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000 align:middle line:90%
What if he ran out?

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000 align:middle line:90%
He's still okay.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Then why'd you ask?

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to get all
the information I can.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000 align:middle line:90%
It's his.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, excuse me.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Have either of you seen
any car keys around here?

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000 align:middle line:84%
No sorry,
we just got here.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you mind if I look?

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Sure.
Thank you.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:06.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen
any keys?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I've lost them
in this area.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I've seen them.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no problem.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I also see your aura.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you
something.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000 align:middle line:84%
When was the last time you
had a complete aura cleanse?

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen my keys?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I see keys, but
before you see keys,

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000 align:middle line:84%
you must see
yourself!

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:33.000 align:middle line:78%
Look at you!
What you need is this
chakra blaster necklace.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000 align:middle line:84%
This vortex charged beauty
could be yours,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and not only will you find
the keys to your car,

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000 align:middle line:84%
you'll find the keys
to your karma.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, for God's sake,
I am in a crisis here!

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000 align:middle line:84%
How about
a metaphysical?

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Perry!

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Perry? Perry?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000 align:middle line:84%
After all we've been through,
you forgot my name?

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:90%
It's Pierce, darling.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry Pierce.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000 align:middle line:90%
I lost my keys.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody
turned them in?

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Is that the best excuse
you can come up with?

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000 align:middle line:90%
She can't resist me.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I am serious!

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000 align:middle line:84%
No, the unfortunate truth
is no, I haven't seen them.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody
seen any keys?

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000 align:middle line:84%
No, but I'd be glad to help you
as soon as I can get a break.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, never mind.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Never mind!
Forget it!

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Excuse me,
excuse me.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen a
little boy up there?

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Today?

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just now, recently.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen much of
anyone up there today.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000 align:middle line:90%
What does he look like?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh here, hang on.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000 align:middle line:90%
That's him.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Ah, cute.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Yours?

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:40.000 align:middle line:84%
How old is he?
He's seven.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, somebody's out there
looking for him I hope.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, no, I'm just, I'm just

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000 align:middle line:84%
waiting here in case
he comes back.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Okay, well, I'll head up
there and look for him.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh...um...

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a number
I can call?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000 align:middle line:84%
You have a phone
on you?

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000 align:middle line:84%
You should always have
a phone out here with you.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, apparently.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Okay, um...okay,
that's my number.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Just call me if you
see anything, okay?

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000 align:middle line:90%
What's his name?

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000 align:middle line:90%
His name's Denny.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Okay.
Thank you!

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:08.000 align:middle line:84%
You're welcome.
No, really thank you!

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:31.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000 align:middle line:90%
(snake rattling)

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000 align:middle line:84%
One time this guy was out
by himself, fell off a cliff,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000 align:middle line:84%
broke both his legs,
couldn't move so he was

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000 align:middle line:84%
stranded there
for like 24 hours --

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Alright, you know what,
I really don't need

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000 align:middle line:84%
to hear about this
right now, okay?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Lawyer.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Corporate.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Cool, man.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000 align:middle line:84%
You must make
a lot of money.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Huh...not enough.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000 align:middle line:90%
You like it?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Used to.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Not anymore?

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Not so much.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Then why do you do it?

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:31.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000 align:middle line:90%
(leaves rustling)

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000 align:middle line:90%
(snorting)

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:49.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000 align:middle line:84%
How can you not have
an extra set of keys?

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't keep extra
keys at this facility.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the stupidest thing I've
ever heard in my whole life!

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000 align:middle line:84%
All keys are kept with the car,
ma'am, it's standard policy.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Little scratch, no problem;
big scratch, we charge ya.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey! What am I
supposed to do now?

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Have you tried
looking for the keys?

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Bon voyage.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay, okay.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000 align:middle line:84%
You know what, get
me another damn car.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to, Ms. Johnson,
if I had one.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000 align:middle line:90%
What, what?

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000 align:middle line:84%
No, you're not
seriously telling me

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000 align:middle line:84%
this is the last
car you've got?

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm telling
you, seriously.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000 align:middle line:90%
No! No! No!

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Look, this is a small town,
it's not like we keep

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000 align:middle line:84%
an endless supply
of cars, okay?

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000 align:middle line:84%
This week has been
extraordinarily busy.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000 align:middle line:90%
That's our last one.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Wait! Wait!

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000 align:middle line:90%
I want that car!

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Now, Ms. Johnson.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Give me that car!

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so!

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000 align:middle line:90%
You call him right now.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Now you calm down!

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Give me that number.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000 align:middle line:84%
No, no, hey no!
I don't think so!

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Give me that number!
Ma'am!

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I want you to call
that man right now!

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000 align:middle line:84%
That is not
gonna happen.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I got a couple of cars
coming in this afternoon.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I promise the first
one back is yours.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:00.000 align:middle line:78%
What are you, an idiot?
Have you not been
listening to me?

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I need to leave
town now!

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Listen ma'am,
I might be an idiot,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not the one
who lost your keys.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Alana, get me
the hell out of here.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Right now!

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Ah wait,
wait a minute.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000 align:middle line:90%
We're really high up.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You're not good
with heights?

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Look, is there any other
way that we can get,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000 align:middle line:84%
can we go around
like another --

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000 align:middle line:90%
No, no he says.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh God!

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:01.000 align:middle line:84%
No, no,
I'm okay.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not really
feeling that good about this.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I think we should
call for help now.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we circle up
around that way first?

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Ah, shit!
Ah, shit!

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Shit!

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000 align:middle line:90%
You want a Band-aid?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000 align:middle line:90%
You have one?

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Here...

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000 align:middle line:90%
What's this for?

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Snake bites.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000 align:middle line:84%
You see the band-aids
in there?

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000 align:middle line:84%
You have snakes
out here?

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't you
mention that before?

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000 align:middle line:90%
This is Arizona.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
call someone.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry, you don't see
snakes out here too often.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000 align:middle line:84%
He's out there by himself!
You understand?

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The chances of
him getting bit --

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Okay, I'm not taking
anymore chances.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000 align:middle line:84%
You make the call or you
give me the damn phone!

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay, okay.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:41.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Have you done
this before?

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000 align:middle line:90%
I've seen Todd do it.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000 align:middle line:84%
You two are getting
married, right?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Someday.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm kind of waiting
for my family to come around.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000 align:middle line:90%
They disapprove?

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm a PK so, you know,
cart before the horse.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000 align:middle line:90%
PK?

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Preacher's kid.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Colonel's kid.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, a rock to the
window might be faster.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000 align:middle line:90%
You're funny.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Do I look like I'm
trying to be funny?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know they have charter
flights to Phoenix from here.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now you're
trying to be funny.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I told you there's
a reason I don't fly.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000 align:middle line:90%
What about a limo?

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not leaving here without
my car because that means

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to come back for it
and once I'm out of this town,

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm damn sure
not coming back.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000 align:middle line:84%
You might wanna move
away from the car, honey.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000 align:middle line:90%
(yelling)

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God!

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
you just did that!

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000 align:middle line:90%
I almost had it.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:05.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000 align:middle line:90%
What's the hold up?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000 align:middle line:90%
It's going good.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Be done in less
than an hour.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Less than?

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Can you be
more specific?

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:21.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:27.000 align:middle line:84%
47 and a half minutes,
at the most.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Keep an eye on him.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000 align:middle line:84%
At this rate, I won't have
any time to check in

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000 align:middle line:90%
and change clothes.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll be back in 45, let
me know if it's earlier.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000 align:middle line:90%
(whistling)

00:52:44.000 --> 00:53:14.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000 align:middle line:90%
(screaming)

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're certainly not gonna
find your keys under there.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:40.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Not that it's any of my
business, but you okay?

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you are right,
it's none of your business.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, it looks like you're kind
of having a tough day

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000 align:middle line:84%
but heck,
it could be worse.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Did you hear about the tour
plane that crash-landed

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000 align:middle line:90%
on the street today?

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Now that was exciting.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000 align:middle line:84%
What is it with you
people in this town?

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's the vortexes.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000 align:middle line:90%
The vortexes?

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the vortexes.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but it sure
keeps me entertained.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:32.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Mrs. Keller!

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Hi sweetheart, your cake
is almost finished.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000 align:middle line:84%
It's darling.
Wanna see?

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000 align:middle line:84%
How do I know if my
water just broke?

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not time yet.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000 align:middle line:90%
I have more time.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Come with me.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I heard that.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000 align:middle line:90%
I heard you singing.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me?

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't singing.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000 align:middle line:90%
You're a liar.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Claire, is there something
I can help you with?

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000 align:middle line:84%
She's just like
the rest of 'em.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000 align:middle line:84%
No, Claire,
she's not, Claire.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, she is.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You're a liar,
mommy.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey!

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000 align:middle line:90%
You found my keys.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Give them to me.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Claire.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Give them to me.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:43.000 align:middle line:84%
No.
Claire, stop playing.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000 align:middle line:84%
She wants
her keys, okay?

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000 align:middle line:90%
You threw them away.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Who did I throw away?

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000 align:middle line:84%
You threw away the
keys to your heart.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.000 align:middle line:90%
You just threw them away!

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Finders keepers.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I just made a little joke.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000 align:middle line:90%
No, no!

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Somebody help me!

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000 align:middle line:84%
This woman is
trying to rob me!

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Claire, Claire!

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Don't chase her,
she'll eventually stop.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Please give me --

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000 align:middle line:84%
No, no, I'm not
gonna let you.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Claire, Claire!

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Claire, Claire.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Now Claire, just give
her the keys, Claire.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Give me the keys.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Claire!

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Come on, now.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Come on, just give
us the keys, Claire.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:47.000 align:middle line:90%
No, no, Claire -- ugh!

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Claire.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Tell me you're sorry.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Tell me you're sorry.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000 align:middle line:84%
What are you --
What are you --

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:15.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000 align:middle line:90%
I've been through enough.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Please give me the keys.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Tell me you're sorry.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Now say I love you.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Please, please...

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:50.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:15.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000 align:middle line:90%
They look nice.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to dance?

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll lead.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Back, side, side,
forward, side, side.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:52.000 align:middle line:84%
SINGING:
Happy birthday to you...

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:08.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:16.000 align:middle line:90%
(crying)

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughing)

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Tammy!

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:41.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey little girl,
you got any sunscreen?

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:50.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes you
have to tune out the world

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and listen to
Millie Schnebly.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Who?

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000 align:middle line:90%
The spirit of Sedona.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:08.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Stay on the path.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000 align:middle line:90%
(baby crying)

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000 align:middle line:90%
-- That's it.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000 align:middle line:84%
You did great,
sweetheart.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Keep breathing.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000 align:middle line:90%
-- What is it?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
-- It's a boy.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Wait!

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Where are they
taking him?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Can I see him first?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000 align:middle line:84%
-- We talked about this,
Tammy Jo.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000 align:middle line:84%
-- But Mom,
I want to see him.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000 align:middle line:90%
-- It's not a good idea.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Listening.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:32.000 align:middle line:90%
(phone ringing)

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000 align:middle line:90%
My car is ready.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Are you really psychic?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I prefer
the word intuitive.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So why do you
do pedicures?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Because I love feet.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Whoa!

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a shortcut
is allowed.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000 align:middle line:90%
(laughter)

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
What's taking
them so long?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been
that long.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000 align:middle line:84%
We should have
called earlier.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
They're coming,
don't worry.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Do me a favor, please, okay,
just stop saying don't worry.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what parents
do, right, they worry?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000 align:middle line:90%
The good ones do.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah well, the good ones
don't lose their kids

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000 align:middle line:90%
though, do they?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey, I got lost all the time.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Daddy! Daddy!

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Daddy!

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Denny!

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000 align:middle line:90%
What were you thinking?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:47.000 align:middle line:78%
Are you mad at me?
Am I mad at you?
Am I mad at you?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, you had me
scared to death, man.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not mad at you,
I'm not mad at you.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you know that?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I love you more
than anything

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000 align:middle line:84%
in the entire world,
you know that, right?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000 align:middle line:90%
You do?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000 align:middle line:90%
You okay kid?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm Chuck.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Where's Jeremy
and Daddy?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000 align:middle line:90%
They're at the car.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Daddy, what happened?

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, nothing.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Are you okay?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm okay.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:53.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000 align:middle line:90%
You good?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Alright.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Take care of
your dad, okay?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey...thank you.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000 align:middle line:90%
No sweat.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey buddy.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Listen, I was thinking
that maybe you wanna

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000 align:middle line:84%
quit baseball
for a little while.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000 align:middle line:90%
How long?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000 align:middle line:90%
As long as you want.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Would you be mad?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000 align:middle line:84%
What would you
want me to do?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I want you to do
whatever you wanna do.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Can I think about it?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:11.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I wanna thank you for helping
me with my rental car.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh sure,
it's no problem.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was an awful,
despicable, evil thing

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000 align:middle line:84%
that I said to you earlier
about your pregnancy.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
It was inexcusable
and I'm sorry.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey, it's okay.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, don't
worry about it.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Will you give me
your address?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000 align:middle line:90%
What for?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
'Cause I wanna send you
a gift, you know for the baby.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
You don't have
to do that.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Well I know I don't have to, but
email me your address, okay?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Aw, that's so sweet.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Tammy, wait.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd really like
you to have this.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000 align:middle line:90%
No, I can't.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000 align:middle line:90%
No, I've got others.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I designed it,
so it's no biggie.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000 align:middle line:90%
You designed this?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a lotus, so...

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Lotuses -- well, they
signify new beginnings.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000 align:middle line:90%
You're very talented.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
this, okay?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll see ya.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey, don't you ever
do that again, okay?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000 align:middle line:84%
No, no,
it wasn't your fault.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey...come back
in 15 years

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000 align:middle line:90%
and you've got a job.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Thanks again.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000 align:middle line:90%
You take care.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Ah! God!

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Come on,
come on.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm cutting my
hours in half.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Really?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but I'm keeping my cell
phone with me all the time.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Alright fine, you win.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Keep your cell
phone, get two.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a second
cell phone.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Great.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:06.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Well?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000 align:middle line:90%
What the hell is this?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know,
I found it

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000 align:middle line:84%
wrapped around
the propeller shaft.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000 align:middle line:90%
A balloon?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:43.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Hi, welcome to
the Red Planet.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000 align:middle line:90%
How are ya?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Starving.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000 align:middle line:84%
You came to
the right place.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Just one?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm not staying,
I need something to go.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you have something fast
like a sandwich or something?

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:53.000 align:middle line:84%
BLT, you got that?
Sure, sure.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000 align:middle line:90%
BLT coming your way.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Fries okay with that?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and the largest
cup of coffee you got.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000 align:middle line:90%
One cup of coffee.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000 align:middle line:90%
We'll have it right out.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000 align:middle line:84%
You can wait here
at the bar if you want.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Ah, do you have
a restroom?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Through the main dining
room in the back corner.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey!

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Are you stalking me?

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Pierce...hi!

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000 align:middle line:90%
You remembered.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, just eating dinner.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Alone?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, preferably not.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I can't, I gotta go,
I'm late.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Are you sure?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll save you a seat.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:12:21.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000 align:middle line:84%
What, no clever
wisecrack?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000 align:middle line:90%
You deserve better.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000 align:middle line:90%
What do I owe you?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no I got this.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000 align:middle line:84%
It's okay, I know
you're in a rush.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000 align:middle line:90%
(phone ringing)

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey Linda.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know you missed
your spa appointment.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll reschedule tomorrow.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Look, I'm gonna have to meet
you at the Beckwith Building,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm dressed and ready.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Where the hell are you?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Still on the road.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry, I'm just
running a little late.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Just running a little late?

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000 align:middle line:84%
How can you be acting
so calm right now?

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to
lighten up, okay?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000 align:middle line:90%
(brakes squealing)

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000 align:middle line:90%
(yelling)

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Are you alright?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Tammy,
what's going on?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000 align:middle line:90%
-- Everything's okay.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll call you later.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Shit!

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Is everyone okay?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Daddy, what happened?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Another car bumped
into us.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Cool, can I see?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000 align:middle line:84%
No honey,
just stay put.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I am so,
I am so, so sorry.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Ah, you know what, it's
actually, it's not that bad.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Is everybody
okay in there?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we're all fine.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Are you okay?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Wait a minute, aren't
you the one earlier?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, sorry!

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, believe it or not,
I'm a very good driver.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I've had
a day from hell.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, well, it happens.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000 align:middle line:84%
You know,
don't worry about it.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Well obviously you can see
how much of a hurry I'm in,

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000 align:middle line:90%
so can we?

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, oh I forgot a pen.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I have a pen,
I have a pen.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I really am sorry.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Happy birthday.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, don't mention it.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Please tell me you
didn't look at the year?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.000 align:middle line:84%
No, it's just that, um,
today's my birthday too, so.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Really?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, I mean, you know,
what are the chances of that?

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Where are you from?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, forget
I asked you that.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Never mind.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Sacramento.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh...

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Why do you ask?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no reason, I was just
wondering about your accent.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Kind of curious.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was
born in Texas.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Do I, I mean,
do I sound like it?

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Are you okay?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah...yeah.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I just had
a really bad day.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Dad, are you coming?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll be
right there, bud.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Guys, look.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Come on, answer,
damn you.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Any word?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
She should be here
any minute.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Great.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Beckwith,
this is Linda Miller.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Hi, so nice to
meet you, sir.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Linda, my pleasure.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to
meet Tammy.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, Tammy should
be here shortly.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Real soon.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000 align:middle line:84%
This is really nice of you,
but like Scott said,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000 align:middle line:90%
it's not necessary.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I know, but it's
the least I can do.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Thank you
for letting me.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's my mom,
excuse me.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Hey.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000 align:middle line:90%
I wanna talk to her.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Just a second.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000 align:middle line:84%
It's probably just
a birthday call.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
What's she like?
His mother?

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she's a sweetheart.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Scott's parents
are great.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, I love you, too.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Let me talk.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Hi Nama.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I know, right?

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Sort of.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000 align:middle line:84%
It's been a really
exciting day.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:46.000 align:middle line:90%
(music)

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000 align:middle line:84%
SONG: You gave me
the rain...

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000 align:middle line:84%
You gave me
the sky...

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000 align:middle line:84%
You gave me the wind
and I can finally feel it...

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Now slow it down...

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Lose that fear...

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Stay on the path
The haze will clear...

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'm hoping, waiting...

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000 align:middle line:90%
No more hesitating...

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking for it
on that open road...

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I found love
in Sedona...

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I found love where
the red rocks rise...

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000 align:middle line:84%

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Now listen up
Ignore the glare...

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It's all in the noise...
The answers are there

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Take that chance
Don't compromise...

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a gift's
in the sky...

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm done
with waiting...

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000 align:middle line:90%
No more hesitating...

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking
for ya...that miracle

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000 align:middle line:84%

the red rocks rise...

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000 align:middle line:90%
And I keep it going...

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Just be persistent
and you will know it...

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Today is here now...

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to
wait too long...

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Make it through the shadows
and you'll be strong...

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000 align:middle line:90%
With love...

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I found love...

Okay, thank you!
