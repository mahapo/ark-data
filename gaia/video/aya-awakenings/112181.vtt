middle-aged academics,

conspiratorial smile that says,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
their hallucinogenic
brew, ayahuasca.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:25.124 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.124 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca is a
plant medicine that

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
has been used by the
indigenous people of South

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.570 align:middle line:84%
America for millennia to
heal physical ailments

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and, they claim, to cleanse
and purify the spirit.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.690 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered
by the West in 1851,

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:84%
when the legendary
British botanist Richard

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Spruce explored
the Rio Negro basin

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and was introduced to the
vine by the Tukanoan Indians.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Spruce gave the vine
its scientific name,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Banisteriopsis Caapi.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:10%
In different areas
of South America,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:10%
it is also known
as yage or hoasca.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:10%
For a while in the
mid-20th century,

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:10%
chemists who isolated the
active properties of the vine

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:10%
called their
compound telepathine.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:10%


00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:10%
Research showed it contained
various harmala alkaloids,

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:10%
which are then
boiled up in a brew,

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:10%
also called ayahuasca, with
a multitude of other plants,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:10%
one being the leafy Psychotria
Viridis, which contains

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:10%
the powerful hallucinogenic
chemical, Dimethyltryptamine,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:10%
also known as DMT.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:84%
On its own, the
vine is only orally

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:90%
active at very high doses.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But it does contain potent MAO
monoamine oxidase inhibitors

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that overpower the
body's own enzymes

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:90%
and allow the DMT to potentiate.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Science has made cautious
forays into the jungle

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.090 align:middle line:84%
to study the vine in
its native setting.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:10%
Or, as with the Huasca
Project in the 1990s,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.530 align:middle line:10%
to study church
members of groups

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:10%
like the UDV, who
Ayahuasca as part

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:10%
of their synchratic
Christian jungle religion.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.700 align:middle line:84%
What they found was that
regular ayahuasca use flushed

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
the brain clean and
improved receptor sites,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
suggesting the vine could
be a medicinal goldmine.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:84%
But what science cannot explain
is the psychic effect of this

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.495 align:middle line:84%
mother of all plants--
the sense of the numinous

00:06:28.495 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual world
it reportedly opens up.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Those who drink say that each
ayahuasca journey is unique.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.860 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of the
vine comes alive.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.900 align:middle line:90%
It guides and teaches.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.186 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side,
nothing is ever the same.

00:06:46.186 --> 00:06:47.285 align:middle line:90%
Or so they say.

00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.470 align:middle line:10%
The native men and
women who safeguard

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:10%
the knowledge of the
vine, and of the spirits

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:10%
it is said to reveal, are the
curanderos and the curanderas.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:10%
Or as the West would
call them, shaman.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:10%
Their role has been that of
healer, priest, and traveler

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.770 align:middle line:10%
between worlds, acting
as intermediaries

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:10%
between the spiritual
dimension and this world,

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.840 align:middle line:10%
on behalf of their patients.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Yet the demands of the work and
the rise of Western materialism

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:84%
throughout South
America have seen a fall

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:84%
in prestige and customers
for the curanderos.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:84%
The profession,
usually hereditary,

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:84%
was in danger of extinction
before an unprecedented wave

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:84%
of Western gringos started
coming in search of ayahuasca

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:90%
and the healing it can provide.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 20 years or
so, a new gringo trail,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
this one a journey
of the soul, has

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
been blossoming in the
jungles of South America.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Seekers and thrill
seekers alike have

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:84%
been coming from the West for
a reconnection to the deeper

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:84%
reality shamanism
connects one to,

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and bringing back
amazing stories

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
of hallucinogenic trips,
healing and enlightenment.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous shamanism has quickly
become the most profitable

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.440 align:middle line:84%
business in town, and numerous
jungle lodges and retreats

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.640 align:middle line:84%
have sprung up
across South America

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:84%
to cater to the influx
of rich tourists.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:84%
This has spilled over
onto the internet,

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:84%
as hundreds of
ayahuasca websites,

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.050 align:middle line:84%
chat rooms and
forums have emerged

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:84%
to crystallize a
global subculture

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:84%
engaging with an indigenous
spiritual practice,

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and ceding it back
to the Western world.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.150 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:84%
And here I was, a 36-year-old
freelance journalist,

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:84%
reporting on an
academic style gathering

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:90%
with a pronounced twist.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It was all about
Amazonian shamanism,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:90%
with a hands-on component.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.060 align:middle line:10%
With its entrepreneurial blend
of spirituality and capitalism,

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.750 align:middle line:10%
the Second Amazonian
Shaman Conference

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle line:10%
may be the perfect
mix of paradigms.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:10%
It bills itself as a gathering
of curanderos, scientists

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:10%
and interested members
of the public who

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:10%
have a yearning for
indigenous spirituality.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:10%
Kevin is a long-haired
gringo from San Francisco,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:10%
in his late 30s, with angelic
good looks and hazel eyes.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:10%
He's been wandering
the world and learning

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:10%
about indigenous medicines
for over a decade.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Training for two years
in an intensive dieta

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:84%
with medicinal plants at the
famed Sachamama Ethnobotanical

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Gardens outside Iquitos.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Kevin had followed through
on the shaman's path

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
that I and ayahuasca
seekers like me were just

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.340 align:middle line:90%
beginning to tread.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.420 align:middle line:84%
He was a seed brother,
and in his example,

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
there was a burning promise that
if he could bridge the worlds,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.450 align:middle line:90%
we all could.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
The cultural firewall that kept
the shamanic reality separate

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:90%
from the west could be lifted.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:10%
>>In this Amazonian
system, human beings

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:10%
are trained by the
higher energetic selves

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.610 align:middle line:10%
of plants and trees.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.540 align:middle line:10%
As they enter this
process, this process

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.520 align:middle line:10%
of shamanic initiation,
if you will,

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:10%
in the Amazonian system,
basically, the higher

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.560 align:middle line:10%
energetic selves, the spirits,
if you will, of the plants

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:10%
enter into an agreement,
a relationship

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:10%
with the student,
the human student.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:90%
They work on a physical level.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:84%
We have a physical
body, but we also

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:84%
have energetic bodies
associated with the seven

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:90%
major chakras in our body.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So on an energetic level, the
higher energetic substances,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:84%
the spirits of the plants,
come and they heal us.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.070 align:middle line:90%
They remove blockages.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:84%
They clean our
soul, if you will.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.390 align:middle line:90%
They also prepare us.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:84%
They organize the lines of
energy, the rivers of light

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:90%
that flow through our body.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:90%
They untangle these lines.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they help to open
up the center so that we

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:90%
have different abilities.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.132 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the ability
to talk to plants and trees,

00:11:09.132 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
or to see different
vibrational dimensions.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:19.470 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Strange to think that
in the first decade

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:84%
of the 21st century, I'll be
heading to the Peruvian jungle

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:84%
in search of a connection
to the primal consciousness

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:90%
that indigenous wisdom revealed.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Yet in a world of global warming
and environmental collapse,

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:84%
it seemed all the more
urgent to reconnect

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:84%
with the planet
in a visceral way.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Now days, we are all
part of the story.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And getting down and
dirty in the far crevices

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness was a
prospect I was relishing.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:10%
But what was the
business of spirituality

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:10%
doing to all these
backpacking ayahuasca

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:10%
seekers that dared to journey
into the mysteries of creation?

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:10%
And what did it say about
the growing Western need

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:10%
for an authentic
reconnection to the planet?

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Ayahuasca was a mystery to me.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And I got the feeling that
many of the ayahuasca seekers

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:90%
were in the same boat.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:84%
We were all chasing the root of
the vine, eager for the secret

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:90%
she might provide.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But like children in
the ways of the spirit.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
The ayahuasca network
appears to cut across race,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:90%
social class and gender.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
A secret society
of plant worshipers

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
all united by the
common experience

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:90%
of this potent hallucinogenic.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And through them,
the ayahuasca vine

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:84%
was spreading her
tendrils across the world.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And a genuine archaic
revival was underway.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.310 align:middle line:90%
My bags were packed.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.830 align:middle line:90%
The jungle beckoned.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient mystery of
the rain-forest awaited.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.228 align:middle line:90%
I wanted in on it.

00:12:55.228 --> 00:12:58.630 align:middle line:90%

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.366 align:middle line:84%
The trail is alive with the
sound of birds, frogs, insects,

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:47.725 align:middle line:84%
and the screech of monkeys deep
inside this fecund landscape.

00:13:47.725 --> 00:14:02.320 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:84%
About 10 minutes in, we cross
over rickety log bridges

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:84%
strapped together
over a little creek.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:84%
A light rain falls, that
evaporates on our skin

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:90%
as soon as it hits.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I guess this is why they
call it the rain-forest,

I joked to my new
friend, Vance Gellert,

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:84%
as I help him lug his photo
bags through the lungs

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Vance is a photographer.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
He studied pharmacology
at university in the '60s.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:84%
He's been coming to the Amazon
off and on for three years now,

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:84%
photographing curanderos
and the native culture

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:84%
here for a book and
exhibition he's working on.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I've also roped in John
Bowman to our media cell.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:84%
A straight talking, bearded
dude from Vancouver,

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.930 align:middle line:90%
who's wise beyond his 23 years.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And you turned up back at my
hostel, armed to the teeth

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:84%
with broadcast quality audio
recording gear to tape shamans.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Soon we arrive at the ceremonial
maloca, a kilometer or so

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:90%
past the last village.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple wall-less
hut about 20 feet long,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
with a thatched roof
and wooden floorboards,

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.405 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by a forest of
eight foot tall plants.

00:15:30.405 --> 00:15:33.370 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:10%
100 meters distant, giant
palm trees tower about,

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:10%
closing off the outside world.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:84%
It looks like an alien
vista, but tonight it

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.608 align:middle line:90%
will be our home and sanctuary.

00:15:45.608 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:10%
We're drinking with Percy
Garcia, an indigenous curandero

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:10%
in his early 30s, with shining
skin, short black hair,

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:10%
and the stocky build
of native Peruvians.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.780 align:middle line:84%
He's been trained
since he was a boy

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.297 align:middle line:84%
in the world of the spirits,
and of the great plant

00:16:07.297 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:90%
medicine, ayahuasca.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Percy lights mapacho cigarettes
to chase away bad spirits.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:10%
They're filled with raw jungle
tobacco, Nicotiana rustica,

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:10%
with 18% nicotine.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.130 align:middle line:10%
It's getting towards
early evening.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:10%
And after we get settled,
Percy takes us down

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.105 align:middle line:10%
to the river 100 meters away,
to bath us in flower essences.

00:16:35.105 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Percy bathes our heads,
and blows smoke down

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
the back of our necks and
over our crown chakras.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.100 align:middle line:84%
It feels like the hot breath
of nightclub smoke machines,

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very
intimate situation.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And as I look up at Percy's
always beaming face,

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:84%
with his shiny skin
and dark black eyes,

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.330 align:middle line:84%
he still looks like
he's just stepped out

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:90%
of the World Cup football tour.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:84%
But he is also a
curandero, a healer.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
And I start to realize
the responsibility he has,

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:84%
that tonight he will lead
us through the subtle zones

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:13.406 align:middle line:90%
of the spirit.

00:17:13.406 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:20.680 align:middle line:84%
One by one, we are called
up and leave the river.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Baptized into the
ways of the jungle

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:90%
by the fading dusk light.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:39.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:84%
As we wander back to the
maloca in the crisp night air,

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:84%
its thatched frame is
lit by dozens of candles.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a fairy
house in the jungle.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.140 align:middle line:84%
We take our spots on
the floor and shake out

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.820 align:middle line:90%
our sleeping bags.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And Percy's assistant,
Carlos, explains to us

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.880 align:middle line:84%
that Percy comes from a
long line of curanderos,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.740 align:middle line:84%
in a tradition where you
were born into the role.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.659 align:middle line:84%
Percy was prepared by his
grandfather, a Banco shaman,

00:18:07.659 --> 00:18:09.200 align:middle line:84%
who started grooming
him in the plant

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:90%
medicines that the age of 10.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:84%
He started drinking
ayahuasca at 14,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and learning from other teachers
after his grandfather died,

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:22.210 align:middle line:84%
rising up to become
the village healer.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't choose to become
a curandera, Percy says.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And the few that do
will enter the science

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.456 align:middle line:84%
because they are
called by spirit.

00:18:29.456 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.060 align:middle line:84%
The night is alive with the
sounds of insects and animals,

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:84%
like a constant
hum of electricity.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Percy's ceremonial garb
is a curious mishmash

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:84%
of Western clothes
and indigenous

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:84%
bling that visually sums up the
changing nature of shamanism.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:84%
A tiger t-shirt, silk
spotted pants and sneakers,

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:84%
a feathered parrot hat with
blue, red, and yellow feathers

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.635 align:middle line:84%
offset by Christian rosary
beads and a chakapa leaf fan

00:19:03.635 --> 00:19:04.625 align:middle line:90%
in one hand.

00:19:04.625 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:10%
He sits behind a makeshift
alter, a wooden box covered

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.940 align:middle line:10%
with an intricate, geometrically
patterned cloth like those

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.000 align:middle line:10%
the Shipibo women were selling.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.570 align:middle line:84%
The visual trip reports of
the ayahuascan head-space.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:10%
The altar is covered
with ceremonial objects,

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:10%
little rainbow bead dolls,
wooden cups, and about 100

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:10%
giant mapacho cigarettes.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:10%
And last but not
least, in plastic,

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.110 align:middle line:10%
two liter San Luis
water bottles,

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:10%
a thick, dark brown liquid.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Ayahuasca.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:47.820 align:middle line:90%
The vine of souls.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca is Quechua for
vine of the dead souls.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, as a healer,

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.270 align:middle line:90%
we don't call them dead spirits.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:84%
We call them allies,
Percy explains

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.014 align:middle line:90%
through his interpreter.

00:20:07.014 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca is medicine,
he continues.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
It is strength, intelligence,
wisdom, and healing.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.710 align:middle line:84%
In this way, everything is
in accord with tradition.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:84%
While nature represents
what life is, ayahuasca is

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:90%
the mother of us all, he says.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:10%
>>You may consider
myself a teacher.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:10%
But as a matter of fact, I
consider myself another student

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:10%
from mother nature.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:56.032 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.032 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:90%
The doctors are the teachers.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.525 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.525 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Those who guide me to
perform the healing.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.690 align:middle line:10%
>>Percy doles out the
ayahuasca by torchlight.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And we drink, one by one,
going up to the altar

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and taking the medicine
in little wooden bowls.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
The brew is dark
and phlegm-life.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And like all medicines,
it tastes foul.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:84%
An earthy flavor that
hits the quick of you,

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:90%
and threatens to come up again.

01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:29.360 align:middle line:84%
this is the first time

This is the first time

It's about a

Down there, Kevin says, pointing
towards civilization below us,

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.880 align:middle line:84%
with a grand sweep
of his hand, we're

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.360 align:middle line:90%
in normal physical reality.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.970 align:middle line:84%
We have filters that
adjust our perception.

01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:17.390 align:middle line:10%

This world is a school, but
life's not just about learning.

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.590 align:middle line:90%
It's about remembering.

01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:36.040 align:middle line:90%
At one time, we knew everything.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But when we come down here,
they blank out your memory.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.870 align:middle line:84%
When you take the filters off,
with tools like ayahuasca,

01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
you see the greater
reality, he continues.

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:51.455 align:middle line:90%
The key is to remember.

01:22:51.455 --> 01:22:53.529 align:middle line:90%
Remember.

01:22:53.529 --> 01:22:54.028 align:middle line:90%
Remember.

Beneath the flesh is a spiritual
body that comes, like the Inca,

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.340 align:middle line:90%
from the sun.

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But not the sun up
there in the sky.

01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
There's another sun
that lies within,

01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and it burns with the
fire of a spiritual light.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Our souls are like emanations
from this central source.

01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:25.270 align:middle line:84%
It's where we come from,

with the universe, he says.

01:23:32.730 --> 01:23:36.820 align:middle line:84%
It refers to a new golden
era in the human experience.

01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:41.840 align:middle line:10%
The age of meeting
ourselves again.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:46.190 align:middle line:10%
And then, through the gateway
of Viracocha's crown, far off

01:23:46.190 --> 01:23:49.660 align:middle line:10%
in the sky, I
suddenly spy two birds

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:52.380 align:middle line:10%
sailing through a sea of blue.

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Two eagles, perhaps.

01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Condors.

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Or both.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.390 align:middle line:90%
They're too far away to tell.

01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:02.630 align:middle line:84%
But either way, I can
read the omen clearly.
