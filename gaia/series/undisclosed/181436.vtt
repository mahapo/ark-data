>>EMERY SMITH: My
name is Emery Smith.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:10%
ET misidentification
is not only a thing,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:10%
but it happens more
times than not.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, the
public remains unaware.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.640 align:middle line:84%
However, there are rare
instances where these events

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:90%
have been witnessed.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
These witnesses believe
they have really

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:84%
seen an extraterrestrial craft
or some mythical creature,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
but were actually witnessing
something we had created.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I'm going
to explore ET sightings

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and possible mutations
caused by us,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:84%
reverse engineering
specimens and/or craft,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.697 align:middle line:84%
with a good friend of
mine, Randy Veitenheimer.

00:00:52.697 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Randy, thanks for being
on the show with me today.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER: It's
great to see you again, Emery.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The first question
that I want to get off

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:84%
is, what do you think
about these creatures

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.349 align:middle line:84%
that people report, such as
Sasquatches and chupacabras,

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
like, are these
misidentified ETs,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.035 align:middle line:84%
or are they some
sort of mutation?

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:10%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
Actually, they don't

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:10%
have to be either one of those.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle line:10%
They could just be a
naturally occurring event,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:10%
so that we don't have to
ascribe, or assign, causality

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:10%
to either one.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:84%
The idea that there
could be present entities

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.920 align:middle line:84%
or physical forms from
places other than this Earth,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
through means that are
not clearly understood,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.200 align:middle line:90%
is definitely a potential.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of it, we have
naturally occurring phenomena.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:90%
We have deviations.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:90%
They show up all the time.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:84%
They're showing up off our
coasts because of Fukushima.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And--

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, Fukushima.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.294 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --like we
had talked about earlier,

00:01:57.294 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:84%
atomic interactions, atomic
particle interactions,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:84%
can create deviation,
mutation in human form

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:90%
or in any life form.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.099 align:middle line:84%
Some things are more susceptible
to it, plants and lower life

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And as you work your
way up, it requires

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
an increasing amount of density,
or information, or energy.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:84%
So I think we have all
three things going on.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What are some of
those examples you could maybe

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:90%
share with us?

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Bigfoot.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a great one.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:84%
The idea that there's some
existence of a group of things,

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
or people, or animal forms
that if they existed longer

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
than the last ice age
would be probable.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And then if we allow for that,
then why aren't there others?

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
We know there are
surviving bacteria or fish

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:90%
from earlier eons.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.715 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And
so the idea that there

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:84%
would be more, but also
remember that there's

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:90%
more and more humans.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:90%
There's more chance of contact.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
There's more chance
of interaction

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
then there might
have been when there

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
was very few people, either on
the planet or in the country.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:90%
So we have all three potentials.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And if we allow
for the particle,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.620 align:middle line:84%
the physical interactions
that would create or change

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.275 align:middle line:84%
mutations, now we also
have the energetic.

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:90%
We have the wave forms.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
We have cosmic waves,
energetic waves, EMF pulses,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of things
that can affect change.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest things that
came out in recent research

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:84%
is the idea of epigenetic
changes, the idea that you

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
could actually modify your
genes, your own gene structure,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and pass it on because
of traumatic events,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle line:84%
or ongoing deprivation, or heavy
pressure from emotional events,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:90%
psychic events.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:90%
So we are mutable.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And the mutations
that occur, of course,

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:84%
could be infinite,
depending on the sources

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
of the vectors of
information and energy

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that came into play that
produced the changes.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.279 align:middle line:84%
They happen for every
individual on Earth.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
We are unique compared to
the next one down the line,

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:90%
the next one born.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So mutation's going
on all the time.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at just the
range of humans in height

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:84%
or in weight, we do
have some limits because

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:90%
of the gravity on the planet.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And but maybe those limits don't
apply everywhere all the time.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.365 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we get
into anomalies.

00:04:40.365 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:84%
We are one of the
most adaptable species

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
in the universe by changing
every year and every decade.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And every lineage is
changing and mixing.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And also, the effects
of EMF and radiation.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
We're actually getting stronger,
and stronger, and stronger,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.151 align:middle line:90%
and our bodies are changing.

00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is also
happening, I think,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:84%
across the planet with animals,
and the fishes of the seas,

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
How do you think this
is misleading people,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:84%
these mutated things
that wash up on shore

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:84%
or they see something running
through an old mine shaft that

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.707 align:middle line:90%
used to be full of uranium?

00:05:22.707 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: I've
kind of looked at that.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who's
lived in New Mexico

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
or around the Navajo
reservation in Arizona,

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:84%
you'll see all these mines
with these mine tailings.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was the mining
for uranium in the '50s.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And that
ebb and flow and a lot

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:84%
of them got abandoned,
most of them.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, now, we get
contamination and the spreading

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.830 align:middle line:90%
of that material.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
The problem becomes is
in a aggregate form,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
it's not particularly
concentrated.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:84%
But once you start mining it,
it becomes more concentrated.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have these
mines, or caves, like I say,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
you can drive down
I-40 and see them.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
natural choice of animals,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.130 align:middle line:84%
birds, different things, to
maybe inhabit these spaces.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.855 align:middle line:84%
And the spaces
they're inhabiting

00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
are now have a different
radiological content than, say,

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.680 align:middle line:84%
just the open spaces
they normally inhabited.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we go to
epigenetic change.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:84%
We go to the fact that you
could create a population that

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.580 align:middle line:84%
was experiencing rapid
evolutionary growth,

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily in the concept
that it would be beneficial,

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:84%
but you could actually
start seeing deviations

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.690 align:middle line:90%
in form and behavior.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And so then we could
account for the myths

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:84%
of the Bigfoot, and chupacabra,
and things like that.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.845 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Branching off from
that from history, even--

00:06:56.845 --> 00:06:57.785 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:06:57.785 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --with Native
American Indian culture.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you see these
things, the natural reaction

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is if you do not have
a reference set that

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:84%
allows you to examine that
entity, or that animal,

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.190 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you're
looking at, then

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
you're going to throw it into
myth being the easiest way.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
collective conscience

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.510 align:middle line:84%
of myth about animals, and
spirits, and spirit animals,

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.089 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the secondary
thing would be

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.547 align:middle line:90%
to attribute it to some other--

00:07:29.547 --> 00:07:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Some other event.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --culture,
some other event, some other--

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What
events has humanity

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:84%
created that actually
could have damaged

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.395 align:middle line:84%
the planet in different ways
for these mutations to happen?

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot
of events, I think,

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:84%
that have been
under-reported, let's say.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
At one point, the
Mediterranean, back in the '60s,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
they figured out was dead,
or dying, because of all

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:90%
the chemical inputs.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, and
even in this country,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:84%
the Chicago River or
whatever caught on fire

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and we finally woke up and
created the EPA as somebody

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:90%
to pay attention to it.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
But you can have
localized where people

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.800 align:middle line:84%
discover a new plant
or something that

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.380 align:middle line:90%
has psychoactive properties.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:22.675 align:middle line:84%
Go to France in the 1600-1700s
with the yeast or whatever was

00:08:22.675 --> 00:08:23.550 align:middle line:90%
producing the bread--

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, right.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.881 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --and
made everybody crazy.

00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.385 align:middle line:90%
Only CIA calls it LSD.

00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:84%
So there's been
localized events.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:36.299 align:middle line:84%
But as far as humanity
creating events,

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:40.409 align:middle line:84%
until we entered the
chemical nuclear age,

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:41.733 align:middle line:90%
they were pretty localized.

00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:42.916 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: But it
gets into the concept,

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.420 align:middle line:84%
too, throughout history
and myth about the idea

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.459 align:middle line:84%
that a group of people could
gather together and influence

00:08:51.459 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:90%
the physical environment.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.525 align:middle line:84%
How are they
contributing to that?

00:08:56.525 --> 00:08:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: It
gets into intent.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:90%
It gets into ritual.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:84%
It gets into obviously,
the negativity

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:84%
is what we see
surrounds all that

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:84%
because the destructive force
is very capable, we would say.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
There's always an intention
behind the entire thing

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.654 align:middle line:84%
to destroy this area or this
group of people, let's say.

00:09:24.654 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.875 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Create genocide
because of a mutation.

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
Yeah, the insanity

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.040 align:middle line:84%
of acquiring other
people's territory

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:90%
is that you're going to die.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not going--

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I want what
you have, Randy.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.645 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --to
be long due forever.

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I want your watch.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It's better than mine.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:90%
And then, it's only temporary.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that somebody
else's is better,

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.610 align:middle line:84%
it's like that we would go to
the creative energy where we

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%
would say, it's better to
improve where you're at than

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.280 align:middle line:90%
to go find somebody else's.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.230 align:middle line:84%
What about UFOs,
extraterrestrials,

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:84%
things like this
where we go to sites

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and these ancient
craft made of--

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and because of the
different types

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:84%
of radiation measured
there and things like that,

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:84%
it didn't destroy
the flora and fauna.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It didn't modify it.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:18.646 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:10:18.646 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And are you aware of
any places like that around

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth that you
could talk about that's

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.340 align:middle line:90%
not too classified?

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Well, recently,
they talked about, in Brazil,

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:84%
where they have
revived, or propagated,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
what they considered to be
extraterrestrial plants.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And we know that pollen
type things exist in space

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and that they have the
ability to transverse space.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.335 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it's
fine in an environment.

00:10:48.335 --> 00:10:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: We think of
all this in physical terms.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Once you go beyond
physical terms,

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:84%
then the potential for travel,
the potential for interactions,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I call them trans-dimensional
interactions,

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.870 align:middle line:84%
trans-spatial interactions,
there's a lot of language we

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:84%
could use for it, but the
experiences all tend to have

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.040 align:middle line:84%
to be related back through our
own language, or our own myths,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.840 align:middle line:90%
or our own--

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Our own science.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --education,
our own science.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:25.717 align:middle line:84%
And using our science to try to
understand another science just

00:11:25.717 --> 00:11:26.517 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work.

00:11:26.517 --> 00:11:27.475 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Does not work.

00:11:27.475 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: I admire
everybody's efforts,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.840 align:middle line:84%
but it really would
require an open mind.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It would require an
imaginative mind.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And it would require a mind
that is open to the idea

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
that there is another way of
looking at things, that there's

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:84%
another existence beyond the
physical reality we're used to.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have all kinds of
references throughout history.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.765 align:middle line:90%
Why did they build the pyramids?

00:11:53.765 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:90%
What was the purpose?

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.975 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The biggest question
we get asked all the time.

00:11:56.975 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And if they were just trying
to create a sculpture garden,

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:84%
it's like, well, they
did a pretty good job.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:84%
But if they weren't just
creating a sculpture garden,

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask yourself that
there was some sort of purpose,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:84%
some sort of intent, and that
action was to produce a result.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:90%
And nobody's ever answered that.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:90%
But what if we use that energy?

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:90%
We know it modifies human form.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.380 align:middle line:90%
We know it modifies plant form.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Outside of Moscow,
you can find all kinds

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.697 align:middle line:84%
of fiberglass pyramids
on the research they did.

00:12:31.697 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we
thought that was too

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:90%
woo-woo to do pyramid research.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.000 align:middle line:10%
And yet, their effects on
plants, razor blades, people

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:10%
is well-documented in Russia.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:10%
They take it for granted.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.790 align:middle line:10%
So we don't even have
to go off-planet to find

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:10%
that there's other ways
of looking at things.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:84%
There's other experiences,
other ways of talking about it.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And especially, other
ways of observing it.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Because we tend to view all
UFO and ET interactions,

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.660 align:middle line:90%
they're all photonic.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:90%
I have to see a picture.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to see a--

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: A wavelength.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
--energy spectrum.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:06.965 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:06.965 --> 00:13:08.673 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That has to
do with wavelengths.

00:13:08.673 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: I'd to see
all kinds of data that is not

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.599 align:middle line:90%
exactly photonic in nature.

00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:14.765 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: A picture doesn't--

00:13:14.765 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --do justice--

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.856 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:13:16.856 --> 00:13:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --as far as
the science theory.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.646 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:13:19.646 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:90%
And particularly now.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Have you
ever seen, or heard,

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:84%
about witnesses at these
areas of maybe crash sites

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:84%
or contaminated areas that
they are saying they've seen

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.960 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials or they
were saying they've seen a--

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:45.330 align:middle line:84%
The thing about it, in
Santa Fe one evening,

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I met the son of the
rancher on whose land

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.315 align:middle line:90%
the '47 crash occurred.

00:13:53.315 --> 00:13:54.115 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:13:54.115 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And
not mention his name.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I remember
you telling me this.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:58.965 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:13:58.965 --> 00:14:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But after a few
drinks, he proceeded

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.570 align:middle line:84%
to relate what had occurred
to him and his family.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:90%
And it is anecdotal information.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:90%
You can't verify, right?

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But given the circumstances,
and the emotive content,

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and I read people,
I would say he

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:84%
was telling the truth
about being a child

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.632 align:middle line:84%
and people threatened
them with guns

00:14:21.632 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:84%
if they ever talked about
this out in the open.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.506 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, for sure.

00:14:24.506 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: So now, did
they have a real experience?

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was real
enough for them

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:84%
to experience all
the emotions and all

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:38.050 align:middle line:84%
the intellectual outcomes and
extensions of that experience.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:90%
So is that real?

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's certainly
real enough to be

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:46.810 align:middle line:84%
able to create another craft
once you've seen it, right?

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.380 align:middle line:84%
It's real enough for
Tesla, in his dreams,

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:90%
to see a complete AC motor.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.204 align:middle line:90%
And wake up, draw the diagrams--

00:14:54.204 --> 00:14:55.003 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's it.

00:14:55.003 --> 00:14:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
--and go build it.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.690 align:middle line:90%
So where was his information?

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:90%
We could call it ET information.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:84%
We could call it
other universes.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.980 align:middle line:84%
We could call it
other dimensions.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:90%
But we know it's there.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And people's insistence on
disallowing, or disavowing,

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
that information based on the
fact that they didn't see it

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:90%
is just kind of ridiculous.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And it just
represents a paradigm

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.145 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't want to
let go of the old--

00:15:22.145 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Of the old--

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --ways, the--

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:90%
The old ways.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.866 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --old ideas.

00:15:25.866 --> 00:15:27.715 align:middle line:84%
They're happy with
the reality we had.

00:15:27.715 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's easier to deal
with just day-to-day belief

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:90%
system of science.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.126 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:15:32.126 --> 00:15:35.485 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, one of the things
is resistance to change.

00:15:35.485 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.290 align:middle line:84%
We measure resistance
in electrical motors.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
We should measure
it in consciousness.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the distance
between being

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:84%
able to acquire new
technology, or to be

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
able to express it, and
create it, bring it into form,

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:84%
is much greater the greater
your resistance is to the idea.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you look around, 1961,
I'm looking up in the skies

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:90%
and I see a UFO.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I always think of them as not
unidentified flying objects,

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:90%
but unacknowledged.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Somebody knows who they are.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Someone knows what's going on.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: They're
just not telling.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting
about that is,

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:84%
this thing's clear in 40 degrees
of arc in, like, five seconds.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
you can't do that.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
available at that time.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Interesting, years later,
somebody said-- and remember,

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:84%
you didn't talk about
these things-- and somebody

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.050 align:middle line:84%
said something, I said, well,
I saw a UFO when I was young.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, who was with me
at the time, pops out and says,

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:90%
I saw it too.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And it shocked me that she
would admit to it because that's

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.160 align:middle line:84%
the paradigm that those people
who were raised prior to,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:84%
let's say, 1960, that their
paradigm didn't include that.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And our paradigm, of course,
is being conditioned.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I call it algorithmic
induction programming.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's done through the books,
all the science fiction books.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:04.860 align:middle line:90%
It's done through "Star Trek."

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.550 align:middle line:90%
It's done through "Star Wars."

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And all of that,
to younger people,

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.210 align:middle line:84%
is that they don't deny
the potential for there

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.150 align:middle line:84%
to be UFOs, or aliens, or
anything else out there.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's
acceptable, in a way.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it's
presented that way.

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: It's
not fearful to them.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.211 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
That's the big thing.

00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:25.099 align:middle line:84%
But it is fearful
to our scientists.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
It is fearful to
the old paradigms.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:84%
We're operating off
130-year-old physics.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, yeah.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And also, that leads back to
the legendary folklore of stuff

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:90%
that is in ancient scriptures.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything about this,
or even today's urban legends,

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.459 align:middle line:84%
I think, have actually come
from ancient Egypt and before.

00:17:46.459 --> 00:17:48.625 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: If you want
to go to urban legends--

00:17:48.625 --> 00:17:50.209 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: To stay
away from the rivers.

00:17:50.209 --> 00:17:52.666 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Well, and stay
away from Dulce, New Mexico.

00:17:52.666 --> 00:17:53.632 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:17:53.632 --> 00:17:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: You don't
want to go there after dark.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.123 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
of other areas, too,

00:17:57.123 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:90%
and they enter into myth.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And the myth is always
based on fear, to not

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:90%
go there, to not be there.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that happens

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
is, if we have pictures, which
we have sculpture and pictures

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:84%
of hybrids, of Camaros, of
all these different entities,

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and we have statues
all over the world.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's wrong to think
that they're all symbolic.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like, why can't you and
your consciousness accept

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.429 align:middle line:84%
that there may have been
these type of creatures?

00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:37.229 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:18:37.229 --> 00:18:38.979 align:middle line:84%
There was a possibility
of this happening.

00:18:38.979 --> 00:18:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
There may have been
giants in the Earth.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.880 align:middle line:90%
And if there were, great.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to spend
time to explore it,

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.800 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
information out there.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to be locked
into the old paradigms.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things is
you have to create space.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to create space
in your mind, space

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
in your imagination,
to be inclusive of what

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:90%
the future is going to bring.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Randy, while I was
working in some of the projects

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.920 align:middle line:84%
out in the oceans, they were
doing a lot of hybridization

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:90%
of all sorts of things.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And there was,
many times, things

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:84%
escaped from these
lab facilities

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.764 align:middle line:84%
that were in the
water, in the oceans--

00:19:20.764 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
Under water, yeah.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --and never
recovered, by the way.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of anything
like that or facilities

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:84%
that have had these
hybrids get away or escape?

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I'd like to introduce

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:84%
is the variety of
life as it exists.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.850 align:middle line:84%
We think only on
surface level and above.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:50.065 align:middle line:84%
We're very knowledgeable about
surface level biological life

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:52.350 align:middle line:90%
forms and aerials, right?

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.525 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
But when it comes

00:19:54.525 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
to underwater, if you
look at the films,

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.770 align:middle line:84%
the data that's available,
like creatures in the Mariana

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Trench, you don't have to
go off-world to find ET.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.586 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:20:08.586 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: You
can find plenty.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And we consider it
basically unexplored,

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.150 align:middle line:84%
as far as the
depths of the ocean,

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and the inventory of life
that exists through that.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I love the popular
films they come up

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:84%
with that there's
underwater mermaids.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:84%
There's no telling, through
history, if any of these things

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.340 align:middle line:90%
have existed.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason is
of cataclysmic change that

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:84%
has occurred on the
Earth at various times

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:84%
throughout history,
and its propensity

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.550 align:middle line:90%
to destroy entire ecosystems.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with that
is, what if there's, like,

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:90%
remnants?

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:84%
What if there's
some residual place

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:84%
where maybe some of that
biology still exists?

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And we know that, too,
because in Australia, maybe 20

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:84%
years ago, they discovered a
fern or something that they

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.160 align:middle line:90%
thought was totally extinct.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And yet, here it is from
20 or 200 million years ago

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's thriving in
this little ecosystem.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.235 align:middle line:84%
So we do have anomalies
and we have them

00:21:15.235 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you can allow for them
to be in the physical world,

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:84%
then you have to allow that
they had some form of existence

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.900 align:middle line:84%
in the non-physical,
in the realm

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
of infinite consciousness,
or the collective universe,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge
that's available in it.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And we are no ways cognizant
of the total amount

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge in the universe.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:84%
What we see on the Earth
is just the outcome,

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:84%
they're all outcomes, of various
vectors, and information,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and energy flows,
various material

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:84%
that gets incorporated
into some form.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle in a human.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't it be a miracle
in any other life form?

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And who says they can't have
wings or they can't have fins?

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:10%
We have gill slits when
we're three months old.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:10%
That shows an
evolutionary change

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:10%
that didn't carry through.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, you'll see
a birth of a baby that

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:84%
has gill slits on the
side of their throat.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this
is all indicative

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:25.870 align:middle line:84%
that there is a wide range
of physicality and reality

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:90%
that we have no clue about.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And also required is that we
be open to the exploration.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: How can people
tell what is real

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.180 align:middle line:90%
and what's paranormal?

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And how would you
describe paranormal

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:46.250 align:middle line:84%
compared to being tricked by
a 3D representation of a ghost

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: There is
no reality but reality.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.570 align:middle line:84%
We'll start with
that one All reality,

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:57.530 align:middle line:84%
as far as most people are
concerned, is physical reality.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:02.140 align:middle line:84%
That physical reality is being
interpreted by a set of senses.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And just like we
would use instruments

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.310 align:middle line:84%
to detect that which is
non-sensible or non-sensitively

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
acquired through human
senses, in other words,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:84%
we could have enhanced ability
to record electronic emissions

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.570 align:middle line:84%
or radiation, there's
all kinds of more things

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:84%
out there besides just
hard physical reality.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:84%
So in dream states, you
take your senses with you.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:90%
They kind of abandon the body.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And those senses are
able to bi-locate.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:84%
They're able to travel around
and find out information.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:84%
But where they're traveling
has no physicality.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But as far as your senses
are concerned, they do.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:84%
When you see the
monster, you're scared.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.800 align:middle line:84%
If you want a
technological explanation,

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.200 align:middle line:90%
you would watch "Monsters Inc."

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.880 align:middle line:84%
because it gives
the best explanation

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:90%
of what we're talking about.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we go from the
paranormal, which

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
exists in that area of senses
being able to interpret,

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:10.840 align:middle line:84%
but having no physicality,
even at the limits

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:84%
of its physicality
is a plasma state.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you
want to know what

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that is watch
"Ghostbusters," OK?

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So these kind of movies,
in a humorous form,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:84%
actually hint that maybe
an explanation of things

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that we would otherwise not be
able to acquire unless we went

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:84%
into in-depth physics, and
chemistry, and everything

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.780 align:middle line:90%
in our sciences.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.366 align:middle line:84%
So I like them as sort
of a intro, the idea

00:24:38.366 --> 00:24:39.865 align:middle line:84%
that you could take
that information

00:24:39.865 --> 00:24:42.100 align:middle line:90%
and start exploring it.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And then the man-made
projections and things,

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:90%
they require technology.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So we would say that there
is a technological smell.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.256 align:middle line:90%
There's a technological feeling.

00:24:58.256 --> 00:24:59.056 align:middle line:90%
There's a--

00:24:59.056 --> 00:25:00.514 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's
something just not

00:25:00.514 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:84%
right about this aircraft
flying into this mountain.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:05.883 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:25:05.883 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Because if it has
a hard physicality,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.940 align:middle line:90%
you can go touch it.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:84%
If it exists in the paranormal,
or in the imagination,

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.690 align:middle line:84%
or dream states, it really
can't have any physicality.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:84%
It can approach
physicality like, say,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.100 align:middle line:90%
at the limit of a plasma state.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.620 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
into the in-between,

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:84%
the technological
projections and stuff,

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:84%
they have a
technological signature.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.380 align:middle line:84%
They can never duplicate
reality exactly,

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what they say,
because they can't duplicate

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:45.760 align:middle line:84%
photon density, and information
density, and energy density all

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:90%
You can get close.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:84%
But at some level,
it becomes Memorex.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a recording.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that's what
you see in our movies and stuff

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.190 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:04.720 align:middle line:84%
They are projected
scientifically, technically,

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to be able to cause
you to believe.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.451 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And
the thing about reality

00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:84%
is, you don't have
to believe in it.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:84%
The other things require
that portion of myth

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and the human mind, reserved
for myth and the human mind,

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.320 align:middle line:84%
and reserved for
fears, and reserved

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.870 align:middle line:84%
for all kinds of
imaginative interactions.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's a difference
between the three.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.931 align:middle line:84%
And they could probably
use this technology, too,

00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to discombobulate and
manipulate people as well.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Oh, yes.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.030 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a movie,
what you've seen

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:90%
is real from a photonic aspect.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: You
have the memory of it.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:90%
You have sight, sound.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.540 align:middle line:84%
But really, you only
have sight and sound,

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:90%
you don't have touch.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So anything you see on a video
screen doesn't include touch.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I know we have touch
screens, but that's just

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:90%
an electromagnetic grounding.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So when they come
up with it, you

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
can touch it, and this,
that, and the other.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've hit a high
degree of projectability

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:90%
of ideas and consciousness.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:18.220 align:middle line:84%
But you also enter into the
realm of translation physics

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
where you can actually translate
information into a solid form

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and turn around and have
that as something that's

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.901 align:middle line:90%
able to engage all the senses.

00:27:26.901 --> 00:27:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And it's
not out of the realm

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:84%
to think that if there
are advanced civilizations

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.096 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that they would
be capable of these things

00:27:36.096 --> 00:27:37.720 align:middle line:84%
because it's our next
level of physics.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Randy, that was great.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.054 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming on the show.

00:27:41.054 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:90%
And we'll see you next time.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.585 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Glad to be here.

00:27:43.585 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That was an
interesting conversation

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.590 align:middle line:84%
with Randy on some of
the ways the public may

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:51.370 align:middle line:84%
be misidentifying bizarre
sightings and the true agenda

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.020 align:middle line:90%
and identity behind them.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Hope to see you on
the next episode.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Emery Smith.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.120 align:middle line:90%
