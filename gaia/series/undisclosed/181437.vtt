>>EMERY SMITH: I'm
your host Emery Smith.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.340 align:middle line:10%
I have been involved with
many undisclosed government

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:10%
projects.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle line:10%
Today, Randy
Veitenheimer joins me

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:10%
to talk about remote viewing.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.107 align:middle line:84%
Randy, thanks for joining
us on the show today.

00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
Good to see you again.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Randy, tell us
about the Tibetan way

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.725 align:middle line:84%
versus remote viewing
of Russell Targ.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER:
The easiest way, I

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
guess, to explain it would be
one is a process of technique

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and one is a process of
expansion or evolution.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll rephrase
that a different way.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:84%
One would be an
exoteric protocol,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and the other would be
an esoteric outcome.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:90%
And they're different.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:10%
So Russell Targ was
Stanford Research Institute,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:10%
at the instigation
of the government,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:10%
came up with a program to teach
people to do remote viewing.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And the whole process required
scientific validation.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:90%
So they put constraints on it.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:90%
They put technique involved.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And the whole time
they looked for people

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:90%
that had some ability.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:90%
That's esoteric ability.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:84%
That's psychic--
they hate that word.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:90%
I do too.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But some form of
intuitive capacity.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Like testing people.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about that is like
people that are intellectual

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:84%
generally have constraints
of their ability

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:84%
to develop an
internal landscape.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And that internal
landscape is something

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.900 align:middle line:84%
that is sort of unique as an
outcome of doing meditation

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and techniques that were
developed in Tibet and India

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you look
at it that way, it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:84%
becomes absolutely the
province of the practitioner.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not about the technique.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
The difference is SRI
techniques and later

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Shealy in Missouri and
some guys up in Oregon.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's people
all over that teach this.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
But they're
basically telling you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:84%
that you're capable of
doing it, but you don't

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:90%
have the requisite stance.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
You haven't developed
this internal ability

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:90%
to be able to see things.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's also a language that
the Native American sue also,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.640 align:middle line:90%
the ability to see.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things about
the program that Russell Targ

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.590 align:middle line:90%
developed was that it evolved.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And that evolution
later led Russell

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:90%
to write a very small book.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:10%
And in it he came to realize the
validity of the esoteric method

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:10%
versus the technical method
that he had developed

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.990 align:middle line:10%
and had quite a long
conversation about that.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is like
in meditative type practices

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:84%
or some of the practices
in the esoteric and Tibet

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and places like that, remote
viewing is not remote viewing.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the ability to
focus your consciousness

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
or to realize your
consciousness exists everywhere

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it's literally
just turning your head

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:84%
would be a physical action,
but this is turning your mind.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Not tuning, but just
turning your mind

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
to a specific time or
a specific location.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that's an
emergent ability.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
It comes out from
doing those exercises.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, some people
take longer than others.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But the technical aspects of it,
if you go the technical method,

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.470 align:middle line:84%
can be learned
over several months

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
or a course of a couple of
years with some of these people.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric method
is more deep.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:84%
It may require decades to
where you come to that position

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:84%
to where you can place
your mind on something,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:90%
or some place or some time.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And we call that an
internal landscape.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:84%
The landscape is
like the TV screen

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:84%
is viewing exactly what's there,
not what you're supplying.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
The biggest problem is
the human propensity

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:84%
to give meaning to things even
if there's no meaning there

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.070 align:middle line:90%
or no meaning to be given.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:90%
So that's the basic differences.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's a valuable tool.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody should have
some sense of where they're at,

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
where they're going,
and the future.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:84%
If that's remote viewing,
then I'm all for it.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You have to
have just one thing,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's a
completely blank mind,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and know that you're on a
mission to describe something

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that or go somewhere and
find out something, or go

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.110 align:middle line:90%
be someone.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>VEITENHEIMER: That's true.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
about it is the scientific,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:84%
the intellect is incapable of
translating certain things.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:90%
Take love, for instance.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no scientific
analysis of love.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what it is.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And yet we have a
knowingness of it.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And there becomes the
divide between the intellect

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:90%
and knowingness.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Knowingness is a higher
form of intellect.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
happens in meditation, or it

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:84%
comes through like
the ability to see--

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.190 align:middle line:90%
that's what we'll call it--

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.150 align:middle line:90%
is that it's strictly neutral.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So neutrality does
become the primary tool

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do these things.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What are we separating
when we think this way?

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER:
Classical remote viewing

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:90%
is a matter of technique.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, it's
an abstraction of reality.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And as an abstraction
of reality,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:90%
it is subject to interpretation.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what you find
in remote viewing sessions

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:84%
is that they do them and then
they try to interpret them.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's kind of
like astrology or something.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.302 align:middle line:84%
But the basic techniques
is pretty interesting.

00:06:48.302 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Hotel
Santa Fe in New Mexico

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:90%
one day with Russell Targ.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting in
the lobby with him.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And the ego is a very
entertaining thing.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.720 align:middle line:84%
I said that basically
I'm better than you.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
conversation we've had

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.170 align:middle line:84%
about lasers and other
things throughout the years.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of my said, well,
I'm better than you.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, oh, yeah?

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's in my pocket.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And here we go with the
box theory and all that.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there and
I go, well, it's round.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
It's about 3 inches in
diameter, about 1/2 inch thick.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:90%
It's black.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm doing it
the way he does it.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And so he just looks at me and
he goes, OK, what does it do?

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, you
lift it to your mouth.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said I don't know why,
but that's what its function is.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.853 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled out a collapsible
cup that like the Boy

00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:43.653 align:middle line:90%
Scouts have.

00:07:43.653 --> 00:07:45.028 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right,
I remember those.

00:07:45.028 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER: And he
goes, you're pretty good.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So there you go,
less validation.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was giving a lecture
on basics of remote viewing.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, there's
a person at the back

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that's actually pretty good
that didn't study my techniques.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And so again, I come
out there feeling

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:84%
pretty good about
myself, you know,

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.790 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
learn his techniques.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
They were all evolutionary
through the process

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:90%
of meditation and martial arts.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about some of
the esoteric martial arts

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that are not taught openly
is this ability to know,

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
this ability to see, and to
employ it in everyday actions.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.492 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
residual in most humans.

00:08:34.492 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:84%
But it's definitely
something that

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
would be worth cultivating,
because you would have

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:84%
as an outcome less of a tendency
to hurt yourself or hurt

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:90%
others.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So it has purpose other than
trying to see what's around

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.420 align:middle line:90%
the corner or things like that.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because you're
everywhere all the time.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And when people grasp that
part of your existence

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:84%
with the universe, I think that
would be an interesting thing

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.145 align:middle line:90%
to maybe you could help explain.

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER: So I
think that language

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:84%
of the self, when you
do deep meditations,

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:84%
different practices,
you're consolidating

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
the entire concept of the self
into a more concise, a more

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.170 align:middle line:90%
condensed space.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that,
then the expansion of that

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.920 align:middle line:90%
includes everything.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:90%
I know it's kind of rough.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about people
live in a very diffuse sense

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:90%
of the self.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:90%
That's easiest way to put it.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:90%
They're not 100% themselves.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.000 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of like
all over the place.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
But they're not all over the
place with their whole self.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
When you do meditative
techniques and kind of like get

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:84%
back to yourself-- that's
maybe a good language--

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
then you can take that self and
place it anywhere in the field

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.540 align:middle line:84%
or in your own consciousness
or somebody else's.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why once
you get to that point,

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:84%
all information is
available to you.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
becomes really fast.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:84%
It's really fun because
you're not abstracting.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:90%
You're not interpreting.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.990 align:middle line:90%
You're just relating the truth.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:90%
So what reality would that be?

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:90%
How would you explain 0 and 1?

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER: Well, I came
up with a way to do that.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a book I'm
writing and have been

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.740 align:middle line:84%
writing for a year
or two called "Theory

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.570 align:middle line:90%
of Approximate Reality."

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, fantastic.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah, and
proximity means how close.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you think
about it, you exist

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:90%
in a world that has immediacy.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:90%
It has experience--

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it has existence.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And that world is
the scientific world.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And I call that
number one reality.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the chair
you're sitting on.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the house you inhabit
or the car you're driving,

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:90%
anything else.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.410 align:middle line:90%
But there's another side to it.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:90%
And that side is zero reality.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And zero reality is
everything you can't touch,

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:90%
but it's experiential.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I think science
doesn't cross the divide,

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
because 0 and 1 become a
way that we can interpret

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
our entire existence,
everything, not

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.786 align:middle line:84%
only in existence, but in
experience, so 0 and 1.

00:11:33.786 --> 00:11:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Zero reality is your
imagination, your dreams,

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.700 align:middle line:90%
day dreaming.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:84%
When you say things like,
oh, I was daydreaming

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
or I had a dream,
you weren't here.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:84%
You were not in
number one reality.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.470 align:middle line:90%
You were somewhere else.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has that experience.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And then right in between
those two is another area.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
area of neutrality

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to be here
or the ability to be there.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And be aware of that.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:90%
And take your awareness with it.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So the more aware you are,
the more you are yourself,

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
then automatically
the more ability

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:84%
you would have to be empathetic
or sympathetic with a person

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:90%
and a relationship.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.930 align:middle line:84%
But also, now we apply
it to objects or places

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.910 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So everywhere in the
universe is available to you,

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:84%
but only if you can
consolidate yourself

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:84%
to a point of consciousness
that you can move around.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you move
your consciousness

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and place it on a different
space, a different time,

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:84%
that information's
immediately available.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:90%
There is no processing involved.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's another mark
of SRI's techniques

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.740 align:middle line:90%
because there's a processing.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And as humans, we don't
process certain things.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.600 align:middle line:90%
We just know them.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So knowingness becomes
true remote viewing.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This is why they're
so fascinated about this.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Going back in history
with remote viewing,

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why did the government
put so much money into this?

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER: There's several
different streams or avenues

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.520 align:middle line:84%
that that information
became relevant.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
like out of India.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
I think there was
a lady that went

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and studied Tibetan priests
and stuff in the '30s.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, she
wrote a small book.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember
her name right now.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.760 align:middle line:84%
But when the book
came out, of course,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.485 align:middle line:90%
everybody disbelieved it.

00:13:32.485 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
The people who
disbelieved it are

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:90%
the people that couldn't do it.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:43.045 align:middle line:84%
So then you have later, one
of my teachers was in India.

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And his story was
that the Russians

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:84%
had decided to
kidnap him because

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:84%
of his abilities in
this area and not only

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:90%
that, his ability to teach it.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was pretty
primary source

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.700 align:middle line:90%
of how I learned some of this.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And then a secondary thing was
all Native American medicine

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:84%
man, medicine women, shamans,
they all have this ability.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just organic to, or
nature, we would call it.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And during the late
1890s, about 1910,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
it has been alluded to that
the US government maintained

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:84%
or instigated a practice or
policy of trying to eliminate

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
as many as these people
as possible because

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:84%
of their ability to
know these things.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:90%
I loved my grandmother.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
She was able-- she is what I
call the last cloud reader.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
She could look at the clouds and
tell you all kinds of things.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
answer was the clouds

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.175 align:middle line:84%
were immaterial to
what she was doing.

00:14:51.175 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
thing as people who

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:90%
use tarot cards and all this.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Science wants to throw
all that together

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and say it's esoteric and
non-material and non-relevant

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.490 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people,
it's not the cards.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not the pendulum.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not the crystal.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not any of those things.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It's that person's unique
ability to be themselves

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and to recognize the
difference between zero

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and number one
reality and then to be

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.573 align:middle line:84%
able to interact on both
sides with full consciousness.

00:15:20.573 --> 00:15:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right, right.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And how do the scientists
look at that now

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:84%
utilizing all these techniques
with quantum physics?

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Is there--

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER: Well,
first of all, science

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:90%
doesn't like anecdotal.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't like experiential.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.520 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you I love
somebody or I did this.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:90%
It's totally experiential.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And at that point
in the intellect,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:90%
it's subject to interpretation.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
How about, oh, OK,
you love somebody?

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Or, oh, you had a good time
or you had this experience.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And then let's go into a
full scientific protocol.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.523 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you can
validate experience.

00:16:04.523 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same thing, you
can't validate imagination.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:12.010 align:middle line:90%
You can't validate dream states.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:84%
There's just a whole bunch
that science doesn't apply to.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:90%
But knowingness does.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Knowingness applies
to those things

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:90%
that are beyond the intellect.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, that's
the dividing line.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And so much of
human experience is

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.090 align:middle line:90%
beyond scientific validation.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And yet we tried to insist on it
through psychology, psychiatry,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:84%
pharmacy, all kinds of different
ways that they go at it.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:90%
And they're insufficient.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:90%
That's my opinion.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But I think
it's very soon that

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
with the new technologies that
are coming out that they're

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to show how
this works in a scientific way

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and put it all together
where it makes sense.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER: The ability
to discern the truth,

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:90%
everybody has it.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Not many people use it.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:84%
It is something that
you can learn to do.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a physiological
basis for it.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:84%
They call it muscle
testing, although I

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:90%
find that way too slow.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It gets into the fact that we're
interactive with the universe

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.890 align:middle line:84%
at about 1/10,000
in 20th of a second.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
flicker rate I guess

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.280 align:middle line:90%
you'd call to this reality.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at all
that, if you go beyond it,

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:84%
now you're into some
realm of quantum realms

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:38.950 align:middle line:84%
or sub-quantum realms or even
up to translational and other

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.860 align:middle line:90%
physics that I work on.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Some of these being
at the lowest realms of the,

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.220 align:middle line:84%
let's just say, the door
to the next dimension,

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:90%
is what I would call it.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER: Well,
and just to continue

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
that, like an experiential
reality, number one reality,

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:90%
there is Max Planck.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And he comes up with
a Planck's constant.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, of course.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER: And once
go down to minus 36,

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
then you basically eliminated
all physical reality,

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it, is
my interpretation.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:90%
And then those are paradigms.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:18.430 align:middle line:84%
We get locked into these
paradigms of Eisteinian physics

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.020 align:middle line:90%
or even quantum physics.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the whole show.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
One thing that goes on is
the expansion of knowledge,

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.310 align:middle line:90%
expansion of awareness.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:32.890 align:middle line:84%
If we extended Planck's scale
from 36 down to, let's say, 80,

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.290 align:middle line:90%
all that would be experiential.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:39.070 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that it's
like scientifically provable,

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:84%
because we went beyond
that at the minus 36 mark.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, we
might end up at being

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.970 align:middle line:84%
able to explain string
theory at number 40

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
or explain the
transformation physics at 70

00:18:54.670 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:84%
or translational physics at 76,
our life force itself at 67.7.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And those are just
reference points.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:84%
But once we have
a reference point,

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:84%
now it becomes like
in remote viewing.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Hey, let's go take
a look at that

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and see if there's
any information there

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
we can utilize,
something that we

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
can use to improve our
lives, because nobody's ever

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:84%
defined what human
life force is,

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.020 align:middle line:84%
let alone what
alien life force is.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And why is it do you
think they're still

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:90%
studying remote viewing?

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER: I
explained to one physicist

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:90%
I worked with, I'm a dinosaur.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is I have
some residual talent or skills

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.730 align:middle line:90%
that are still present.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's various people
out there that do it.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:84%
We call them naturals
in martial arts.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
the idea of trying

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.800 align:middle line:84%
to translate that, like say,
back to the intellectual.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And once you go beyond
into the natural talents,

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.100 align:middle line:84%
science steps up and
wants to use the intellect

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:90%
to try to figure it out.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:90%
The intellect is insufficient.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.860 align:middle line:84%
It creates doubt once
you go into knowingness.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Again, I was with some
physicist and he said, well,

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:84%
you can't prove anything
you're talking about?

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you
love your wife?

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And his wife smacks
him on the shoulder.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, I told you.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:84%
In other words like he wants to
view the world through a lens

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.580 align:middle line:90%
of just the scientific.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's bigger than that.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:84%
It's incredibly
bigger than that.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things about
the use of machines or things

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
that the intellect develop
is they don't work.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.190 align:middle line:84%
There's no technique
or no machine works.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the person that
uses their consciousness

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
to be able to extend
themselves through that.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And, again, it becomes a tool.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.960 align:middle line:90%
And some people need tools.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And on the dinosaur side,
they didn't use tools.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.420 align:middle line:90%
It was all innate.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, their
survival rate was greater,

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:84%
I think, for those with innate
consciousness and abilities

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
than those who just strictly
have an intellectual approach

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Does that
have an effect

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:84%
on the morphogenic field
to other people around them

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and around the world
that they don't know?

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Just because of once we say it,
once we experience something,

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:84%
it becomes part of the
reality, of a reality.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>VEITENHEIMER: Yes, yes.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:84%
What they do is
projective reality.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:90%
So you are guilty of it--

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:90%
or do it.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Everybody does.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is they project a
reality of their own creation.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.290 align:middle line:84%
The reality of their creation
is one of interpretation.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Now we're back to that again.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
about reality itself is--

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and I hate the words,
it is what it is--

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.860 align:middle line:90%
but reality is just what it is.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not subject
to interpretation.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.290 align:middle line:84%
It is subject to description
but only in the language

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and experiences you
have with your own self.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:10%
And so people of
vaster experience

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:24.020 align:middle line:10%
an extension throughout
the world or the universe

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.390 align:middle line:10%
through their
efforts, own efforts,

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:30.110 align:middle line:10%
will tend to be more
accurate is what happens.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle line:90%
No, I agree.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard of any positive
stories in your line of work

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:84%
that something was
use to find something

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:90%
that could have maybe--

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:90%
that you can talk about, I mean.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>VEITENHEIMER: I had a
doctor one time challenged

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:84%
the validity of what we
call remote viewing--

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:84%
or being intuitive or
psychic is the old terms.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
Romans had a phrase

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.940 align:middle line:84%
of never let a
soothsayer say sooth.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:84%
I can't do it in
the Latin anymore.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.640 align:middle line:84%
But basically anybody
that could tell the truth,

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.720 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to get rid of.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is all about being able
to tell the truth of things.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:84%
But the doctor asked
me about where's

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:22.310 align:middle line:84%
the body of the aide in DC
that got killed years ago.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that's
real simple she's up

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.447 align:middle line:90%
on the side of a riverbank.

00:23:27.447 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And he just looked at me and
goes, how do you know that?

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.405 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, you
asked the question.

00:23:31.405 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:90%
How do you not know it?

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well, why
don't you go to the police?

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And I go, OK, I know where
the body is-- prime suspect.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole lot of people
out there that know things,

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.270 align:middle line:84%
not just about things
like that, but they're not

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
about to admit to
them or let it out

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:53.522 align:middle line:84%
because of the suspicious nature
of certain agencies and stuff.

00:23:53.522 --> 00:23:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, about six
months later they found it,

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.897 align:middle line:84%
and he came back to him and
he goes, you were right.

00:23:57.897 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And I go, I wasn't
trying to be right.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's the big difference.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.180 align:middle line:84%
In remote viewing
as it's taught,

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:90%
SRI, they're trying to be right.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
make somebody happy.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And on this side, we're not
trying to make anybody happy.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:10%
We're just trying to
tell the truth of it.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.393 align:middle line:84%
And I told him, I wasn't
trying to be right.

00:24:14.393 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:90%
I was trying to be truthful.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And then another lady
called me several years ago.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.540 align:middle line:10%
And her husband had
taken her child away.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, where's my child?

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:90%
This is on the phone.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
I go two miles this way, 1/4
mile that way, 1/2 a mile

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.570 align:middle line:90%
back to the left.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said when you
pull up to that house.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.920 align:middle line:84%
She called me back and
said, we just missed them.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I'm sorry about that.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:43.130 align:middle line:84%
But that process
of knowing this,

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:46.010 align:middle line:84%
it's the same thing in Native
American, we don't hunt.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.480 align:middle line:90%
We go where the deer is.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:90%
We go where the fish is.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the funniest thing in
the world, when I grew up,

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.170 align:middle line:84%
like a Native American
community, people go,

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:90%
oh, let's go hunting.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:90%
And we just laugh.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Why would you waste the time?

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you just go--

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.626 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: There right over there.

00:25:00.626 --> 00:25:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's a instantaneously
knowing something.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's a skill that
can be developed.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:10%
I think people should use
it more and less television

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:10%
maybe, except for this show.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:90%
So there.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:84%
No, I agree for the
education part about that.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was just an
interesting and amazing

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:90%
conversation, Randy.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Thanks again for
coming on the show.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:90%
We really appreciate it.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:90%
