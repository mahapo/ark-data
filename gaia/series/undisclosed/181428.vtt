>>EMERY SMITH: I am
your host, Emery Smith.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:10%
There been a lot of talk
about super soldiers.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.220 align:middle line:84%
What exactly is a super
soldier, and what abilities

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:84%
do they have that are
above most humans?

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:84%
One of the projects
I was involved with

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:84%
was a super soldier
program, where

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:84%
we were assigned with
enhancing the human body,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.350 align:middle line:84%
not only on a physical
and mental level,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:84%
but also on a psychic
and energetic level.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:84%
We experimented with various
ways of training and mechanisms

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:84%
to enhance these
extrasensory abilities

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:90%
to create a supertype soldier.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm here with
Randy Veitenheimer

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.240 align:middle line:84%
to discuss some of the
abilities that most of us

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.600 align:middle line:84%
already have, but are
yet to be activated.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Hey, Randy, thanks for
coming on the show.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER: Good
to see you again, Emery.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's all
this talk about super soldiers

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.083 align:middle line:84%
on the net and all over
the place, people claiming

00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:09.190 align:middle line:84%
to be super soldiers, and also
different types of programs

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:90%
and things you can find.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Could you maybe list some
of those types of programs

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.360 align:middle line:84%
through your experience
that you heard of

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle line:90%
or that you were involved with?

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:10%
>>VEITENHEIMER: It's actually
been ongoing programs

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:10%
throughout history.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Is training, discipline,
things like that

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
were to make you a better
soldier, whether it

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.842 align:middle line:84%
was Sparta or the troops that
fought in the Vedic literature.

00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:35.800 align:middle line:90%
They were all the same.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Egyptians, everybody
had some program

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.540 align:middle line:84%
where they would try to enhance
or increase a person's ability

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:84%
to fight, and later
maybe to survive.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.580 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't so
important in history,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:84%
but now, so much time and
effort spent on soldiers,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.030 align:middle line:90%
it's an expensive proposition.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So now we have programs
that are trying

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:90%
to enhance their effectiveness.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
when I looked at it

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
is you have to be able to
have some way to measure it.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things that comes up

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:84%
is the idea of integration
of a new technology

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:84%
or any new discipline,
and then how synchronized

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
you are with it, how
ability to work with it,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and then how can you
operate out of that.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can't
operate with the technology,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:90%
it's a waste.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.888 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: So
what we have out

00:02:31.888 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot of corporate
and military operations

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and programs, and
they're not integrated.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the place.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:84%
You have everybody
trying to develop up

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.460 align:middle line:84%
all these different
systems, and not all of them

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:84%
work together, just
like any human being.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Not everything works together.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, there's
physical programs.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:90%
And these are pretty extant.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the place.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
You can find any kind
of physical program

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:84%
you want out there to promote
the growth and functionality

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:90%
of the human body.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
We have technological,
everything from AI

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:84%
to electronic implants,
the ability for those

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:90%
to communicate to us.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Just think about having an Apple
Watch on your arm in the field

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and being able to dial
up information or receive

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:84%
messages, particularly
from airborne assets.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
That would allow you

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
a greater proximity sense, a
greater awareness, battlefield

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.210 align:middle line:90%
awareness.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
If we go beyond that, now
we have physical implants.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.824 align:middle line:84%
And we have extra
exoskeleton type situations.

00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, the mechanical
ones that I was, you know--

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.545 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: So we have
certain mechanical super

00:03:42.545 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:84%
soldiers, we have physical
super soldiers, we have--

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
just it goes on
forever, where somebody

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:84%
had a brilliant
idea, but every one

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
of them, if they don't include
integration, synchronization,

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and congruency, it's impossible
to evaluate the overall effect

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.240 align:middle line:90%
of those programs.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot more.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Remote viewing.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.680 align:middle line:84%
If you have a remote
viewer, if you

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.330 align:middle line:84%
have a combat pilot
like on drones,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I would venture to
say they're probably

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
not effective at
physical combat, right?

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of them may
be, but those are not

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:84%
the skill sets that
they're being employed for.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So obviously you have
to have some idea

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
of where you're going to deploy
and what you're going to deploy

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of techniques,
what kind of training

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
would help them best
execute their mission.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
And the problem is

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:84%
it's divided across
the corporations

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and the various
military branches.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So all these make major
advancements, but not

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:84%
all of them come
together in a way

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:84%
that we would say we
have a super soldier.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
What senses do we
have that are yet

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
to be activated amongst
the general public,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and how have they incorporated
that into these programs?

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: One
of the first one

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.520 align:middle line:84%
comes to mind is,
in basic training,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:84%
it's common for inductees
to gain bone strength,

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:84%
to gain mass, to
increase height,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.300 align:middle line:84%
even if they come in
at 18, 22 years old.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the things that,
when you look at, let's say,

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
an enemy, is that they
may not have had that.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.710 align:middle line:84%
If you look at people that
grow up in the United States,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:84%
the amount of food information
density, we'll call it,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.470 align:middle line:90%
and the extent of it is amazing.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.160 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to,
say, the Middle East,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:90%
or you go to China--

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Indonesia.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --yeah.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: These
very small people.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They don't have the
calcium, the milk that we have.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
the bone density.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And all the
hormones that come with that.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.126 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have the bone
density and muscle mass.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And then to introduce
that after 18 years old

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
becomes an add-on, as opposed
to an integrated program.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So we are super soldiers
in the United States,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
in the fact that we have
available all the nutrients

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
out there, the entire
spectrum of nutrients,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
that it will allow you to
grow and develop physicality.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, physicality, we see
it on our football fields.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:84%
We see it in all
our sports programs.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And then if we go to the
mental, mental training,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
well, there's video games
now, but cognitive thinking

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and cognitive processes,
historically Go or chess

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:84%
or crossword, I mean,
there's a wide variety.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:84%
But when we start using
them as remote viewing

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
is when we start coming
into an understanding

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.129 align:middle line:90%
of the reach of the human mind.

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And how do
you teach your students

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:84%
to activate some
of these senses?

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, how would
you teach a sniper?

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, what things could
you do for someone like that?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: I've
actually done this.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Had some students, and their
performance is exceptional.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is
increasing awareness.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:90%
And there's exercises.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a program of
development that I teach,

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:84%
where your awareness can
include information around you.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:90%
It's called a proximity sense.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
proximate reality.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And so your reality of what you
sense just in your living room

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.660 align:middle line:84%
or driving down the street
is actually very limited.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But I learned it in
Native American traditions

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.600 align:middle line:84%
when I learned to hunt
at a very early age.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I always find amusing

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
is, as a Native American,
we don't go hunting, right?

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:90%
We go to where the deer is.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:90%
We go to where the fish is.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:90%
There's no reason to hunt them.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.110 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason to
wander around, because they

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:90%
have a presence in the field.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:90%
And now we're back to that.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So I explained to my students
that, in any square mile,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle line:84%
you could locate the
presence of an enemy,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:84%
you could identify
the number, you could

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.967 align:middle line:90%
identify direction of travel.

00:08:10.967 --> 00:08:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm talking about
Native American, where

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:84%
we talk about deer
or we're talking

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:84%
about turkeys or
anything else, but it's

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:90%
the same kind of sense.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It's just I refined
it into techniques,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.600 align:middle line:84%
teachings, trainings
that allows somebody

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:84%
to develop those skills and
extend their awareness to be

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:90%
inclusive at any distance.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
So that's just one
aspect of where

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.740 align:middle line:84%
we would say that was mental
training or awareness training.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Also while working in
the genetic programs,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that there
are certain markers,

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, that I do
believe are primal,

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.440 align:middle line:90%
that come already with us.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:54.009 align:middle line:84%
Does everyone come equipped with
this type of sensories, or not?

00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: There's a
difference between activation

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.940 align:middle line:90%
and expression.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Just to move to the
side a little bit,

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:07.250 align:middle line:84%
women have a much greater
informational exchange

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.320 align:middle line:84%
at an emotional
level than men do.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:90%
They have about--

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I can definitely
attest to that.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --to the
extent it's about seven times.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So we can kind of
calibrate these things,

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and find that, say, when a
male says hello, it's hello,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and when a female
says hello, it may

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.980 align:middle line:84%
be when did you get
divorced, and what happened,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and I mean there's all
this other content.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that the
available information is not

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:44.160 align:middle line:84%
only processing and
present in the individual,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.040 align:middle line:84%
it's available to
the other person.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:90%
So team dynamics would benefit.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the things
I think is kind of we'll

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.360 align:middle line:84%
call it interesting that the
military excludes females,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
when there may be
a super soldier

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:90%
aspect to their presence.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And nobody
ever thinks about these things.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I know.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:10%
I just recently saw on the cover
page of one of the magazines,

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.130 align:middle line:10%
you know, the first female
warrior frontline soldier.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, this
is long overdue.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Could you give me an
example of how those senses,

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.410 align:middle line:84%
or maybe something
that you worked with?

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: The conversation
comes up of being human,

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
where we have integrated
programming that

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:84%
says do not kill, do not harm
someone, do good, be good,

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.640 align:middle line:90%
feel good.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Some of us look good.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you start going
through that, where does it

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:90%
fit in killing an enemy?

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:90%
It's the opposite programming.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So what happens-- and it's
unique to human beings--

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:84%
is we have a mammalian brain
overlaying a reptilian brain.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
If there was any evidence
needed of us being artificially

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:84%
engineered, our
origins somewhere out

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
in the universe,
that would be it,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:90%
because it's just not logical.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we run into.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So now let's say I take a person
and train them to be a soldier.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that I'm
encountering somebody

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:90%
who already has programming.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to teach them to
go against that programming.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
What do you think's
going to happen?

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:84%
It's called an
internal conflict.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And it shows up,
obviously, with a number

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:90%
of people that now have PTSD.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.363 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: That's an
internal conflict, where

00:11:51.363 --> 00:11:54.009 align:middle line:84%
they have been programmed
for 18 or 20 years,

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and now we have a new program
that says it's OK for you

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.270 align:middle line:90%
to kill the enemy.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:90%
To protect yourself.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Killing is a reptilian aspect
of human consciousness.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not a mammalian
particularly, right?

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're back to
integration, synchronization,

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:90%
congruency.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And the activation of
the reptilian brain

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:84%
as a portion of combat skills
is something that's really never

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:90%
been taught openly.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was the recipient
of a lot of that training,

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:90%
and pass it on to my students.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So why is it
that some of these,

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:84%
you know, children were
born already with these,

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, special abilities of
being psychic and more aware

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:90%
than others?

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Well,
you had stated it earlier

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:84%
when you talked
about activation,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and what I refer
to as expression.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So even if we take the mammalian
and overlay to the reptilian

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
brain, it's the
amount of energy that

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:90%
is expressed through each one.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
When you're really angry
and mad or in a bar fight,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:90%
you are not necessarily logical.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:84%
You're not necessarily
mammalian and nurturing.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we would say
there's other aspects that

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:90%
come into play.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Fight and flight
and all those hormones.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.886 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Those
are all reptilian.

00:13:21.886 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:84%
They are not
necessarily mammalian.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
like certain people,

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:84%
by virtue of their
biology and genetics

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and what I call the
incoming consciousness,

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
may express higher theta
waves or higher beta waves.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:90%
They might be harder workers.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an expression
of what is going on already

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:90%
in the physicality.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
about the reptilian brain

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.760 align:middle line:84%
is that the difference
between a killer

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and the difference between
a killer and a soldier.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:84%
A soldier should
be able to engage

00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:84%
all the senses necessary for
its expression and survival.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:90%
That's all humans.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So we could say that the
reptilian brain is actually

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:90%
necessary for human survival.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.310 align:middle line:84%
But somebody who's locked
in to the reptilian

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:11.894 align:middle line:90%
is what we would call a killer.

00:14:11.894 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:84%
It's somebody
that's cold-blooded,

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.170 align:middle line:90%
we have all the language for.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And in the news, we try to
explain these serial killers.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: They have become
locked into the reptilian.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And
what's interesting is

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.380 align:middle line:90%
it's possible to measure this.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:84%
We can measure the relative
amount of integration

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.830 align:middle line:84%
between the mammalian
and the reptilian,

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and we can measure the amount
of energy flowing through it,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:84%
because if there is no energy
flowing through your reptilian

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:84%
brain, you're not
very aggressive.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: True.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And so it has
some interesting applications

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
that I've looked at, like
in sports and other fields,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.524 align:middle line:90%
other than just military.

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What are those
benefits for raising--

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Well, the
survival in the reptilian

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:90%
is obviously the major function.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.830 align:middle line:84%
But with it comes a
cold-bloodedness, a willingness

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.230 align:middle line:90%
to sacrifice all these things.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And on the mammalian side,
we see it as nurturing,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
the desire to take
care of, the desire

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:84%
to engage in
endorphin production,

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:84%
if we want to move
it to the chemical.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I like is
people tend to want

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to take university
classes, or they

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:84%
want to take something
formalized education.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at film,
if you look at the movies

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and stuff out there,
every once in a while,

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:90%
they hit upon a truth.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: They
hit upon a truth--

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I've seen this.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --that
you can use and integrate

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.340 align:middle line:84%
into your life or explore
as a path of learning.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Could we now jump to
EMF, electromagnetic fields,

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.650 align:middle line:90%
and the senses behind them?

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And we alone admit, you
know, energy and receive

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:84%
energy, you know,
of these fields.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, what is
that all about?

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:90%
What is EMF?

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: The forces
of magnetism and electricity

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:84%
interacting with a
human life force.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the other field,
the other force

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.480 align:middle line:84%
that's not expressed
or talked about,

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
because without human life,
none of this makes any sense.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.740 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So they want to give all
this importance to EM

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and gravitation and
everything else,

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:84%
but human consciousness they
turn around and say right away

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:90%
has an influence on all this.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.410 align:middle line:90%
This is how you be creative.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:84%
This is how you
create your reality.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of the matter
is that we're not aware enough

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:90%
to be interactive as a rule.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It's back to that
observation and the idea

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
of being observational, and
to take the observer status.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:90%
There's you a program.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a program, and
as I referred to earlier,

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:84%
it's the same program where you
learn to go where the fish are.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And we know that people, certain
people, have these abilities.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.440 align:middle line:90%
They always find a fish.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:90%
They always find a deer.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:84%
They always find whatever
they're looking for.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
they're field interactive.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And not just with
electromagnetic fields,

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.349 align:middle line:84%
but also with fields
of consciousness,

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and even collective
consciousness

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:90%
in the universal field.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They're cheating.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
They're already know
where the fish is.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes, absolutely.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.642 align:middle line:90%
It's what I do.

00:17:27.642 --> 00:17:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: How dare they.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I also feel the need to
mention how the body is always

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to keep in
balance, in homeostasis

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.695 align:middle line:84%
over these negative
impacts of EMF fields.

00:17:39.695 --> 00:17:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
One of the things

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:46.895 align:middle line:84%
that occurs from that is you
don't have an immune system.

00:17:46.895 --> 00:17:48.940 align:middle line:90%
We can throw that out the door.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be excised
out of the body.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So in my research, you
have an immune response.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.320 align:middle line:84%
You actually have
about 26 of them.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:90%
And those are energized.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you come in contact
with a pathogen or a substance,

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:10.056 align:middle line:84%
you may activate one, all, or
some partial aspect of that.

00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:11.430 align:middle line:84%
When they're
activated, they have

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
to have energy to support
them, support their activation,

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:90%
support their expression.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.444 align:middle line:84%
And you may not have
enough energy to do that.

00:18:18.444 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And then we would
say you get sick

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.350 align:middle line:90%
or you have a cold or whatever.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But if you
had the awareness.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: If you
had the awareness--

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That it was going on.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
--you could block it.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Ah.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And you would
be-- and the language is,

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:90%
with a big enough energy field--

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:90%
I teach 9 foot's a minimum.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:90%
30 feet is better.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:84%
30 feet becomes sort
of a protective barrier

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:90%
against a lot of this.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:47.372 align:middle line:84%
But now you have the ability to,
say, be relatively unaffected.

00:18:47.372 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Is that
consciousness awareness,

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.640 align:middle line:90%
then, you're speaking of?

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: It's actually
an integrated process

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:84%
of everything we talked about
in the super soldier program.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: In other
words, all these things

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:84%
become possible
through potential.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people use
crystals and wear rings

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and bracelets and omelets
and-- not the kind

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:84%
you eat, but all these different
processes are in some way

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:84%
to engage the mind
with an object

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.830 align:middle line:84%
to a greater benefit than
that which you think you have

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.040 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have that
ring or that bracelet

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:90%
or M-16 or anything else.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was about to
say, in the military,

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:84%
they never gave me a crystal,
but they did, you know,

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.640 align:middle line:90%
explain some things, like what--

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
how would you
explain to the public

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:84%
of you teaching them this
situational awareness,

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll call it?

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
Meditative practices.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:90%
They start very simple.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:84%
There's classic ones
that I really enjoy.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:52.312 align:middle line:84%
One of them would be to sit and
close your eyes and drop a pin.

00:19:52.312 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And we have the term,
you ever hear a pin drop.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Now, watch.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And I gave this to a student.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you flip the
pin about five feet.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, it takes a blank room to
do this, because the acoustics.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you keep
throwing the pin.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Familiar
with this, yes.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: So you
get out to 30 feet.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Now what do you do?

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:84%
With your eyes closed,
go pick up the pin.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: So now,
you have interaction.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.890 align:middle line:90%
You have connection.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And without connection,
there's no interaction.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
emotional also state

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:84%
of some of these amazing
soldiers, many of your students

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.540 align:middle line:84%
have explained some things
after they get back from combat.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: It's
not just combat.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Number one, when I
teach these things,

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.120 align:middle line:84%
it's the same things
in everyday life.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
in relationships.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing in jobs.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing in
corporations I work with.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is
situational awareness.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Mhm.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.596 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Gives
you an opportunity

00:20:53.596 --> 00:20:55.267 align:middle line:90%
to express yourself.

00:20:55.267 --> 00:20:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, are you going
to express yourself

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.916 align:middle line:84%
from the mammalian side or
from the reptilian side?

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
express yourself

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:84%
from a logical standpoint
or an emotional standpoint?

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:84%
There gives you four
vectors that we could, like,

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle line:84%
diagram and start getting an
idea of how each person reacts

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:84%
at any given moment to
any given situation.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.945 align:middle line:84%
And one of my students, I
said, OK, first time in combat,

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:90%
what was your response?

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I started laughing.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:90%
And so I started laughing, too.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said, then I looked at my
spotter, and he was not amused.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:38.160 align:middle line:84%
He had been in combat before,
and had developed an attitude

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that this was not
a laughing matter.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: So
he said I immediately

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
changed my position, my mental
position, to one of, oh my,

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:90%
we need to be serious here.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right?

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.110 align:middle line:84%
But you know, one
of the things is

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:84%
joyfulness is a higher flow,
and higher level of energy flow.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.490 align:middle line:84%
If you are joyfully in
combat, if you are joyfully

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.760 align:middle line:84%
engaged in work at your
job, if you're joyfully

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:84%
engaged in your
relationship, you

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.520 align:middle line:84%
are going to get
a better outcome.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
survive that encounter,

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
survive that day.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to a high
emotional state of fear, fight,

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.830 align:middle line:84%
flight, freeze, and
other negative emotions,

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:84%
then you're not
going to do well.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.202 align:middle line:84%
You're going to suffer,
is what it amounts to.

00:22:24.202 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Is there anything
in the natural world

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.462 align:middle line:84%
that actually could suppress
this from us, these senses?

00:22:29.462 --> 00:22:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes,
all kinds of things.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Such as?

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: The loading
in the electromagnetic field,

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:84%
the loading in
different chemicals,

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.100 align:middle line:84%
say in our water
and food supply.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: The difference
in we call them intake.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:90%
When you vary the intake.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Now we have all the
diets in the world.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:90%
When you vary output.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now we have all
the exercise programs.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have I&O,
right, input, output,

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:84%
then we have GIGO,
garbage in, garbage out.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.570 align:middle line:84%
This applies across the
boards, whether it's

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:84%
your physical system, mental
system, emotional systems.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And people, the problem is
people don't have a forum.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.720 align:middle line:84%
These are subjects
where you would

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:84%
be able to sit down with either
your partner or with a friend,

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:90%
and just start exploring.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:90%
How do I respond?

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me, you've been
around me for several years,

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:30.360 align:middle line:84%
how I respond to conflict,
how I respond to opportunity?

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And those two things alone
would open up a whole range

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.840 align:middle line:90%
of ability to improve yourself.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.820 align:middle line:90%
And they would be beneficial.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't require
therapy, they didn't require.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It just required a
conversation, and allowing

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:84%
yourself to become aware of
who you are, how you are,

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:52.450 align:middle line:90%
what you do.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:53.462 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:53.462 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And how you respond.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And
how you respond.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Excellent.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And is there anything out there
now that they can actually

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:84%
suppress the general
public's senses

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:84%
that you're aware of, such as
like HARP and things you hear?

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.281 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Well,
they have I call them

00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:90%
active denial systems.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And an active denial
can be sound or light.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:90%
It can be across an EM spectrum.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately or unfortunately,
they haven't really

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:84%
explored the entire
spectrum, so we're actually

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.500 align:middle line:84%
pretty safe right now
with what they've got.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
But there's probably more to
come, is what I would call it.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not just, you know, walking
through the airport, you know,

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.840 align:middle line:84%
devices there and
things like this.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.465 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: One
of the easiest ways

00:24:38.465 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:84%
to explain what
we're talking about

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:84%
is going to a rock and
roll concert in the '70s.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:90%
Were you affected?

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Were you affected by sound?

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Were you affected by proximity
to other people's thoughts

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:90%
in a condensed area?

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:90%
This is mob psychology.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:84%
This is the mobs you
see in Paris right now.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.214 align:middle line:90%
This is combat situations.

00:25:03.214 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:84%
All these things are
going on, but nobody ever

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:84%
really examined them
and delineated them

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:84%
in a way and put metrics on
them to where we could actually

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:16.020 align:middle line:84%
go for process improvement in
our ability to be ourselves

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.840 align:middle line:90%
and to be human.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And Bearden explains this in a
lot of his books about scalar

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
inferetrometry and how
they're able to turn up crime.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, they can beam
a weapon down into DC,

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
turn the crime up,
or turn it down.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of any
of these satellites

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and other land-based and
underground-based devices?

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah, they
have land-based systems.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Things like HARP and what
you're describing is--

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:49.090 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting that,
back in the '70s--

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.280 align:middle line:84%
that's the benefit
of being old, is

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
that there were programs
to use the ionosphere

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.670 align:middle line:90%
for communication purposes.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of like how
that research got started.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And then there was the Taos
Hum and the ELF, extremely low

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:90%
frequency, waves.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:90%
Again, for communication.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And I've experienced
both of those.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about it is all
those frequencies start having

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.600 align:middle line:90%
an effect on how you feel.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think my brother
expressed it best.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:84%
He said that he never
considered drinking till he

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.760 align:middle line:90%
listened to George Jones.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's music out
there that obviously makes

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:90%
you feel sad or depressed.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.516 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
There's music that

00:26:32.516 --> 00:26:34.280 align:middle line:84%
makes you feel better
or feel uplifted.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: There's music
that makes you feel excited,

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.465 align:middle line:84%
Steppenwolf or
something from the--

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:41.840 align:middle line:90%
there's all kinds of things.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And what we
do is take each one of those

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and start seeing, like,
how do I react to it?

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's self-observation.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.480 align:middle line:84%
To become the observer
becomes the exact thing

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.950 align:middle line:90%
that needs to happen.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's not observing
everybody else through Pinterest

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
things, Instagram.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:90%
It's observing yourself.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And how can
we protect ourselves

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:84%
from these negative
waves that may or may not

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.040 align:middle line:90%
cause harm to us?

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: The easiest
way is strategic withdrawal.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.441 align:middle line:90%
And what that means is--

00:27:15.441 --> 00:27:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Besides
going under a-- you

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.480 align:middle line:84%
know, building an underground
facility with 6 feet of lead.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.354 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --no.

00:27:20.354 --> 00:27:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Take time to yourself.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Take time to yourself in
a space that let's say

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.310 align:middle line:84%
is not exposed to the
elements and to the air.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And so to be in a
building like at the gym.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:84%
They're generally
pretty well built,

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
block a lot of it, right?

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And so it should become
that you become relaxed,

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.164 align:middle line:90%
like in your home.

00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You should be able to
go home, become relaxed.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're relaxed, your inner
field has a chance to expand.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you're under attack, the
thing that we try to override

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
is your desire to contract
your energy field.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.367 align:middle line:84%
If you're under attack, you
need to expand your energy.

00:28:00.367 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You need to move.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: But it's
a natural phenomenon

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.420 align:middle line:90%
that people want to shrink down.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Remember the guy
getting shot at.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.310 align:middle line:84%
His partner wants to
shrink down out of fear.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And we want to do
the exact opposite.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.439 align:middle line:84%
We want to have a
bigger inner field

00:28:12.439 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:84%
so we can have a better
chance at survival.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And this applies whether
it's EMF or bullets

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.374 align:middle line:84%
or whatever is
coming down the pike.

00:28:19.374 --> 00:28:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, thank you,
Randy, for coming onto the show,

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and can't wait to have
you back next time.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: You're welcome.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.478 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That was a fascinating
discussion with Randy

00:28:27.478 --> 00:28:29.800 align:middle line:84%
on some of the hidden
senses of the human body

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.720 align:middle line:90%
and how they can be activated.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Hope to see you in
the next episode.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Emery Smith.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.910 align:middle line:90%
And remember, stay vigilant.

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]
