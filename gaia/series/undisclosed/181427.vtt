00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Hi.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm Emery Smith, and
I have been involved

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.220 align:middle line:10%
in undisclosed projects
within the government.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:10%
And today, I wanted to sit down
with a colleague and mentor

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:10%
of mine, Randy Veitenheimer.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for coming, Randy.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.560 align:middle line:10%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
Pleasure to be here.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Some of the
most interesting devices

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and scientific advancements,
through my experience anyway,

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.610 align:middle line:84%
has basically all been reverse
engineered alien reproduction

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
things, such as
craft and devices,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even the
common computer today

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:90%
and cell phone technologies.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So through your
experiences, Randy,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.047 align:middle line:84%
what have you seen and noticed
that you could talk about?

00:01:01.047 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: To
me, the easiest one

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:90%
would be to start with lasers.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Lasers kind of
burst on the scene.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And around 1963,
there was a monograph

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that was printed
at Yale University

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:90%
in the spring of '63.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:90%
I believe that's true.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
get a copy of it.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And that summer, a friend
of mine and I read it.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.780 align:middle line:90%
We were both 13.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:90%
And so we built a laser.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
What was interesting about it
is we didn't have much money

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and cobbled together
some battery

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.550 align:middle line:84%
packs from old
Graflex 500 cameras.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:90%
We got the flash tubes out.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:90%
We ordered a ruby rod synthetic.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Put the whole thing together.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So in the fall of
'63, my friend and I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:84%
invented a portable
laser, battery powered.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And people don't think about
the origins of all that.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:10%
But Russell Targ didn't
build his until like January,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:10%
because I asked him.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:10%
I said, hey, Russell, you're
kind of late to the game.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:84%
You came in on
January after that.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.262 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, I know.

00:02:12.262 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was Stanford
Research Institute.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
now it becomes

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:84%
something of a phenomenon that
the scientific establishment

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.925 align:middle line:84%
and the military and
everybody wants in on it.

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
what we were doing

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
was popping balloons at
100 feet with our laser.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.870 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing
about that is the technology

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:90%
appeared.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like you date
pre '63 no lasers OK?

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's technology that's
basically working on sound.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:90%
That was Bell Labs and all that.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
And then the switch

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.640 align:middle line:90%
occurred to work on light.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to ask like,
why are we working on light now?

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Where did that whole
concept come from?

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly, I don't think,
originated with the scientist,

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and I can't remember
his name, that

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:90%
wrote that monograph at Yale.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: But so if
it didn't come from him,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
then you have to start asking
like, what kind of sources

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
would finally put
out information

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:84%
enough to be able to
create that technology

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:90%
and bring it into reality?

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the biggest problems

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
I have with
theoretical scientist

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
is that they should all
be married to an engineer.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.763 align:middle line:84%
Because without an engineer,
it's just all talk, talk, talk.

00:03:32.763 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: So
I was one of those

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:84%
that I'd look at something
and I wanted to make one.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.300 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:90%
And that started pretty early.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
the technologies

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:90%
that I became enamored with.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Could you say that's
maybe these technologies

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that these corporations
had may be acquired

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.620 align:middle line:84%
from maybe some downed craft or
something from un-Earth origin,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.927 align:middle line:84%
or even better yet,
something that was dug up?

00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Just
historically, you

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
go back to Helios, and
you go back to Egypt,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and they were doing
things with light.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know what
all they were doing.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
is every time you

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
have a thought or every
time you have an idea,

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
the question is, do you
have it or does it have you?

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Did that idea come to you?

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what Einstein said.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what Tesla, all of
them, they kept notebooks

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.950 align:middle line:90%
right beside their bed.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:84%
They said the
information came to them.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the things
I've been tracking is,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
how is that knowledge
accumulated?

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Who uploads it?

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.650 align:middle line:90%
And what's our access?

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:90%
So I came up with an idea.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I call it approximate
reality, the ability

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
to go into the morphic
field or into the collective

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and
actually pinpoint

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:90%
where that knowledge is.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And then if you go into ETs
or ancient civilizations

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:84%
either one, you have
to come to the point

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
that you realize they were
uploading that information.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Now people from the
past uploaded it.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:84%
People working today on
various science projects

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:90%
are uploading information.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And then why not other
cultures, others societies,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:90%
other civilizations?

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:90%
And there you go.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Now they have loaded that
information into the field.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:90%
So why don't we access that?

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And because nobody ever
thought about accessing it

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:90%
as a database.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
They just think
about it as something

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:84%
out there that, all of a
sudden, I had a brilliant idea.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.345 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, it was all mine.

00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:36.178 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah,
it was all mine, yeah.

00:05:36.178 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Or I read a something.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
How long do you think
here, just on planet Earth,

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that these things were
probably hanging out maybe not

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:90%
discovered yet, but are there?

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: The problem
is the cyclical nature

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.030 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.762 align:middle line:90%
We go around the sun every year.

00:05:53.762 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
We come back to more or
less the same position.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a
spiral, but same day.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
It's Groundhog Day
all over again.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And we don't think about that
if I saw a laser the first time,

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and let's say it
was 100 years ago,

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:90%
I'd have no language for it.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.704 align:middle line:84%
In the same way a speaker or
a TV or anything like that.

00:06:17.704 --> 00:06:18.504 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:06:18.504 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:90%
It would be witchcraft.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.305 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:06:20.305 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
But every one of
those is a technology

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:90%
that somebody couldn't explain.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And even if they did, it
was in their local language.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way to know
exactly what they knew.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.712 align:middle line:84%
We find little pieces
of it in archeology.

00:06:36.712 --> 00:06:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
archeology hides all

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that because it
disrupts the narrative.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And that narrative is
practiced like our scientists.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:90%
They do progression.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:90%
They do not do invention.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
They do not do leaps
of consciousness.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:84%
We say all inventions come
from outside of the discipline.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Because once you have
a laser, now Los Alamos

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else
got in the game.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:90%
And oh, we can use it for this.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:90%
And we can make gas lasers.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And we can make this
laser and that laser.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And all those technologies
then look for an application.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think the applications
over history have been there.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:84%
I just don't think
that anybody's

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:84%
alive to talk about it or
there are any records of it.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take the
scientific community

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
throughout history, it literally
evolved into a priesthood.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And don't think that
science today hasn't

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:90%
evolved into a priesthood.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Because they're in the process
of creating their own gods,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.120 align:middle line:90%
like AI and different things.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Coming from within.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yep.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.403 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Instead of saying, oh,
we're getting it from out here

00:07:42.403 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:84%
or there, most of
this information

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
is accessible from you yourself
because you are everything.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: The language
is, I didn't invent this.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:84%
The language is, it
was available to me

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.495 align:middle line:84%
through whatever process and
through whatever connections.

00:08:00.495 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And really, I
think all knowledge

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:90%
comes through connections.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's like
an intuitive thing.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:10%
I think it more on the order
of what Sheldrake talks about

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:10%
is a field of knowledge that
you stumbled into, bumped

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:10%
your head, got drunk that
night, did something.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.233 align:middle line:84%
And all you knew is you wrote
down a formula that night.

00:08:18.233 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And the next
morning, you're like,

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:90%
hmm, let's see how this works.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So how are
these ET technologies

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:84%
merging with the
technologies we have today?

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.980 align:middle line:90%
And where's it going?

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And how did it begin?

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: It's
actually pretty easy.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.650 align:middle line:90%
It's always been there.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
If you take the
concept that there's

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.570 align:middle line:84%
been prior civilizations, if
you extend it, and time kind

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.370 align:middle line:84%
of runs both
directions and physics,

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:84%
then there's civilizations
that are out ahead of us.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And then if you throw
time out the window,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
we're kind of involved
in all of them at once.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.870 align:middle line:90%
That's current theory.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you take a look at
that, then all knowledge

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:84%
that comes to us
is pre-existing.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So the entire concept of,
I created this or thought

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.890 align:middle line:84%
of this, becomes kind
of like, well, maybe,

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:84%
but you created it from
a body of knowledge

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:90%
that already exists.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Its potential exists.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:84%
I think this gets into like
D-wave technology on AI

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and some other things we're not
going to get into right now.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And
multidimensional existence.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.373 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:09:24.373 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And so when we acquire that
knowledge, we're front running.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:84%
If you take the existing
technology of today,

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:84%
obviously, our
research scientists

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
are front running
that knowledge.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to extend it.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
But they're not jumping
out ahead necessarily

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:90%
to bring in the next technology.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I think things
like the discovery of artifacts

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and different sources
of information

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:84%
that have been
largely ignored, which

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that consciousness
itself explores the universe.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not just like we want to
send people out in spaceships.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.970 align:middle line:84%
We send our consciousness
out all the time.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that, and if
there are other civilizations,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:84%
then there would be an
exchange of information.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you read the history
about in the Mediterranean,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:84%
when it started, there
was all this trade.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And trade was trade
of information.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.560 align:middle line:90%
It was trade of technology.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.470 align:middle line:90%
It was trade of materials.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.260 align:middle line:84%
It was trade of
manufactured products.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:84%
What makes you think that's
changed in 3,000 years?

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's the
same thing that

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.320 align:middle line:84%
would happen with any other
race that we would encounter

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.850 align:middle line:90%
or any other civilization.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
beginning of it.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
It won't be like, hey, let's
exchange Facebook posts.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:90%
See you on Instagram.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Nobody
addresses all that.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
They just, ah, there's
this technology.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
civilization behind it.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of things
in medicine we say,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.463 align:middle line:90%
it's not the disease you have.

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:84%
I want to know
what kind of person

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:90%
you are to have a disease.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So it gets into the
same kind of ideas.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.260 align:middle line:84%
It's we want to have the
technology because it improves

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:90%
our abilities.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
It extends our
range of experience.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
It allows for
evolution or growth.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, it's
like people that

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:84%
want to hide that
are like criminals.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
We see this every
day as far as, look

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:84%
at this technology
from the first iPhone

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:84%
to iPhone whatever it is,
10X, in such a fast time

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.953 align:middle line:84%
because they already
have iPhone 100X.

00:11:48.953 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they don't want
it to be released this quickly

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:90%
because there's no money.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
At what point do
you think that might

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:84%
happen where enough
will be enough,

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and we will get to a point to
allow the newer technologies

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:90%
to be released a little faster?

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: The problem
becomes that the process

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.080 align:middle line:90%
is well ingrained.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, on that iPhone
one, two, three, four, five,

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.660 align:middle line:90%
six, and here we go.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.720 align:middle line:84%
If you examine
it, the technology

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:84%
has to be there ahead
of the actual product.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:90%
So we have a lead time.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And those lead times
produce different products.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Different technologies are
able to be incorporated

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:84%
into what we see and what we
do and how we do with things.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that it's,
again, it's a progression.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.930 align:middle line:84%
They've locked
onto a progression,

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.900 align:middle line:84%
even though they may
have stepped out there

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:90%
10 generations ahead.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And it gets into the same
thing as our physics.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.720 align:middle line:84%
We operate like, OK,
Newtonian physics.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Then we go to
Einsteinian physics.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Then we go to quantum physics.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And now they're into
subquantum physics.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But there's more
physics out there.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.295 align:middle line:90%
And those are being dealt with.

00:13:09.295 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:90%
They're being investigated.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have
knowledge of them.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.110 align:middle line:90%
They're not disseminated.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the answer
to your question

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:84%
is all the outsiders out
there, like I know ones

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:84%
with zero technology, zero
energy technology and all

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:90%
this other stuff.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.080 align:middle line:84%
They're out there
inventing it right now.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just that
nobody knows them.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't get any press on it.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:84%
They don't get
any funding on it.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.357 align:middle line:84%
And generally, the ones
that do and you get noticed

00:13:34.357 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
they're talking about.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And who do you
think is the mass controller

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:90%
of that tech?

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: I think
it's more of a group.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, at
a certain level,

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.370 align:middle line:90%
you can point to an individual.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
But at some point

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.340 align:middle line:84%
there's a very interesting
thing in the state of Colorado

00:13:54.340 --> 00:14:00.220 align:middle line:84%
there's 70 aerospace contractors
OK that's just in the Colorado

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Springs Denver area.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.900 align:middle line:84%
In the world there are
about 70 space agencies.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.560 align:middle line:84%
You have countries
out there that

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:84%
have their own space agency
that don't have maybe

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:90%
roads or something.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.173 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: But if you
take all that together,

00:14:15.173 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at about
2.4 million people

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:84%
are involved in space, space
exploration, space technology.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to me
that they use the word space

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
because, again, we're back
into that approximate reality

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:84%
of an infinite knowledge
field that we all tap into.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So out of those
2.4 million people,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
how many of them know
something we don't?

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:84%
How many of them know something
or know a progression that

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:84%
extends our ability to
leapfrog from a basic computer

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to a Mac or to a
D-3 computer or an AI computer.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because recently,
they're slowly coming out with,

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:84%
well, we can teletransport
this atom over

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:90%
to this area over here.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And can you explain
teletransportation on the Earth

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.438 align:middle line:84%
scientific level now, before we
get into the ET level of that?

00:15:14.438 --> 00:15:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: They're
giving you old knowledge.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
You might as well

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
be watching black
and white TV as far

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:84%
as the technology
they're presenting to us.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:22.700 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, they did
that back in "Star Trek."

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah,
all the programs.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
The thing about "Star
Trek" and "Star Wars"

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and all the other science
fiction movies is they

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
were presenting
their imagination.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And now it's taken
50 years to catch up

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.200 align:middle line:90%
with their imagination.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you need
not creative thinking,

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:84%
but you need what
they call makers now.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I call them creators
just for fun.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's that marriage again
of the idea and an engineer,

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
somebody who actually
like, let me sit down.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Give me a little
warehouse or a garage.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Let me put these
things together.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
But the technology
is very simple.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.143 align:middle line:84%
We've gone beyond
20 years ago, I

00:16:07.143 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
think is when they first
did the teleportation

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:90%
of the atoms and stuff.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And people, they want to
go, well, explain all that.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:90%
And I go, no.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Go do your homework.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't have time
to explain all that.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:90%
But you can go look it up.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you take from where
that was to where we are now,

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:84%
now you're getting into a fifth
level physics of translation.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Because when you move that
atom to the other space,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:90%
you have translated space.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.780 align:middle line:90%
That's translation physics.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:84%
It's something not
very well talked about

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:84%
because there is no reason
to create a chemical rocket.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:84%
You can do translation physics
and go from here to there.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And I have experiences of
that and could talk about that

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:90%
some time.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you go into
transformation physics.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
the next level.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when we look at
any kind of civilization, ET,

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
anything like that, we're seeing
transformation and translation

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:90%
physics at work.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.819 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at the
progression of physics,

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.490 align:middle line:84%
just like we look at the
progression of an iPhone

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and the current model,
it's like you're

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:84%
seeing just a current perceptual
model of the universe.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And we've abandoned four
or five of them already.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But what makes you
think that DARPA

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and various other
corporations and stuff are not

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.237 align:middle line:84%
working at physics level six,
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12,

00:17:27.237 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:90%
13, 14, 15?

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I think the current level
of physics is level 15.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that everything between
here and there is hidden.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I think it's unavailable
except it's all in the field.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:84%
If they've had a
thought about it,

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:84%
if they produced a prototype,
that information is available.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:90%
And you can tap into that field.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.910 align:middle line:84%
You can tap into that knowledge
because it occurs and comes

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
to other people who are
outside of those domains,

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:90%
outside of those organizations.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And those are the ones that
are inventing zero energy

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:90%
technology, zero point energy.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
Those are the ones

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.890 align:middle line:84%
that are taking lasers and
making them into things

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.070 align:middle line:90%
that are tools for health.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't the corporations.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the military
that was doing that.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.450 align:middle line:84%
They were looking at strictly
military application.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:84%
But back to the
Mediterranean, trade

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
was the deal, knowledge and
trade and things that made life

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:90%
either more fun or more better.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right, right.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:30.153 align:middle line:84%
What I've noticed is
whatever that computer

00:18:30.153 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:84%
is that you're looking
at, like you said

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:38.750 align:middle line:84%
was the iPhone, that's just
a dimension of a frequency

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:90%
of a form of a sound.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And the best way I could put
it is frequency and form.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
Yeah, I mean, you're

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:90%
talking transformation physics.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
ability to transform

00:18:55.130 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:84%
substances, which is originally
called alchemy or chemical.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And but then if you
move it right along,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.670 align:middle line:84%
it's the ability to manipulate
the fields to produce

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Rain would be an idea.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans
did a rain dance.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:84%
They manipulated the
field and made it rain.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:90%
That's transformation physics.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And it was
done through vibration.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
It was done through sound
and through consciousness.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's really,
a thunderstorm

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:90%
is just it's this big.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:90%
It's so small, but it's there.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
What was the most interesting
tech or experiment or thing

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that you have seen on
the Earth as an outsider

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.610 align:middle line:84%
looking in on some
of these projects,

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and also just being
through all the stuff

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.660 align:middle line:90%
that you've been involved with?

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Well, a couple
of things, local reality.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:56.060 align:middle line:84%
If you go out on the res,
I lived there as a kid,

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.060 align:middle line:90%
reality is a lot different.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that
we use computers here,

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:84%
but they might not
be used in Ecuador

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:90%
or in the jungle somewhere.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:84%
It would be beyond those people
to even have any concept of it.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at local
reality then, what happens

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.850 align:middle line:84%
is realize there are
no laws of physics.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I hate that when
they come up, well,

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:84%
these are laws of
physics, Newtonian laws,

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Einsteinian laws.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And then it's just
like you went out there

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.655 align:middle line:90%
and it was written in stone.

00:20:29.655 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:90%
And then they throw those away.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they throw away
and another one comes in.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.022 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah, and
then we have a new one.

00:20:35.022 --> 00:20:37.765 align:middle line:84%
But I think a precursor would
have to be Native Americans.

00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And
in particular, I

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:90%
use an example of the Zunis.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:90%
The Zunis do something.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.520 align:middle line:90%
They do a blessing ceremony.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.320 align:middle line:90%
It lasts.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:90%
For three days.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I could beat out
the rhythm of it

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:84%
because it's banged into
my head after three days.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:58.650 align:middle line:84%
But what they did was
a group of people,

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.130 align:middle line:84%
the medicine man and
others got together.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And for three days, they blessed
about 250,000 square miles.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
They bless their land to
grow crops, to have rain,

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:90%
to be productive.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And of all the ET things we
hear about, nobody ever comes

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
up and says, hey,
let me bless you.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.682 align:middle line:84%
Let me make your crops
grow, or let me--

00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:84%
we talk about crop circles,
but they don't want

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:90%
to talk about making crops go.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
They talk about all
this technology.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But never once do they say,
you could be healthier.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Where's the technology that
would come out of that?

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So everybody becomes
fascinated with their toys

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and not realizing that
there is a human hand that

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.770 align:middle line:84%
is not only involved in it, but
is there to benefit from it.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again,
that's the crime

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:84%
of withholding that technology
whatever its source.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:90%
That was my next question.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:90%
You answered it.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Is it's an educational that
has to do with both the science

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual realm.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.460 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't you say?

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes, definitely.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:84%
The science comes
out of the spiritual.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:90%
There's no way to separate it.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of making
AI a god or some

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.460 align:middle line:84%
of the technology what I
call have godlike attributes

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.060 align:middle line:90%
is a perversion.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.240 align:middle line:84%
It takes it away from the
fact that we're human beings.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And that our
consciousness has literally

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:90%
been our resource.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.860 align:middle line:84%
It has been that which has
allowed us to develop and get

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:90%
to this point.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:84%
What I think is that all
technology that's out there,

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.910 align:middle line:84%
including that which comes
from the future, is extant.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.160 align:middle line:90%
It's available.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the
techniques to be

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:84%
able to access that information,
you have to do some training.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Like I did all that
training I've done with you.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: But it's
like that kind of training

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.663 align:middle line:84%
allows you access
to that information

00:22:56.663 --> 00:22:57.580 align:middle line:90%
no matter where it is.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:90%
There are no secrets.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And so if you take about
2.4 million people that

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.910 align:middle line:84%
are opposing the release and
advancement of things that

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:10.620 align:middle line:84%
would help humanity, we're
sitting here with 500,000,

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:16.020 align:middle line:84%
say, believers that, as a
group, they have no coherence.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:84%
They have not got into the
creator phase, the creator

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:90%
and the engineering together.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's available
to everybody.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It only takes you and two other
people and go make a laser.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Go make anything.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.413 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Form the idea
and the idea is real.

00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:90%
And then find somebody to play.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the language.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way I've
approached all this.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:90%
To me, it was all play.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.690 align:middle line:84%
From creating the lasers
to building rockets

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
to building nuclear reactors,
all this stuff is just play.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: As long
as it has a purpose

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to improve humanity,
I'm all for it.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:84%
But if its purpose is
strictly for profit,

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.610 align:middle line:90%
then it needs to be hidden.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why today, you see
all the technology's hidden

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:84%
because it's strictly
a matter of profits.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not a function
of the people.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:11.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not a function of humanity.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating, Randy.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm your host Emery Smith.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And until next
time, stay vigilant.
