>>EMERY SMITH: Hi, I'm
your host, Emery Smith.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever wondered
what the etheric field

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.210 align:middle line:10%
and the atomic field is
and how to define it?

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean to be
connected to the etheric field?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.521 align:middle line:90%
And how can you control it?

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:84%
These are just some
of the questions

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.519 align:middle line:84%
we will be answering today with
my guest, Randy Veitenheimer

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Randy, thanks for
coming on the show.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
Good to see you.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: While in
the projects, Randy,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:84%
they were measuring all
sorts of fields of energy

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:90%
from light, to sound, to scalar.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of these fields were
called the atomic fields.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And they were measuring them
on different types of craft

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and different types
of beings and also

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
designing devices to measure
this amount of force.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.592 align:middle line:84%
In your experience, what
is this atomic field?

00:01:03.592 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:10%
>>VEITENHEIMER: What
I think is happening

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:10%
and what I think
you are observing

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.090 align:middle line:10%
was our scientists
coming to understand

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:10%
that all physical matter
has a vibratory effect

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:10%
on its surroundings.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So that vibratory
effect can be measured.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
If we take it as atomic
particles, subatomic particles,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.470 align:middle line:90%
they're in constant movement.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And because of that movement,
they are creating a signature,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and they're creating
an energy field.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to be
interacting with something,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:84%
you would want to
be in either close

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:84%
proximity or in
the same signature

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:90%
line of that particular item.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:90%
This is true in the plant world.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.230 align:middle line:90%
It's true in the animal world.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.830 align:middle line:90%
And we can call it a propensity.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:84%
We can call it a
preference so that it's not

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
just that you like
your dog, or you

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:84%
like a certain animal, or even
a certain type of aircraft.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: It's that
you have an affinity with it.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:84%
And that affinity is that it's
vibrating a certain signature,

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:90%
and you are too.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Or you are reciprocal to
it and responding to it.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I look at this
atomic field as more of us

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and the matrix as the 3D
structure of something

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
that we can measure
because that's

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:84%
what they can do now with atoms,
and electrons, and protons.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that it
also has a correlation.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Because beyond that, then you
get into this etheric field,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.960 align:middle line:84%
where you can go
from the subatomic

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.194 align:middle line:84%
and into this new field of
energy that people talk about.

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What is
this etheric field

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.230 align:middle line:84%
that they go from this 3D,
and then, now, this energy

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
is somehow connected
or transforms

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:90%
into this etheric field as well?

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Well, if we
go to history, somewhere back

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
in time, science became enamored
with the physical world,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:90%
the physical sciences.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And if it's
not a physical science,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:90%
then it's woo-woo.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
That's a Chinese
term, by the way.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And actually, woo-woo refers
to the higher energies

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:84%
of the human body,
which is interesting.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things they did is

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
they kept going
smaller and smaller

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and smaller and in the atomic
world or in the physical world.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
you run out of matter.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
you run into fields.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Can these fields,
such as the etheric field,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
actually reciprocate or
reverse, come back into 3D

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:90%
and affect you.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, at that point,
around the turn of the century,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.060 align:middle line:84%
they came up with
quantum mechanics.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And quantum mechanics said that
there was particles and waves.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And you could influence
that particular property

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:90%
of its existence by observation.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:90%
This is quantum mechanics.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you take that further,
the information that I think

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:84%
they left out, or
didn't focus on,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:90%
was the power of the observer.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Your powers of observation have
a direct effect on the field.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Think about just
looking at somebody

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:90%
or looking at something.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
You're having a field
interaction with them.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, I've noticed
this transition while

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
in the projects where they
were trying to build devices

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.352 align:middle line:90%
to measure these fields.

00:04:39.352 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
trying to figure out--

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.659 align:middle line:84%
because there were
some people that--

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:84%
everyone has it, but
there were some people

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
that were more gifted with
it to sense these things

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:90%
and give readings.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
3D aspects of this?

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:90%
How did they measure it?

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.565 align:middle line:90%
What were they using?

00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I see these gigantic
devices down underground

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:84%
that was used to measure
different types of fields.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Through your experience, have
you seen any type of device

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:90%
that measures these?

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes, to
answer your question.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.990 align:middle line:10%
Last year, they gave
a Nobel science award

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.020 align:middle line:10%
to a couple of
scientists that had

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:10%
detected gravitational waves.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So at the bottom end of
let's call it wave theory,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:84%
this was a goal, to be able
to detect these things.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that those
detectors employ detectors

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:84%
both above ground
and deep under Earth.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: So
the isolation is

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.500 align:middle line:84%
to isolate and be able to
identify those types of waves.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we
developed Geiger counters

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.905 align:middle line:84%
to measure atomic
particle emissions.

00:05:51.905 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we have EMF
devices that measure fields.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is, human
beings are sensitive to them.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Animals are sensitive to them.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So there is also some innate
either structure or function

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.480 align:middle line:84%
in humanity and
animals, even plants,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that allows them to interact,
interpret, and identify

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic waves
or etheric fields.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Why is it so
important, this etheric field,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.470 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, off planet,
in our own system of energy,

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.969 align:middle line:84%
and light spectrums,
and things like this?

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the positive things?

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.940 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:90%
What is it used for?

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:90%
What can we use it for?

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:10%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
Back in the '70s,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:10%
there was a book written
called "Secret Life of Plants."

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:10%
And Peter Tompkins, Marcel Vogel
were instrumental in that book.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And I studied with
Marcel Vogel, and we

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.300 align:middle line:90%
started talking about this.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that came
up was field communication.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:84%
We think about talking to
someone or writing someone.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:90%
These are physical acts.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
But there's field
communication going on.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.680 align:middle line:84%
There's information
being shared.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
comments that came up

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.250 align:middle line:84%
was, what if California
falls in the ocean, right?

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ladies
there said, well,

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:84%
you would know it
was going to happen

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.240 align:middle line:84%
because the etheric
field would disappear.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm going
to shift on you.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I worked on a recent client
who had delivered a baby.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And we measured her
etheric field, the mother.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we measured the
etheric field of the child.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And a child is born with
a large etheric field.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: How can
you regulate that?

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: There's
a lot of different ways.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, least effort
would be to be happy.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:90%
Positivity.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.173 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:07:52.173 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
A happy person, a joyful person,
their etheric field is larger.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.570 align:middle line:84%
In a human being, it extends
about two or three inches

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:90%
above the physical form.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And people can see this is.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:84%
This is where we give
rise the idea of auras

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:90%
and electromagnetic fields.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:90%
But there's a lot more to it.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:90%
That's just the first layer.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Your etheric layer
is your first layer.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But when it disappears,
then you're sick.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:84%
When it disappears, you
do not have the ability

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:84%
to function at
your highest level.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And definitely, through
yoga, martial arts,

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of secret martial
arts that deal with this.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is techniques
that develop

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
to increase the density
and the information

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:84%
density of that field
and to be able to utilize

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:34.659 align:middle line:90%
that in your daily life.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:35.459 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:08:35.459 --> 00:08:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Because you're susceptible
to these fields daily

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.466 align:middle line:84%
that are negatively
affecting us.

00:08:39.466 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.673 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And
negatively affecting

00:08:41.673 --> 00:08:42.984 align:middle line:90%
our genetic structure actually.

00:08:42.984 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually true because
the depletion of the energy

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:84%
field likely increases your
sensitivity and malleability

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
of your atomic structure
and your own physical cells.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that science is just

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
now kind of like coming
out and playing with.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
But really, field research got
kicked to the curb back in the,

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I would say, the '20s or
'30s with the perversion

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:84%
of Maxwell's equations, which
dealt with field equations.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:90%
And they got modified.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And they don't actually
produce the information

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
that we would need to be more
conversant, more knowledgeable

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.380 align:middle line:90%
about those fields.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I know you've taught and spoken
in many different underground

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.210 align:middle line:84%
projects and were associated
with these types of things

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.400 align:middle line:90%
back in the day.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And even you and I meeting
and some of the training

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I received from
you helped so much

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.622 align:middle line:84%
in increasing the
etheric field by--

00:09:43.622 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:84%
what's the best way we
could talk to the people

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.590 align:middle line:84%
about increasing
your etheric field?

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Besides being happy,
there's other avenues

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:84%
we could use to
teach these people.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Well,
all forms of movement

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.580 align:middle line:84%
increase the flow of
energy through the body.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.070 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of emotions
decrease the flow of energy

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just to increase it.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
We tell people, you should
listen to what you say

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:90%
and you should see yourself.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So we should hear ourselves,
and we should see ourselves.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:84%
This also a Native
American teaching.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And the idea behind
it is the more aware

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:84%
you are of what you
say, and particularly,

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.850 align:middle line:84%
in a positive or
negative manner.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way,
you see yourself.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.410 align:middle line:90%
You see yourself moving.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of
gymnastics, martial arts,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:90%
ballet is smoother movement.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
That represents an integration
of mind, body, and the brain.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:90%
So any exercise like that.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, to get into
specific exercises,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
it gets into
certain disciplines,

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:90%
and it gets into the individual.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.040 align:middle line:90%
It becomes subjective.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's hard to tell
people that you should do this

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:84%
or that because it
depends on your age.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:84%
It depends a lot
of circumstances.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.087 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's positive and
negative parts to this too.

00:11:08.087 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It could be
used for other things.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.583 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:13.767 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Could you maybe
give us some examples

00:11:13.767 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:90%
through your experience on that?

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Well, you become
projective of consciousness.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that people
generally don't think about

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:84%
is that, actually, words
do hurt, or words do help.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.497 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: As a form?

00:11:27.497 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a old language.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a thought form.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And we can energize
a thought form.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
We can energize a
thought in our mind.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we can displace that
thought, or we can send it on.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're in
direct communication

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.620 align:middle line:84%
with that other person at a
level beyond just speaking.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.660 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
field interactive.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So people that are together
for a long period of time

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:84%
become homogeneous in
their field interactions.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
They understand each
other, we would say.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of that comes
about through practice.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So what I teach is
discipline is what

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.000 align:middle line:90%
would allow you to do that.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And which discipline
depends on the person.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things
out there in martial arts,

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.500 align:middle line:90%
yoga, meditation.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:84%
All those things allow you to
determine what is best for you.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've noticed
in our trainings

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:84%
that these 3D atomic
particles around us that

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.110 align:middle line:84%
are always bombarding
us are actually weapons.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And I also believe the
voice, sound, is a weapon.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Me talking to someone,
or yelling at them,

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.604 align:middle line:84%
or cursing them can actually
break your etheric field.

00:12:41.604 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And so there's--

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.208 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
important for everyone

00:12:45.208 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:84%
to know that these techniques
that you are speaking of

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.760 align:middle line:84%
can actually up
regulate this field.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:90%
But it can also break it down.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.513 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes,
that's definitely true.

00:12:56.513 --> 00:12:59.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that happens
is when you speak to a person,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
you're not just
transferring information,

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:90%
you're transferring an emotion.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.690 align:middle line:84%
You're transferring things
that are outside the intellect.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Hey, what time is it?

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.300 align:middle line:90%
Nice day.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you speak normally,
the communication, we'd say,

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:90%
is open and free-flowing.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you put emotion
into it, you have ramped it up.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
put emotion in it,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:84%
particularly a negative
emotion, then it

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:90%
becomes what I call a spell.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.375 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: It's like you're
putting a spell on the person.

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to influence
them with your own thoughts.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And get a reaction.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:90%
And your own position.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: To defeat them.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.181 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: But
if we keep going,

00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
let's say I put not only
negative energy into it

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:90%
but I put negative words.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.370 align:middle line:90%
I start cursing.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have the original
definition of a curse.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.210 align:middle line:84%
A curse was something
that had a lot of energy

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.610 align:middle line:90%
in it and of a negative state.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I take that and
project it at a person.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
yell at somebody,

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
when you put a lot
of curse words in it,

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:84%
you are literally
cursing that person.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:84%
If that person has a weak
or normal energy field,

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.760 align:middle line:84%
they will be susceptible to
the changes in direction.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And the outcome will
be that they either

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:84%
experience what you're
projecting at them,

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.440 align:middle line:84%
or they weaken
their field so much

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.440 align:middle line:84%
that the next available
pathogen, or cold, or flu bug

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:90%
that comes along, they get it.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, I don't
know how I got the flu.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, it may not
you got the flu.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:84%
You may have an argument with
your girlfriend, or your wife,

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.541 align:middle line:84%
or your husband, or
boyfriend, or something.

00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:84%
You may have an argument
with your child or your boss.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And all these are
field weakening.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, we would
want to do some very simple

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:84%
techniques to be able to
restore, regain, or increase

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:90%
their energy.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I can completely
attest to that, because working

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
in the underground
facilities, I actually

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:90%
had to go onto this platform.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Before going into
any room, there

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.400 align:middle line:84%
was an extraterrestrial
to make sure

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that I was at peace
with myself and not

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.140 align:middle line:90%
angry from the night before.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they taught
us later on how to do that.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And you have taught me how
to do this by meditation,

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and clearing your emotions,
and getting them out.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Because this device you stand
on somehow helps get rid of--

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:84%
it resets your emotion, kind of
like how we reset our emotion.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go
into this field

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:84%
or into this room with this
extraterrestrial who picks up

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:84%
on every little
thing, it could damage

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.077 align:middle line:84%
the relationship and the
communication of telepathy.

00:15:39.077 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.785 align:middle line:84%
What happened, the
machine you're standing on

00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:90%
is a grounding machine.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is
it's field interactive

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.850 align:middle line:84%
with your own
electromagnetic field.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And before you can
talk to somebody--

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:84%
even in everyday life, we
would call it a full reset.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:90%
You would ground yourself.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:90%
You would center yourself.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:90%
This is martial arts.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's bandied about,
but not a lot of people

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:90%
know the exact techniques.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But in centering yourself,
you would be yourself.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And you would not have any
particular emotional state

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:84%
because any emotional
state's going to interfere

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:90%
with your ability to perceive.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:90%
We call it bias.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:84%
You have a field bias
that is negative in nature

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:84%
because you're experiencing
an emotional reaction

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:84%
when you should be strictly at
an intellectual or above level

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness in
those interactions.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Is there
anything out there

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:84%
that you are aware
of in your experience

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that the government
or the corporations

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.230 align:middle line:84%
have that are affecting
our etheric fields daily

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:90%
amongst the larger cities?

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: You
know, around 1900,

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
they said that
there was basically

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:84%
only two or three
electromagnetic fields that

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.480 align:middle line:84%
were extant and interactive
with a human being,

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.055 align:middle line:84%
and of course, the sun
being the major one.

00:17:02.055 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:90%
I disagree with that.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.364 align:middle line:84%
I think the entire
electromagnetic spectrum

00:17:06.364 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
would be primarily

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:90%
and the sun secondary.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.403 align:middle line:90%
But that's my opinion.

00:17:10.403 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I agree.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.265 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And when
we come off of that,

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:84%
then around 1900s when
we had telegraph wires.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And any wire that
transmits electricity

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
creates an
electromagnetic field.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And the field can be much larger
than amount of voltage that's

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.850 align:middle line:90%
flowing through the wire.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So what that means
is that if you're

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
standing next to those wires,
you could be affected by them.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And even today, as
we've progressed up

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:90%
through the satellites--

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Telstar and things in the '60s--

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.585 align:middle line:84%
and then we got cell
phone towers, TV towers.

00:17:46.585 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we just keep adding on.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So the electromagnetic spectrum
has become highly populated.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
In this room right
here today, there's

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:84%
77 different
electromagnetic signatures

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:90%
flowing through the room--

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.360 align:middle line:90%
radio, TV, 4G, 5G.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:90%
It just goes on forever.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.924 align:middle line:84%
And the human being
electromagnetic field

00:18:08.924 --> 00:18:10.840 align:middle line:84%
is interactive with all
of them and really has

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:90%
no defenses against them.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:90%
We have become interactive.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:90%
We've become influenced.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have no knowledge
of where that leads

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:24.310 align:middle line:84%
or the evolutionary outcome
of those type of interactions.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:90%
We have more data now.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And the data is
electronically transmitted.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So we think more,
or have the ability

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:84%
to interact more with those
fields and those information

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's having an effect on us.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.655 align:middle line:84%
We obviously don't run
around in a copper suit.

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
next question is,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:84%
from the 3D atomic
field or the 3D matrix,

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:84%
what is there to affect
the etheric field?

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Or is there?

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Well, the
atomic, subatomic field,

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:90%
lead was--

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:06.229 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I noticed they started
putting lead in the cockpits

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:09.020 align:middle line:84%
only on airplanes because of
all the recent brain cancer that

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:09.820 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.236 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes, the cosmic
rays coming in at a higher

00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:90%
altitude have a greater impact.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's interesting.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
supplements, mineralization.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, a person has
a certain mineral balance

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
He's either going to be
more or less affected.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the type of research
that I've been doing lately.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we do need some sort
of not exactly protection,

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:84%
but ability to not be influenced
or affected by those fields.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, to
enhance those fields

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:90%
that your genetic DNA give off.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm very familiar with this.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.040 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my, also,
specialties, as you know.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's things
to actually increase

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:84%
the voltage of the etheric
field through that,

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:84%
taking different
minerals and supplements

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and things that affect
your body, your whole field

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:90%
as a whole.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:03.866 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:20:03.866 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the things is, we
have remote charging now.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.700 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
There's an electromagnetic
fields, static or standing

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.100 align:middle line:90%
wave, in your room.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.831 align:middle line:90%
And you lay your device on it.

00:20:17.831 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And now, you don't even have
to lay your device on it.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:90%
You can be 5 or 10 feet away.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.170 align:middle line:84%
The implication is,
well, we're no different.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.890 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is, we're
drawing another form of energy

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:90%
that I refer to as life force.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:84%
But we're constantly
recharged from five feet

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:90%
away or 10 feet away.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Some language would
be involved in that.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.410 align:middle line:90%
But that's really the idea.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:84%
The more life force
you have, the greater

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:84%
your resistance to outside
or inside influences.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Why are there some
3D atomic structures, devices

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and people, that have a
greater field than others?

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And why did they
give off these fields

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:84%
stronger than other
things in comparison?

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.387 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: It's the
idea of the sum of the parts

00:21:05.387 --> 00:21:06.470 align:middle line:90%
is greater than the whole.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:07.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:08.646 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right?

00:21:08.646 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that taking one
item and adding another item,

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.050 align:middle line:84%
we can calibrate up or
down either from its effect

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.820 align:middle line:90%
or interactiveness.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we throw
in another one.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And the whole time,
we're calibrating,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:90%
calibrating it up or down.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to determine
the benefit according

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.997 align:middle line:84%
to the outcome that
we're searching for.

00:21:31.997 --> 00:21:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Increasingly, the
etheric field, I think,

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.750 align:middle line:84%
is what everyone's
going to want to do--

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:84%
exercising, keeping the body in
movement, taking supplements.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Would you say these
are some of the things

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:84%
that we could utilize right
now, right out the door,

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.780 align:middle line:90%
after hearing this?

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:45.613 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:21:45.613 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:84%
But those are what we
call the beginning steps.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And
as you go along,

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle line:90%
people always ask, what next?

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.300 align:middle line:90%
What next?

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.631 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: But
one of the great things

00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:57.960 align:middle line:84%
about developing
your etheric field,

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:02.120 align:middle line:84%
you become more interactive
with the entire universe,

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.780 align:middle line:84%
universal field, whatever
you want to call it,

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:90%
the field of consciousness.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
become more knowing

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:84%
of what to do next, or who to
talk to, or what book to buy,

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
or what teacher or sensei to go
to that would help you along.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.555 align:middle line:84%
So it's everybody's
job to seek is

00:22:22.555 --> 00:22:24.740 align:middle line:84%
what we call it,
to seek out that

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:90%
which is beneficial to them.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:84%
How can these fields,
both atomic and etheric,

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.229 align:middle line:90%
be manipulated as a whole?

00:22:32.229 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I know that's an unlimited
question, because everything

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.587 align:middle line:90%
affects everything.

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:37.670 align:middle line:84%
But what are some of the
things in your experience

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:84%
that you notice affect these
fields the most in a person's

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.058 align:middle line:84%
just normal state,
the physical body?

00:22:43.058 --> 00:22:43.932 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Food.

00:22:43.932 --> 00:22:44.314 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Food?

00:22:44.314 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You are what you eat.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not only that.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the components
of that food.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And now, we go into the
chemistry of the body.

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.710 align:middle line:84%
There was a Nobel chemist
that I used to argue with.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And his definition of
life was chemistry,

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.240 align:middle line:84%
that all life is strictly
a chemical interaction.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And my response to
that, well, somebody

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.420 align:middle line:84%
had to put those
chemicals in proximity.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:90%
Somebody had to eat something.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's just on
the physical side.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, in my experience,
we call that chemogenesis,

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:20.410 align:middle line:90%
life from chemicals.

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.380 align:middle line:90%
And it leaves out--

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:84%
just like Einsteinian
physics, they

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:84%
hint at it in Rosen-Einstein
bridges and stuff.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
They do start getting
off into the fact

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that there's field
interactiveness.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And again, it amazes
me that there's not

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:90%
more available or public data.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Because anything that's
going to happen from here to

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:84%
the future is going to
be field interactions.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Always.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.505 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: That's it.

00:23:53.505 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Got it.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Whether
it's space travel,

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.840 align:middle line:84%
whether it's human health, field
interactions is where it's at.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe, Randy, that
the world's ready for this.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:84%
On a conscious level,
I think this science

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.110 align:middle line:84%
needs to be more
explained and taught,

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:84%
not be put off to the side as
some conspiracy theory type

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Because it has been measured.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:90%
There are ways to measure it.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:90%
It does exist.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.830 align:middle line:90%
The military is using it.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And the compartmentalized
projects and the corporations

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.690 align:middle line:90%
are utilizing this.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And I just think it's,
as a whole, something

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that we probably need
to keep revisiting.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:32.840 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Are the people ready for this?

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Oh, yes.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of things that
come into play at this point.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways we could
look at it is shelf space.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:84%
When you go into a
grocery store, everybody

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that's a vendor there
fights for shelf space.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And in our daily lives,
we fight for shelf space

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.560 align:middle line:84%
until we become comfortable
with what we're seeing.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So for somebody to
consider developing field

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
interactiveness or
field development,

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.170 align:middle line:84%
historically, it's been taught
from Yogananda in our country

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.070 align:middle line:84%
since 1900s and other
yoga techniques.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.360 align:middle line:90%
But there's a lot more.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.100 align:middle line:84%
The martial arts goes
back thousands of years

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and even further for
other disciplines.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is, you would
create some space for you

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.920 align:middle line:90%
to be able to explore this.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.550 align:middle line:84%
When people talk about,
well, I don't know this,

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.700 align:middle line:84%
or I don't understand it, you
haven't created enough space

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:90%
in your life to pursue it.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's very simple.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.990 align:middle line:84%
30 minutes a day to read
it or 30 minutes a day

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:90%
to do an exercise--

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.860 align:middle line:84%
all these things would
be beneficial to you.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
another problem.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And I refer to this as
algorithmic integrative

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:49.540 align:middle line:90%
programming.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:55.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that we are only
able to accept information

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:84%
provided to us in
a formal setting--

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:04.004 align:middle line:84%
universities, jobs, family
structures, socio-structures--

00:26:04.004 --> 00:26:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Which is
mostly disinformation.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: To help reprogram you.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Well, it
certainly fills up the space.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.294 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And
again, to break out

00:26:11.294 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:84%
of that would require
you to go, OK,

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.120 align:middle line:84%
I have learned all
these things in my life,

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's time
to learn something new,

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.210 align:middle line:90%
something that might benefit.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.066 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have
to do your research.

00:26:22.066 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's
what I'm getting.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
hearing out there

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:90%
from a lot of my colleagues.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.139 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the fans out
there are ready for this.

00:26:31.139 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a great
thing we had this conversation

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's raising
the consciousness,

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:84%
just speaking about it
right here in front of you.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:90%

on the importance of the
atomic and etheric fields

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and just how prevalent they
are in our day-to-day lives.
