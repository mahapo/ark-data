00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.680 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Hi.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm Emery Smith, and
I've been involved

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.300 align:middle line:10%
in some undisclosed projects
with the government.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:10%
And today, I wanted to sit down
with a colleague and mentor

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.970 align:middle line:10%
of mine, Randy Veitenheimer.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:84%
We'll be discussing some
interdimensional communication

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.440 align:middle line:84%
that Randy and I
have encountered

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:90%
over the years working together.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining us, Randy.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
Good morning.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Let's first
give a definition

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.020 align:middle line:84%
of, you know, what is, you know,
interdimensional, number one?

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
Interdimensional,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
intradimensional,
and extradimensional.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Those are kind of
like your choices.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:84%
They're the same choices
in the cells of your body.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
We have interdimensional
activity,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:84%
intradimensional
activity between cells,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
then we have extra, that
which exists outside of you.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you apply the
same terminology,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:84%
the concept that the
reality we're cognizant of

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:84%
would just represent
interdimensional.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.580 align:middle line:84%
It would not represent
intradimensional,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.520 align:middle line:84%
nor would it represent
extradimensional.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:84%
But we know those things exist
because of the experiences

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:90%
that people have.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.642 align:middle line:84%
And those experiences
manifest first

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:84%
as dreams or as
imagination, as creativity.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And then as we
expand on out, they

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
can enter into areas
that are populated,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
is what I refer to
it, so that each

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:84%
of the dimensional
categories can have

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.680 align:middle line:84%
their own rules, their own
laws, their own existences,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
their own populations, their
own deities, their own humans,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:84%
if that's what you want to
use, or their own animals,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And again, this has been
referred to through mythology,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle line:84%
through Native
American teachings.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And that is an awareness of the
extension of reality into areas

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.850 align:middle line:84%
that we may not have
scientific method to validate.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And I love that
because they might not

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
be able to be validated
scientifically,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.267 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't mean
they don't exist.

00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It might be
from another dimension,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.933 align:middle line:84%
the eighth dimension,
or whatever number you

00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
want to put on it, but
once it comes here,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:84%
it has to fall under the three
dimensional laws and rules

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.956 align:middle line:90%
of our dimension.

00:02:48.956 --> 00:02:52.037 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it has to take
that form, wouldn't you say?

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
it would have

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to take on the laws
of our perception.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're not receptive
to ultraviolet

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and a few other extensions
of the electromagnetic field,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't mean there's
not existence there.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you see things
you can't explain,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
the idea is that somehow you
have either traversed outward

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:84%
or they have traversed
inward to the point

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
point of contact.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And mythology-wise, they used
to call it the veil is lifted.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:84%
There's just all
these references

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:84%
about where people
have knowledge

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:84%
of things that don't have
physical existence as we

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.060 align:middle line:90%
know it.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that they don't
exist with some physicality,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:84%
because all consciousness,
once it manifests,

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.090 align:middle line:84%
has some physicality to it,
even if it's just photonic.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Even if it's just an electron.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So we don't think
about electrons

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
or subatomic particles
having consciousness,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:84%
but it's like if they
have a reality to them,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
they have consciousness, or
conscious exists within them.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So now, the same thing if
we were going to venture out

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:84%
in the universe
is why wouldn't we

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:84%
expect to see things that
are physical in nature,

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time why
would we be blind to the fact

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:84%
that it's much more
than we can perceive

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:84%
with the current
level of receptors

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:84%
that our physical
bodies are capable of.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right, our own senses.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.332 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You know,
having just five senses,

00:04:34.332 --> 00:04:36.730 align:middle line:84%
or some people say
six or seven, you

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.217 align:middle line:84%
know, with the pineal gland
and things like this, you know,

00:04:40.217 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:84%
do you think that has something
to do with having these,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, extraperceptional,
you know, visions?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: I refer to
it as an internal landscape.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And your internal landscape
can have a reference set

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:84%
that includes the ability to
hear, right, or see or talk

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:90%
to other species.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.750 align:middle line:90%
And I love that, all right?

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Because one of
those special forces students,

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.598 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Mhm.

00:05:15.598 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --one of the
things I told him one day,

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, you gotta
learn to talk to trees.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And
he's like, what?

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And so when he got
out of the military,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.175 align:middle line:84%
he went to a survival training
camp up in Washington.

00:05:28.175 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing the guy does,

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:84%
a wilderness training
camp, goes you

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:90%
need to learn to talk to trees.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, that's what
my teacher said, too.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So when people start
talking about talking

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
to extraterrestrials, there's
plenty of species here.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And communication
with them is something

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
that becomes something of
a fantasy to most people.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But most people
talk to their dogs,

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
they talk to their
plants, they talk

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.172 align:middle line:90%
to all kinds of other species.

00:05:53.172 --> 00:05:54.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
be otherworldly.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
We would call those
interdimensional species

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
because they're present
available to us.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.380 align:middle line:84%
But the trick is can you
listen, because talking becomes

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.090 align:middle line:90%
a form of listening.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And listening is what is missing
if you're going to communicate.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the
things I thought about

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
is like let's say the aliens
showed up on Earth, right,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:84%
in physical form, right,
three-dimensional reality,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.680 align:middle line:90%
four-dimensional reality.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.118 align:middle line:84%
It's like, who are you going
to get to talk to them?

00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get somebody
locked into the intellect,

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:90%
into this scientific mind.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:84%
They're not capable
of intuition,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and as an extension
of intuition,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:84%
telepathic receiving,
right, which

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle line:84%
is just the transfer
of information

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:90%
across an interface.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And the interface
becomes dimensional.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:90%
So there you go again.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And even dimensional
is a bad language.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:90%
It's better to--

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --think
about it as a sort

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
of like a reference point, a
contact point, an interface.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That everyone
is kind of connected to.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.733 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that's,
I think, the hub,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:84%
like you see in the
old days of the lady

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.140 align:middle line:84%
with the telephones
plugging in the cables.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think that's kind
of a good way to look at this,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.890 align:middle line:84%
is that we all
have that ability,

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.250 align:middle line:84%
we just have to know
what plug to plug

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.013 align:middle line:84%
into to get on that frequency,
I'll say, or vibration.

00:07:15.013 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You know, to be
able to communicate that way.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And
that's true, and that's

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
why I've over the
years developed up

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.190 align:middle line:84%
this theory of approximate
reality about there being

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:84%
specific points of
contact, because that's

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:84%
what we're talking about
is can I go and contact

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that point, the point of
consciousness of a tree

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.830 align:middle line:90%
or a horse, a dog.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a funny story, I
gave a lecture and a man

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.668 align:middle line:90%
owned a racehorse, right?

00:07:42.668 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And he came to me and says, can
you do anything with animals?

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, sure.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So I go to the
racehorse stables,

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and I'm walking along with him.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we got to the horse,
she's a young two-year-old,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.807 align:middle line:90%
and she was not run.

00:07:56.807 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:84%
She's too skittish, and
this, that, and the other.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:90%
She had problems.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So I stand there, and the
horse is over in the corner.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And I go, in my mind, come
over here and talk to me.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And she turns around and
comes over and puts her head

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.728 align:middle line:90%
against my chest.

00:08:11.728 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And the owner looks at me
and I go, what's wrong?

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:90%
They speak English.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the
speaking of the English,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.490 align:middle line:84%
it's being able to
communicate silently.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So silent meditation is
how Tibet, Native America,

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:84%
there's all-- and you
know, now it's very extant,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.280 align:middle line:84%
but you know, 40 years ago,
you were thought pretty crazy

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:84%
if you talked to your
animals, and let alone

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
if you want to have a
conversation with somebody

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:84%
from, you know, Sirius
or some other place

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.140 align:middle line:90%
in the star systems, right?

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And of course,
then dimensional communication

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:90%
is actually non-dimensional.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:90%
There's no distance.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:84%
There's no time,
there's no space.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that gets into
translational physics.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.888 align:middle line:90%
And so that your thoughts can--

00:09:00.888 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
if you think about
Mars, you actually

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:84%
have thoughts that you
have contact with Mars.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't think this
way, but we know

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
it happens when you think
about somebody that's a friend,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and then you have a
thought about them

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.980 align:middle line:90%
and then they call you.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the same communication
module, the same communication

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
method that would occur
with pick 100 people that

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.080 align:middle line:84%
have some sort of sensitivity
to that and put them out there.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of the scientists,
get rid of the politicians

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.375 align:middle line:84%
there and go, let's
have a conversation.

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a starting
point, and that starting point

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:90%
is neutrality.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
We're taught positive
and negative.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever teach you neutral.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what do
you think of the war,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:84%
or what do you think
of this person?

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't, meaning I don't expend
any energy in that direction,

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.280 align:middle line:90%
therefore saving it for myself.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.890 align:middle line:84%
But from that point of
neutrality, you can listen.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the keys that
I teach when I teach people,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.380 align:middle line:84%
is one of the first lessons,
you need to learn to listen.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And that listening
is not through sound,

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:84%
it is listening
through energy, it's

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:90%
listening through consciousness.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And back to the
horse, I basically

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:90%
asked the horse what was wrong.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said that she
was afraid of the dark.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So I turned to the
owner and told him, just

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.960 align:middle line:90%
leave a light on.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:84%
He left a light on, no
more afraid of the dark,

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:90%
ran races, great deal.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:84%
How do you come up with
that through science?

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:27.700 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.200 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.825 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is going to
walk up to the horse

00:10:29.825 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and go, oh, you're
afraid of the dark, huh?

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:90%
But that's communication.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And so communication can occur
at all levels with all species.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:90%
It occurs with plants.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:10%
Marcel Vogel, who I studied
way back in early '70s,

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:10%
he was involved with
"Secret Life of Plants."

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:10%
And there's a whole
bunch of species

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:10%
of plants you can communicate.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:10%
And they demonstrated
that scientifically,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.180 align:middle line:10%
but people ignore
"Secret Life of Plants"

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.030 align:middle line:10%
was actually the beginning of
electromagnetic interactions

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:10%
and conscious
interactions with plants.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:90%
And it has evolved from there.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it has fallen
out of the mainstream science

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.810 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
understand it,

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.370 align:middle line:84%
they can't calibrate
it, they can't

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:84%
find some way to
make it scientific,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.207 align:middle line:90%
because it's beyond that.

00:11:12.207 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
find about all conscious

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
universe, is it's going

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:84%
to be beyond whatever
level of science

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that wants to deal with it
in an intellectual manner,

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:84%
because the intellect is
incapable of dealing with it.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What would I say
to someone that has never

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:84%
had an ET experience their
entire lives, and all

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden something
happens and now they're

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:38.130 align:middle line:84%
like, well, what do I do,
and why did they pick me?

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: The
easiest way to look at it

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:46.750 align:middle line:84%
is we tend to frame things in
reference to known quantities.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an ET
experience, you're

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:84%
going to reframe it in the
same order of reference

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:84%
as, say, a nightmare, or
as a dream, a nice dream.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it can go to
either polarity, right?

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:84%
It's something
horrific or something

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:90%
that was very pleasant for you.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about that is
the why is somebody chosen

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:84%
or why did it happen
to me literally

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:84%
becomes what's called
an affinity bond.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Like, you already
have an openness

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:90%
to that type of knowledge.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.770 align:middle line:84%
You already have an openness
to that type of person.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Or we could equate it to
all your relationships.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, now we're in
the physical relationships,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:84%
but now let's go to mental
or emotional relationships.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's keep on going.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't I have
relationships with that

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
which we call psychic
or which we call astral

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
or which we call
interdimensional or

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.450 align:middle line:90%
intradimensional?

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:90%
We're back into all that.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Because all those
areas are populated,

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and again, there's
historical reference.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:84%
There's the way the
Native Americans

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:84%
relate to those beings
that are non-physical.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
The entire hierarchy of their
mythology, we would call it--

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:84%
it's not mythology to them,
it's a reality to them--

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and then you have people
like Castaneda referred to it

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:90%
as there's ways to access it.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's for people that
are actively seeking it out.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
on those interactions

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:90%
is you were convenient.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:90%
You were accessible.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And you know, science
doesn't like that.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:84%
They want to have some
ration and reason to

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.360 align:middle line:84%
how this and that
and this and that.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And it gets more into a
quantum potentiality, right?

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.037 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Is lineage
involved with that at all?

00:13:56.037 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: It can be.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.522 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Genetic DNA lineage.

00:13:58.522 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
Well, it would fall

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.820 align:middle line:84%
on the category of
epigenetic changes

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that occur through
traumatic acts.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.005 align:middle line:90%
So now we have that.

00:14:07.005 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:84%
That was just in
the last few years

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:84%
they come up with epigenetic
changes in the human genome.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
But then if you look at
it as conditioned space,

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:84%
now that's a whole
different deal.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But it actually
is the same deal.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So conditioned space, by your
thoughts, by your openness,

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like how many
different paths are there

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.790 align:middle line:84%
to get to the point
of an ET interaction.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, consciously you
could say I'm open to it,

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and then subconsciously you
could say I'm open to it,

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and non-consciously
I'm open to it,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually you
could say Emery did it to me.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right,
that's the other part.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.500 align:middle line:84%
That'd be a nice thing
to talk about too,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
is could there be some
negativity out there that we

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:84%
may have to interact with
or might bring back with us

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.190 align:middle line:84%
or that might be an
attachment of some sort.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: I think Harvard
University did a study probably

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:90%
six or seven years ago now.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And in the study, they found
out that, when you dream,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.290 align:middle line:90%
you take your senses with you.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So your sensory
input is non-local.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the easy way to put it.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you dream state, if
you're dreaming and I sit

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:84%
there poke on you, and it takes
a while for you to get back.

>>VEITENHEIMER:
Well, non-local would

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:84%
be, if it's non-local,
where are you?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:90%
You're not in the body, right?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You're everywhere.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.495 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
In a dream state.

00:15:31.495 --> 00:15:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And then now let's
go to daydreaming.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Then it's like I poke on you
and I go, where were you?

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And you go, well, I
was somewhere else.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I started
that proximate reality theory,

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to
know where that was.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know where that
was, where that information is,

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:84%
or where you went, and
can I get there too.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes non-local
to this reality reference,

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.550 align:middle line:90%
planet Earth.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
it doesn't have

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:84%
existence or reference in some
other portion of the spectrum.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.157 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right?

00:16:06.157 --> 00:16:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Or the continuum, whichever
language you want to use.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:90%
So there are things out there.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.900 align:middle line:84%
We take our senses
with you when we dream.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:84%
We take them when we're
non-conscious, unconscious,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.760 align:middle line:90%
hungover, right?

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.250 align:middle line:84%
All drugs states are
non-conscious states,

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:84%
meaning they're
non-conscious, non-local.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.690 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
you've not traveled out

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.450 align:middle line:84%
into the realm of pink
elephants and flying snakes

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:90%
and I'm Napoleon.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And because all those are
true for where they are.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of
the things I learned,

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I started work at the mental
hospital to pay for my way

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:90%
through school.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And we had the DT,
delirious tremors ward.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And I would go in
there, and these people

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:84%
would relate to me all
their thinking, all

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:90%
their experiences.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And after about
six months, I go,

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.850 align:middle line:84%
these people are
telling the truth.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:84%
They are telling the absolute
truth of their experience.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
There is validity
in their dreams.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:84%
There's validity in
their ET experience,

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.180 align:middle line:84%
because they experienced
it with their senses.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But when you try
to bring that back

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.845 align:middle line:84%
into this reality,
first of all, you're

00:17:15.845 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:84%
going to get disapproval,
disbelief, and dis, dis, dis

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:90%
everything else.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.720 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to someone saying,
well, let's take a look at it.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's examine where you went.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's examine what
your interactions were.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.325 align:middle line:84%
And not from a
psychiatric standpoint.

00:17:30.325 --> 00:17:31.325 align:middle line:90%
That's all talk therapy.

00:17:31.325 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't do it.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:90%
This is for one of exploration.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So now we're exploring
the universe properly.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:84%
We're exploring it
with consciousness,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and we're exploring
it with I don't even

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:84%
know what to call them, those
people that have gone before us

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that manage to get drunk or
drugged out or did something

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and found some area of knowledge
or some area of interest

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:84%
or other populations
or entities or beings,

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and were able to
interact with them.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that would
be a matter of curiosity.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
something that instead gets,

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.225 align:middle line:90%
aw, it was anecdotal.

00:18:06.225 --> 00:18:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Aw, it wasn't true.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it was true.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:84%
If you had the
experience, it is true.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that would be
a great thing for, I think,

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.570 align:middle line:84%
the world to look at as getting
a group of qualified people

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:84%
together to explore
that part of the mind

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and that part of that
consciousness before, you know,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.072 align:middle line:84%
electrocuting someone or
chopping their heads off.

00:18:29.072 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Right,
or lobotomize or--

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.492 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, like
they used to do.

00:18:32.492 --> 00:18:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --yeah.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, they
still do a form of it.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.510 align:middle line:90%
They disenfranchise you.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:90%
They call you a kook.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:84%
They use all the
language because they

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:90%
can't understand it.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.640 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.778 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: They
don't have the experience.

00:18:49.778 --> 00:18:51.090 align:middle line:90%
They can't relate to it.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.620 align:middle line:90%
And they can't repeat it.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.440 align:middle line:90%
But you know, everybody that--

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I won't name
brands, but we could

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.670 align:middle line:84%
say that everybody drinks
a certain brand of beer

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.350 align:middle line:90%
ends up in the same place.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing if they
drink a certain brand of liquor.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Won't get into, but
they're repeatable travel

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:84%
to a specific space
in the continuum.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And to me,
that can be deciphered,

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:22.320 align:middle line:84%
it can be delineated,
it can be calibrated.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
information there.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.225 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
And historically,

00:19:26.225 --> 00:19:27.975 align:middle line:84%
especially around the
turn of the century,

00:19:27.975 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:84%
we started eliminating all
that, and any reference to it

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.820 align:middle line:84%
or anybody that would
participate in it.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we did was
kind of lobotomize ourself.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:84%
We made it where
it's not possible.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we think that all
communication with anybody

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.160 align:middle line:84%
from ET to other
species has to be done

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:90%
through some electronic means.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's just not true.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.980 align:middle line:90%
People talk to their dogs.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:90%
People talk to their plants.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:90%
People talk to trees.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Trees talk to each other.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:84%
That was a recent study just
came out in the last few weeks,

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and where they're
finding communication.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:03.505 align:middle line:10%
And all they're
doing is building

00:20:03.505 --> 00:20:05.380 align:middle line:10%
on "Secret Life of Plants."

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:10%
So we look at "Secret
Life of Plants"

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.810 align:middle line:10%
and go, that was 45 years ago.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:10%
That was 50 years ago.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:10%
And we've made no advancement,
but we can say we have rockets.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: So.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Recently, there was a
posting of twin brothers that

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:84%
were-- one was an astronaut,
I think, one wasn't.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:84%
One spent so many days
in space and came back.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
They looked at their DNA,
and it was different.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
The question I would
have to ask is how

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.462 align:middle line:90%
is that happening genetically?

00:20:36.462 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: The
thing about the twins

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:84%
is every individual,
consciousness,

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:84%
spirit, whatever
you want to call it,

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:84%
is transformative once it
goes into physical form.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with twins, and
you can take identical DNA,

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
but the deviations
start occurring because

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:84%
of the presence of
the consciousness

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.780 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit that inhabits
that physical form.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:04.392 align:middle line:84%
So you have identical DNA
that's being transformed

00:21:04.392 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:84%
not from outside, like we want
to go, oh, it's environment.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And
that way, we can totally

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:84%
know the presence of
consciousness or presence

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of the soul or spirit
within the body that might

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:90%
be exerting those changes.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And the exertion is applied
through an energetic level

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
of information transfer,
epigenetic change,

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
reprogramming the DNA that goes
on all the time, the genes,

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.630 align:middle line:84%
because all they
are is templates.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Genes are just templates.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy flowing through
them that makes them expressed.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about that,
then your consciousness alone,

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts alone are
causing your body to change.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
what we find out

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:84%
when we look at illnesses,
is like what kind of person

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:90%
has that illness.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:84%
What kind of person
has come to a point

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.140 align:middle line:84%
in their own
consciousness where it's

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.702 align:middle line:90%
possible to have that illness.

00:21:54.702 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, where it's step one or
two, what kind of consciousness

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:84%
is possible or necessary for you
to extend on out to the point

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:90%
you could communicate.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.460 align:middle line:84%
All communication is
just energy slowed down.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Energy slowed down
becomes communication.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.410 align:middle line:90%
It becomes information.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we have.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.070 align:middle line:84%
We have I and E,
only it's E and I.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.800 align:middle line:84%
We have energy in the
form of slowed down

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.070 align:middle line:84%
energy becomes information,
and that's what we process.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
But at an energetic
level, we're still

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:84%
capable of processing
that information.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:90%
And we do it non-consciously.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And here we go into non-locally,
meaning within the body,

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and within the field that
surrounds us, and then

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.480 align:middle line:84%
the entire field of the
Earth and the universe,

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:84%
because one of the things
that we don't talk about

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.870 align:middle line:84%
is like what's the
energetic consciousness

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.240 align:middle line:84%
or state of consciousness of the
space we're traveling through.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER:
Now, if you think

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.580 align:middle line:84%
about that as your
house or your job

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
or where you travel up and
down the street, that's one.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But what about if
we expand it on out?

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
What kind of energetic cloud is
our planet traveling through?

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: All different
trajectories.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Yes, because
the trajectories go crazy.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.155 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: And we call
that infinite potential then.

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So you do have that
infinite potential,

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.620 align:middle line:84%
but you can't manifest it if you
don't have enough energy to it.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like buying a car.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Randy, where do you
think human communication is

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.775 align:middle line:90%
going in the future?

00:23:23.775 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VEITENHEIMER: Aha.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
I've actually thought
about that a little bit.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
about the imagination

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:84%
is that imagination plus a
little bit of energy and effort

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.660 align:middle line:90%
becomes reality.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at our
level of communication

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:84%
throughout history, it
evolved from, let's say,

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.252 align:middle line:84%
signaling, grunting, this,
that, and the other--

00:23:54.252 --> 00:23:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Smoke signals.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: --right,
into emojis, right?

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:90%
And hieroglyphics, same thing.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:84%
But what makes you think it
wouldn't become nonverbal?

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: So if
you look at it that way--

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and this ties into the book
called "Childhood's End."

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:84%
The storyline itself
evolves humanity

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.300 align:middle line:84%
to a point of constant
contact with everybody

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:90%
in the same consciousness field.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So we look at that, and
then you go see a movie,

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:90%
say like "Predator 3."

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So "Predator 3" has a child
with autistic spectrum in it.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.660 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is
"Childhood's End" actually

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:84%
has the same information,
written in 1948 or something,

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
about some sort of
level of interaction

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:90%
that didn't require the verbal.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And so if you take those
two, and "Predator 3"

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
they said that that
young man in there

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
had evolved to a higher
level of existence.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, with autistic children
that I've worked with,

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:90%
it's very interesting.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Most humans have about
30 inputs or less.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Think about it as
radio channels.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: They can tune
into about 30 different forms

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.910 align:middle line:90%
of input.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And that can range
from temperature

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.610 align:middle line:90%
to voice or visuals or whatever.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
I first noticed

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:30.430 align:middle line:84%
on a highly kinetic
autistic child I worked on

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.130 align:middle line:84%
is through working
on him found out

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:84%
he was working on
about 5,000 inputs.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, why
wouldn't you be crazy?

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.910 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't you be kinetic?

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't you be anything?

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And the ability
to shut that down

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:84%
to some normal
level, whatever that

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:84%
is, all the kinetic
activity went away,

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and actually he was able to
communicate with his mother

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and stuff, and hadn't been
for the first 12 years.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen that repeated
with other children.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.543 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Wow.

00:25:59.543 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VEITENHEIMER: So
the question becomes,

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.880 align:middle line:84%
is autism or
autistic spectrum, is

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.220 align:middle line:90%
that some form of advancement?

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a horrible thing for
the people, and particularly

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:90%
the parents.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And I have an opinion
about our inability

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.010 align:middle line:90%
to address that or fix that.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime,
it does provide

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:84%
a window that says that we
are not limited to 30 inputs.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:90%
We're not limited.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, if there's
5,000 inputs in that child,

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.340 align:middle line:90%
what are they connected to?

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.125 align:middle line:90%
And that becomes the future.

00:26:35.125 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: What a great show.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Thanks, Randy, for
coming on board.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Love talking about
this ET communication.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.620 align:middle line:84%
The people really needed to
understand how that works.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining me.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Emery Smith.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And until next
time, stay vigilant.
