00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:13.300 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.200 align:middle line:10%
>> I do believe that we all have
guides, we all have guardians,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.020 align:middle line:10%
we all have angels,
ancestors who are around you,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.940 align:middle line:10%
spirit ancestors.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's important that we
ask, that we knock on that door

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and with an expectant
faith, that door opens.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's documented in so
many different ancient cultures.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:10%
So it's important for us to just
reach out because they're there

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.710 align:middle line:10%
to help for everything.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And we need to recognize
when the intuition is there.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And when we recognize that
we're giving strength to it.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And when it's way
out of the norm,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.080 align:middle line:84%
that's when it's very, very
important for us to follow.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:84%
It's always going to lead us in
the right direction, especially

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:90%
when it doesn't make sense.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:84%
That's when, you know they
really went out on a limb

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.850 align:middle line:84%
to give you that intuition is
when it doesn't make sense,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.160 align:middle line:84%
that's the very important
times you do it.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:90%
You follow it every time.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's whole teams set
up to work with us constantly.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're always around
us if we want them there.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is when you
follow what they tell you to do,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
they get to in turn get a
stronger connection to you,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and there's so much
love coming from them.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Every relationship
requires time,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:90%
and it requires directed energy.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to put the
energy toward it.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:90%
It is the same way with God.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:90%
You have to set the time aside.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can talk to God just
like I'm talking to you.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I had this really hard day, and
I was so frustrated and angry.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:90%
And I need your help with that.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I'm going to
pull enough energy out of myself

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:90%
to make that situation better.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you do have
that conversation,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:90%
don't do all the talking.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.125 align:middle line:90%
Sit and quietly listen.

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:84%
For a while you won't hear
anything but your own thoughts

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.760 align:middle line:90%
popping up.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, the more
you get to know God,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and the more you
get used to sharing,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to identify
what is your internal voice

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.020 align:middle line:90%
and what is God speaking to you.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I've just learned over the
years that if I sort of talk

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
things over and pray before,
it makes things go better.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my life
repeatedly, I've charged

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:84%
into something and
without thinking it over,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and then I found
in over my head.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is terrible.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] But I
found over the years,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:84%
if I just pray about it at
first, God guide me in this,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and lead me in this,
it works out easier.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't do what people--

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't do the get
on my knees and sit.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:90%
No, I talk to him.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Please help that
person who passed away

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
to transfer easily into
your realm up there.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I have a feeling like he's
right here all the time.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel that
there's ever any distance.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
That was clear when I was out
of my body, up on the ceiling,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:90%
and throughout my whole life.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
intervening in that situation.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I so appreciate you
being in my life.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm here because I'm your
hands and your heart here.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you put people in
front of me that need help,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm always going to do
whatever I can to assist.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So keep me here as long
as you want me here.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you want me to come
home, I'm ready to come home.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I call it not heaven and
hell, because I don't believe

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:90%
in the judgment part of that.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.905 align:middle line:90%
I call it home, returning home.

00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no escape
hatch in heaven.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no fast track
to get into heaven.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And suicide is not a route
where you can go and just hurry

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:90%
and get into heaven.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The lessons that you were
supposed to learn here,

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
you're still going to have
to learn those lessons.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:90%
So there's no circumventing it.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:84%
There's no hijacking
God's system and saying,

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting into heaven today.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:84%
It's just it's not
going to happen.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.883 align:middle line:90%
>> I can understand that.

00:04:04.883 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Kind of have to work hard to
stay all the way in your body

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:90%
after you've been out.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.200 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to stay out and
be oblivious to the world.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So it is work actually because
it's more pleasant to stay out.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:90%
The thing is it's not an escape.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So just like I had
to do, whatever

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.050 align:middle line:84%
darkness that you're
struggling with on this side,

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.883 align:middle line:84%
you have to work through
when you get there.

00:04:24.883 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not-- for me anyway--

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just immediately into
a bright white light and all

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like that at all.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I had to sort out
that darkness in me.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And I struggled with
depression, social anxiety.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And at least here in the States,
there's so much hopelessness.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:84%
People feel like it's
just getting worse,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's never
going to get better.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.208 align:middle line:90%
And you have to have purpose.

00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have purpose,
you're going to be hopeless.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And so someone
asked me, well, how

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
do you figure out
what your purpose is?

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And I told them, I said, I
think the big misconception is

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.680 align:middle line:90%
that it's one thing.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Your purpose is what's
in front of you that day.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
If you notice you've got
an 80-year-old neighbor

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.370 align:middle line:84%
who's struggling to drag her
trash can to the curb and back

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:90%
every week, that's your purpose.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Go out there and
help her with that.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.467 align:middle line:10%
And you'll find,
the less focused

00:05:16.467 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:10%
you are on your own
misery and the more

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:10%
you're looking for those
little opportunities,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.350 align:middle line:10%
the better you'll start
feeling about yourself

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:10%
because you're putting
good into the equation.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
You're putting good
out into the world.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But those acts of kindness,
those spontaneous ideas of ways

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
you can help or
improve things, we

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.850 align:middle line:84%
tend to just internalize those,
and we don't ever act on them.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you-- just one
time-- just one time a week,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:90%
act on it.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And you will see your
whole world open up

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:84%
because you are then responding
to the urging of God.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And once you start
doing that, you'll

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:90%
start hearing him more clearly.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the
easiest ways to start

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
getting that communication going
two way and not just one way.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Listen to the patients
who have had a near-death

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:84%
They say, I was sent back
because I had a task to fulfill,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:84%
because I have something
to do in this world.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddhists
say that suffering

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:90%
belongs to life as well.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not about the suffering.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the trauma
but how you handle it.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.110 align:middle line:84%
That's how you handle
the suffering, how

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
you handle this trauma,
that's the important thing.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>> It is challenging.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't deny that.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But I will also point out I
recognized after my journey

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that the hardships and
difficulties in life are gifts.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:84%
They are what nudge us towards
a deeper understanding.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:84%
They are here for our
learning and teaching.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:84%
The hardships in my own life,
for example, being put up

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
for adoption when
I was 11 days old,

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I think that challenge
was a gift to me.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
It came with a gift
of understanding.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And so likewise, the hardships
and hurdles in our current world

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.090 align:middle line:90%
are there as a gift.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:84%
But to those who would think
oh, that beautiful afterlife

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:90%
sounds so wonderful.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.770 align:middle line:84%
This life is so miserable, I'm
going to go on and kill myself,

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.510 align:middle line:90%
that's the wrong move.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Suicide and homicide should
never be anything you do.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, any actions
we take in this world

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:84%
should be guided
by the golden rule.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Because if there's one thing
that the life review teaches us,

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
it's that the golden
rule in many ways

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:84%
is written into the
fabric of the universe.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:84%
The life review is one
where you relive the events.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a
remembering of events.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, you relive it
from the perspective of everyone

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.890 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you've been busy
handing out pain and suffering

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:84%
to others, in your
life review, you'll

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:90%
be on the receiving end of that.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
And that may not be pretty.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think that's
where our notions of hell

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:90%
have come from.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.275 align:middle line:84%
People who are so
busy hurting others

00:07:49.275 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:84%
that when they went
through their life review

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and had to feel that,
it was very unpleasant,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and they did not like
it one little bit.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's
important for all of us

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:84%
in living these lives to
take the lessons of NDEs

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and to treat others with
kindness, compassion, mercy,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:84%
acceptance, when
necessary, forgiveness.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel that we originate
at home on the other side.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.060 align:middle line:84%
We come here to have
experiences to grow our soul.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And those experiences can be
both positive and negative.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like
we can just say,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:84%
oh, we're just here for
this really happy life,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and everything's
going to be fine.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has challenges.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has
struggles, everyone.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:84%
But how we deal with
those experiences also

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:42.110 align:middle line:84%
helps us to learn how
to be stronger and grow

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:84%
our soul in ways of
accomplishing success in getting

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.040 align:middle line:90%
through those situations.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
all have a purpose

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.040 align:middle line:84%
that we all are coming
down here to do.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking about
leaving that, you should focus

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:84%
instead on when you're going to
be here, as long as you're here,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
how can you make other
people and yourself

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.375 align:middle line:84%
happy by doing good
things in the world?

00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to be the people.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:90%
You could be out planting trees.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:84%
You could be out doing something
for the world, for nature.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Anything that motivates you to
do something beautiful to help,

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.060 align:middle line:84%
then that's what
you're here for.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:90%
That's your purpose.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.510 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean you're perfect.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
It just means that you're trying
really hard to do good stuff

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:90%
and focus on that.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>> When you have a little
one and they start walking,

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:84%
they take a tentative
step and they fall.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:90%
And they get up.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they cry or they
whack their head or whatever.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:84%
But you don't think
less of them for that.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
You understand that
developmentally they're

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:84%
at a point where they don't
have the perfect coordination

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:90%
to execute walking.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And so you pick them
up over and over again.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:90%
You're all right.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:90%
No blood.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I used to tell my
kids, no blood.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's try again.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:90%
You're OK.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And you stand a little closer
until they get more confident.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly
who you are to God.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
creator of the universe.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:90%
We are all just toddlers to him.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So remind yourself that
you have this loving

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.740 align:middle line:90%
God that's like it's OK.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Let me help.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Let me pick you back up.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's start again.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Your spirit thinks a lot more of
your capabilities than you do.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when you come into
trouble, just remember,

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:84%
this was an experience
that my spirit knew

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.100 align:middle line:90%
I needed to have to grow me.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>> There is meaning to even
our mistakes in this life.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's important for us
to succeed and to fail

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:90%
but to always be learning.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we grow.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.280 align:middle line:84%
That's how we raise
our frequency.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:84%
That's how we embody the
creator in ourselves.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:90%
And that brings us to love.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Love is the amplifier
of success here.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.620 align:middle line:84%
So as we love and
care for others,

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:84%
we in turn are loving
and caring for ourselves.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we feel that we are
lacking anything in this life,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:84%
if we go outside ourselves
to give the world,

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:84%
give others in the world
that that we are lacking,

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:84%
we in turn will literally
receive exactly what we need.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.950 align:middle line:84%
As we give to the world,
as we give to the universe,

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:90%
we receive.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And the same principle
goes when we criticize,

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and when we point out
imperfections and weaknesses

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.370 align:middle line:90%
in others.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important for us to
use this virtual reality because

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:90%
to me that's what this is.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.360 align:middle line:90%
This is the pit stop.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:90%
We are not this.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:90%
We are eternal spiritual beings.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're here on a short
pit stop in a classroom.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important
for us to understand

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:90%
the rules of the game.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
rules of the game,

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
that if you put out
good, you get good.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.030 align:middle line:90%
If you put out bad, you get bad.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And where we can begin
our energy of flowing out

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.850 align:middle line:90%
is we begin with our thoughts.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And as we master the
power of flowing,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:84%
we become like the
flow-er or the flower

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:18.320 align:middle line:84%
where we're bringing energy in
and letting it flow through.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>> People often ask me, Raymond,
do you believe that God exists?

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And what I say is yes, I
have a relationship with God.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's not anything
that came from religion.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just that over the
years, hearing these people

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
talk about their experiences,
it kind of rubbed off onto me.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:90%
I have a sense of this presence.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Then in 1991, I was
very distressed.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible things going on.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And I had a personal experience
of the presence of God.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like all the
great, the mystics.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there aren't any words.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
It was the most real
experience I ever had.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I have a relationship
with God, but I'm not religious.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
God has never said anything
to me about religion.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people with
near-death experiences say.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the personal
experience you have of divinity.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Near-death experiences
for thousands of years,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:84%
no matter what their
prior belief system,

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
have been coming
back to this world

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:28.270 align:middle line:84%
after their experience talking
about the binding force of love.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:84%
They were welcomed there
by loved ones who had left

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:90%
the physical plane already.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And, ultimately, having
had that experience,

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you it's
very comforting.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:90%
That is like a spiritual home.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So near-death experiencers
come back less religious

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:90%
but more spiritual.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, religion can be a beautiful
way of getting to spirituality.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:10%
To the extent that
any religion, allows

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:10%
us to foster much more of a
sense of all-inclusive love,

00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:10%
unconditional love for others,
kindness, compassion, and mercy,

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.150 align:middle line:10%
then that religion is
still doing some good

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:10%
to enhance spirituality.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.490 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
religious ideology

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.530 align:middle line:84%
for the last few
thousand years has

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:84%
been hijacked by people
who tend to ignore

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:84%
the original message of the
prophets and use religion

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:90%
to control other people.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:10%
>> All these religions teach
us that we need to go driving

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:10%
around and seeking God outside
ourselves in these temples

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:10%
and these churches and
these special holy places.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:90%
And yes, those are holy places.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Those are places you
can connect to God.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But you can connect to God
at every moment of your life.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:90%
God exists within.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.465 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
need to honor the most.

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:84%
That's where we need
to clean the most.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.673 align:middle line:84%
That's where we need
to work the most.

00:14:46.673 --> 00:14:49.850 align:middle line:84%
That's where we need to
actively plan and use

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts to program our
own life in a positive nature.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And one way that I
was taught to do that

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:90%
is to honor your hour of power.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And the hour of power
is the first 30 minutes

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:84%
when you wake up and the last
30 minutes before you go to bed.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And what you're putting
in your hour of power,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
that is what you are
truly worshiping.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're putting news there,
if you're putting sports there,

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
if you're putting
social media there,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.050 align:middle line:84%
if you're putting
business there,

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.920 align:middle line:90%
then that is your religion.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
religion you say you are,

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:90%
that is your religion.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And that the only way for us
to be cognizant and connected

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:84%
to the creator is to
create a sacred space

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:90%
in your hour of power.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:90%
Connect to the creator.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.290 align:middle line:90%
You can do that through prayer.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:84%
You can do that
through meditation.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.437 align:middle line:84%
You can do that through
scripture study.

00:15:42.437 --> 00:15:45.700 align:middle line:84%
You can do that through
studying holy writings.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:84%
You can even do that through
watching motivational YouTubes.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.490 align:middle line:84%
You can really do a beautiful
thing with your life

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
by making sure that you
are programming what

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:90%
goes in your hour of power--

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.560 align:middle line:90%
not life, you.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you put you
in charge of you,

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:84%
you get to direct
where your life goes.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the best exercises
that you can do is to write

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:90%
your own eulogy.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know it sounds dark, but
when you write your eulogy,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:84%
you're writing what you want
people to say about your life

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:90%
after you're gone.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you
such great direction.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.687 align:middle line:84%
If I could live a
life where people

00:16:25.687 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:84%
would tell that story
about me, then I

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:84%
feel like I'll have done
what I'm supposed to do here.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So how do you live
a life that results

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.820 align:middle line:90%
in a testimony like that?

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And it is through purpose,
through getting up every day,

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:84%
leaving your house,
interacting with people.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:90%
We were built for relationship.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Who you are is somebody
who is interconnected

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:90%
with everyone else around you.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And you have to remember
that when you are carrying on

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:50.760 align:middle line:90%
with your life.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> That is something that I
think is absolutely critical

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
for us to understand, that
the cold and bleak story

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.597 align:middle line:84%
of materialism that pretends
we don't even have free will

00:17:02.597 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and that we're completely
separate beings and that

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.650 align:middle line:84%
we're only material and these
little ego selves, turns out,

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:84%
none of that is true and that
we're much more interconnected.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>> One major important change
that happened in me is after

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.589 align:middle line:84%
my experience, I realized that
a lot of people around me that I

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.599 align:middle line:84%
called friends were not
actually my friends.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
They weren't there to support
or lift me up in any way.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:84%
They were there essentially to
ride on whatever ride I was on.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And right away, I
started cleaning that up.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:84%
I started being very
choosy about who I was

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.590 align:middle line:90%
going to spend my time with.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And I made sure that it was
with only positive people

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and with those who
wanted to build me up,

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to build them up,
in a very synchronistic manner.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
even within myself

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:84%
that there was this new
struggle that I was never

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:90%
aware of before.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:84%
A lot of ancient Native
American cultures

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.600 align:middle line:84%
talk about the tale of the
white wolf and the black wolf.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:10%
The white wolf is your
spirit, your soul.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
The black wolf is the
physical manifestation of you,

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.210 align:middle line:84%
your physical self,
your ego self.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And the ego represents
edging God out.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:10%
It's making sure you're
safe and away from anything

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:10%
that could harm the body.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:90%
And then there's the mind.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.720 align:middle line:84%
The mind is the
caretaker of the two.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So the mind is the one that
gets to choose who I feed today.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And every day, I try to
always feed both wolves

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want to
constantly only feed the higher

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:84%
You're going to end up
neglecting the body.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, you don't
want to always feed the ego.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.290 align:middle line:84%
You're going to end up
without any conscience

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and without any
inspired intuition.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So you keep a
stronger white wolf,

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.860 align:middle line:84%
but keep the black wolf fed
then you're going to be OK.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:84%
With that balance is
where we can really

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.500 align:middle line:84%
master ourselves and
really master our own lives

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:90%
and master our own successes.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, the whole purpose of
meditation is to put the ego

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.640 align:middle line:84%
voice into timeout, because I
love how Michael Singer in his

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.742 align:middle line:84%
book "The Untethered Soul," he
says, that voice in your head.

00:19:17.742 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And many people identify
with that voice.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:84%
They think that's
their consciousness.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:84%
The voice in the head is
your annoying roommate,

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:84%
which means that is
not who you truly are.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Your higher soul, which
is much more involved

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:84%
with the higher
good-- the higher soul

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:84%
is what you come in touch with
in a near-death or a shared

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:90%
death experience.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And that higher soul
is in the process

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:84%
of growing, learning, and
teaching with other higher

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:90%
souls.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And the more one
gets into meditation,

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:84%
centering prayer
and doing good work

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
to help change the
world for the better,

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
the more they start to realize
they're not that little ego

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:84%
self at all, but something
far grander than that.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>> But we tend to get a
little cocky in this world,

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:84%
especially once we achieve the
littlest amounts of success.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:84%
We tend to start believing
that we are almost a god.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's really funny
how quick we can

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.280 align:middle line:90%
be put in a place of humility.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Even when we're at
the top of our world,

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.490 align:middle line:84%
we're at the top of our
financial ladder or career

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
ladder or family ladder, we feel
like we're at the top of life,

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.450 align:middle line:90%
how quickly we can be humbled.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
It's important
that we make plans.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.420 align:middle line:90%
We make goals.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:90%
We make objectives.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:84%
But God does know the
real path of all of this.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, our
plans never work out the way

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that we wanted them
to, but they work out

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:90%
the way they were meant to.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, it feels like God
knew us before he plunked us

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:90%
into a body.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.640 align:middle line:84%
He did have intention
for us coming in,

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.080 align:middle line:84%
but I think the intention is
far broader than people realize.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:84%
The intention is that you would
remember where you came from,

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.050 align:middle line:90%
that you came from God.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I think that life is story.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:10%
You live life forward
as the protagonist.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And then you die.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And you see everything you've
ever done in a timeless state,

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:84%
but from the point of view of
the other characters involved.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And then as I
personally gather, you

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.700 align:middle line:84%
go through some
incomprehensible experience,

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and then that you're back
on another storyline.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Then you want to know if you are
a number of different stories,

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.960 align:middle line:84%
then what is that that holds
all those stories together?

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Time is a construct made by
humans in the physical world.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:90%
In essence, there is no time.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.380 align:middle line:84%
When you look back
at your life, things

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:84%
can happen like yesterday, but
that happened 20 years ago.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:84%
But because also in your
memories, there is no time.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:84%
When you're a little bit older
like me and you look back,

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:84%
everything is there
at the same time.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So time does not
exist in reality.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Everything is only now.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:90%
What you experience is now.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And what we see around us is
depending of our perception.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And what you see as red, I don't
know if you see the same red.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:90%
So it's all subjective.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:90%
We create what we perceive.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.820 align:middle line:84%
This thing that we're
in is suspicious to me.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:84%
I really think that the world
is obviously not, in reality,

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:90%
how we perceive it.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And it struck me
very early in life

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that it's so easy to imagine
that this whole framework we're

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:90%
in is illusory.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:90%
I've never been a physicalist.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Some people draw from
the fact that things

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:84%
persist in the
world, that therefore

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.010 align:middle line:84%
that there's an independent
physical reality.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't buy it.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not
saying it's not true,

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.910 align:middle line:84%
but there's no way to prove
for sure that we're not

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.640 align:middle line:90%
in a simulation or a cave.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.040 align:middle line:10%
And I've grown up.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the way I think
about the world anyway.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to imagine that it's
all an illusion in some sense.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The nature of reality is
something that we're all trying

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Science is deeply invested
in trying to explain

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.350 align:middle line:90%
this thing we call reality.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.200 align:middle line:10%
And it's ultimately critical,
because for example,

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.990 align:middle line:10%
to understand quantum
physics, the deep mystery,

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:10%
the measurement paradox
of entanglement--

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:10%
The Nobel Prize was given
for entanglement in 2022,

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:10%
which means the scientific
community is finally

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:10%
at a point where they'll admit
that four dimensional space

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:10%
time in our general notions
of physicalism and materialism

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.210 align:middle line:10%
are insufficient to explain the
nature of scientific reality.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And so for understanding
quantum physics,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
the deepest lesson here is
that mind is primordial.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's something so
high beyond our comprehension,

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
which is the fundamental
of our universe.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So for me, consciousness
is fundamental.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Everything comes from
consciousness in the universe.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Matter is condensed energy
and condensed information.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And matter is a product
of consciousness as well.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:10%
>> I love the quote
from Werner Heisenberg.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:84%
He said, the first gulp from
the glass of natural sciences

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.210 align:middle line:90%
will lead you towards atheism.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.210 align:middle line:84%
But at the bottom of the
glass, God is waiting for you.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And that simply reflects
what more than 90%

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experiencers
will tell you.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
They've had an experience
that showed them

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:84%
the reality of a loving force
at the core of the universe,

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:84%
at the core of our very
conscious awareness.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the gifts they showed
me is they allowed me to see

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:84%
into our future what our future
looks like as humanity on this

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And they showed me
a great transition,

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.950 align:middle line:84%
a great separation between
our old self and our new self.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.550 align:middle line:10%
And our new self is this
awakening the light of God

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.480 align:middle line:10%
activating inside of you.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And now that's starting
to direct you with things.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:04.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the awakening.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.793 align:middle line:84%
And this awakening is
happening across the planet.

00:25:07.793 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the kids that
are coming in the world

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.520 align:middle line:90%
now are part of that awakening.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And what that
awakening is doing is

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.570 align:middle line:84%
it's shifting away
from the old self.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we're at the
beginning of the separation.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see the
separation happen greater

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:90%
and greater and greater.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And in the process,
it's going to be weird.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And I don't fully
understand how it happens,

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:84%
but there'll be great
transitions of souls.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's mostly going
to be in the group

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:84%
of the old life, the old
mentality, the old frequency.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And then there's going to
be some of us transitioning

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
work on the good side,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.750 align:middle line:84%
on the lighter side,
on the awakened side.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So there is going to be
some transitions coming up

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of the world,
but it's not a scary thing.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not a bad thing, because
the world is not a scary place.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.920 align:middle line:90%
Every day, the sun rises.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Every day, there's good things
happening on this planet,

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for us
to bring our focus there,

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:84%
bring our embodiment
there, to the light

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and to the positive
things happening.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And as we don't
allow the world in,

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.560 align:middle line:84%
we don't allow the negative
in, we allow our own awakening.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And then the guidance
starts happening.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's going
to work either way.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:84%
If this thing just keeps
getting worse and worse

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and it collapses, the
people who are left

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
are going to know
your character,

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to look to you
to help guide that rebuilding.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't collapse and
we're able to turn it around,

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.240 align:middle line:84%
then we have to realize
that you're here

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.920 align:middle line:84%
on purpose, for a purpose,
for such a time as this.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.488 align:middle line:90%
You're not here by accident.

00:26:43.488 --> 00:26:45.030 align:middle line:84%
You're here because
there's something

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.410 align:middle line:90%
you're supposed to be doing.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's generally small.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.680 align:middle line:84%
It's generally within
your community,

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.250 align:middle line:90%
within your own household.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be functioning
in a productive way,

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.840 align:middle line:84%
not sitting around waiting
for the end to come.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>> There is purpose for good.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.080 align:middle line:90%
There's purpose for evil.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of evil is
to keep us from growing,

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:90%
to restrain us from growing.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose for good is
to empower us through growing,

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.620 align:middle line:90%
to enlighten us through growing.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And technology can
help us or hinder us.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:90%
It depends on how we use it.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I see all of the lies
swirling around that powers that

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.080 align:middle line:84%
be want us to believe
about each other.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to stand
up on a mountain and say,

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.950 align:middle line:90%
these are lies.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:90%
These are lies.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's self-perpetuating.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.940 align:middle line:84%
People seem to be sectioning
themselves off more and more,

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and that is the darkness that
is designed to keep us fighting.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.950 align:middle line:84%
But just having
those conversations

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:49.280 align:middle line:84%
helps us understand each other
and be able to move forward

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and make some
progress, and avoiding

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.110 align:middle line:84%
topics that are very
divisive with people

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.040 align:middle line:90%
that tend to like to argue.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.567 align:middle line:84%
You have to make your
life interesting enough

00:27:58.567 --> 00:28:00.650 align:middle line:84%
so it's not the only thing
you have to talk about,

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:02.330 align:middle line:84%
is what's going on
in the news cycle,

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.810 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise, that
never-ending news cycle

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:90%
is going to steamroll you.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And in terms of power and
money or things like that,

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.210 align:middle line:84%
it's difficult. I
mean, number one,

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I just can't imagine why anybody
would be so deluded as to think

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.680 align:middle line:90%
that power is important.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.850 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing about money.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like, money is a
very strange invention,

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and I've never had any
sort of sense of it.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And I hate myself
for this in a way,

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.220 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't
think about money, then

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.910 align:middle line:90%
you're always short of money.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:39.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just wish a ton of
it would come out of somewhere,

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.710 align:middle line:90%
but it wouldn't make me happy.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It would give me more
time for my work.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would say that
the reason this awakening is

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.400 align:middle line:84%
happening is to rescue the
world from the madness that is

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
so obvious in the political
polarization, all the fighting,

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:90%
the violence, the warfare.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Every bit of that is kind of
a reaction of fundamentalists

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.350 align:middle line:84%
who realize they are threatened
because this awakening is

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:90%
all about the commonality.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.510 align:middle line:90%
That we're in this together.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.520 align:middle line:84%
We're here to take
care of each other.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, the awakening
I've been talking about--

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and when I discuss meditation
on a regular basis,

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.890 align:middle line:84%
meditating every
day, I'm talking

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:84%
about using that kind
of tool to change

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.550 align:middle line:90%
this world for the better.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:84%
This is not just about
meditating and thinking

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:90%
peaceful, loving thoughts.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:32.920 align:middle line:84%
It's about living the life
in this daily activity that

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:84%
helps to take the world
to a much better place

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:84%
based on what we learn from
these notions of oneness.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:84%
That we're really here to take
care of the least, the last,

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.480 align:middle line:90%
the lost.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.290 align:middle line:84%
We really need to take
better charge of this planet,

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the
awakening is all about.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.600 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is that
any individual can use

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:90%
centering, prayer, meditation.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.100 align:middle line:84%
These are modes of going within,
connecting with that higher

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.010 align:middle line:84%
soul, with that primordial
mind, with that sense of love

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:84%
and peace and compassion
for our fellow beings.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we bring it into our
world in our daily activities.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.190 align:middle line:90%
But also taking the action.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:84%
It's putting idealism
and mind over matter

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:17.600 align:middle line:84%
to work to heal this
fractured, damaged world.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe strongly that we are
growing the spiritual connection

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.000 align:middle line:90%
worldwide.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I really feel that
it's getting stronger.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.040 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with people
understanding the bigger

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.070 align:middle line:84%
picture of near-death
experiences,

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.530 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences,
shared-death experiences.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that doctors
are accepting the information

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:46.290 align:middle line:84%
a lot more readily now
than they did 20 years ago.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's not something that
is being hidden anymore.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And in 2011, I started the
IANDS group in Santa Barbara.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.550 align:middle line:84%
There are local groups all over
the United States and Europe.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And so we have near-death
experiencers who come and talk

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:05.280 align:middle line:84%
about their stories, and we
open up the conversation.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
most important thing

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.490 align:middle line:84%
that we could be doing with
this experience that happens.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm very positive.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I've given many lectures from
university for medical students,

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.390 align:middle line:90%
psychology students.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And I see the younger
generation is open.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Also for nurses.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:10%
I've been lecturing nurses
for hospices, palliative care,

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.100 align:middle line:10%
and they're much more open.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I love that quote
from Nikola Tesla,

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:35.170 align:middle line:84%
one of the most brilliant
inventors in our history.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.560 align:middle line:84%
When he passed from this world,
I think, it was in the 1940s.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.080 align:middle line:84%
But he had said soon before
that when science first

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.380 align:middle line:84%
begins to investigate
nonphysical phenomena,

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.960 align:middle line:84%
they will discover more
in the first decade

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.580 align:middle line:84%
than in the entire
history of science.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we are
actually entering

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:84%
that decade around this time
because the scientific community

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.870 align:middle line:84%
is making gigantic leaps
in coming to a deeper

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.090 align:middle line:90%
understanding of this.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And so this revolution of
understanding coming out

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:11.430 align:middle line:84%
of the science of consciousness
unifies religion, science,

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:14.280 align:middle line:84%
spirituality in a way that we
can make sense of the world

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.290 align:middle line:90%
with one worldview.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:20.340 align:middle line:84%
This panentheism notion
that we're all in this

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.500 align:middle line:84%
together, that there
is an evolution to it,

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.110 align:middle line:84%
that we have free will,
that we contribute

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:84%
basically to the evolution
of consciousness itself.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>> We are a divine masterwork.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:36.570 align:middle line:90%
We are the divine masterwork.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:40.230 align:middle line:84%
We are eternal
spiritual beings having

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:43.980 align:middle line:84%
this little physical experience,
this little mortal experience,

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:90%
just to learn--

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:48.840 align:middle line:84%
again, in a classroom,
not a courtroom-- so

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.420 align:middle line:90%
that we can grow and get better.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.900 align:middle line:90%
We are the test.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.100 align:middle line:90%
We are the gathering.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.640 align:middle line:84%
We are the gathering of all
the DNA from all the cosmos.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.590 align:middle line:90%
And we're put in one here.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we are built
in the image of our creator.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The essence of who we
are is our consciousness.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:84%
People sometimes
compare it with when

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.050 align:middle line:84%
you look through a film,
a projection, what you see

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.230 align:middle line:90%
on the screen is just images.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the same as your
thoughts, but you

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.830 align:middle line:84%
don't project the screen,
you just see the light.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's something behind all
your thoughts and your feelings,

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's your consciousness,
which is eternal.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that we are
consciousness in the process

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.580 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.410 align:middle line:84%
It's this beautiful
dance of sentient beings

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
who are sharing that one
mind, but each manifesting

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:90%
is a different perspective.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I like to look at us as facets
on the edge of a diamond.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.650 align:middle line:84%
The diamond is the one
mind, that God mind.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet the facets are
each and every one of us

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.580 align:middle line:90%
as an individual perspective.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's how those facets
interact with each other

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that we can help that one mind
in its process of evolution.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So just as the entrance to the
temple at the Oracle of Delphi,

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.770 align:middle line:84%
there's an inscription
that says, know thyself.

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:11.989 align:middle line:84%
Well, in fact, I think that's
exactly what the challenge is,

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:13.139 align:middle line:90%
to know thyself.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:84%
But as you come to recognize,
as the modern science

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.409 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness is
pointing out to us,

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:21.139 align:middle line:84%
that we're really part of
the mind of the universe.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:24.080 align:middle line:84%
That is what is
doing the evolving.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's nothing more than
individual sentient beings

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.840 align:middle line:84%
going through this process
of learning who they are,

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.350 align:middle line:84%
why they're here, and
where this is all going.

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>> God plants us down here.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.920 align:middle line:90%
We choose to come down.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.090 align:middle line:90%
We want to grow.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:40.929 align:middle line:90%
We want to expand.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:42.960 align:middle line:90%
We want to experience.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.969 align:middle line:84%
Maybe when we get
far enough grown,

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
we get to stay home and not
have to come down anymore.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.909 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
bigger picture, but I'm

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:53.610 align:middle line:84%
glad that I strongly believe
that there is a God that's

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.230 align:middle line:90%
controlling the whole thing.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.990 align:middle line:90%
And I trust him.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>> So this was the message.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:03.060 align:middle line:84%
God said, such folly to
think anything escapes

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.290 align:middle line:84%
my knowing, as when you
were with me all at once all

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.540 align:middle line:84%
that I allowed you
to know, you knew.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.490 align:middle line:10%
No words were spoken,
nor were they shouted.

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:15.090 align:middle line:10%
I whispered them to your spirit.

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.440 align:middle line:84%
I discreetly filled
you with knowing.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Knowing flowed into you as
effortlessly as taking a breath.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Is it not so?

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.730 align:middle line:84%
No truer words have ever
been spoken or written.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.230 align:middle line:90%
The great I am is in your core.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:31.510 align:middle line:90%
The great I am is the light.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Even when I am
hidden, still, I am.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:39.370 align:middle line:84%
As my energy charged sending me
over each synapse in your brain,

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.630 align:middle line:84%
even those small
fibers knew that I am.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.050 align:middle line:84%
They rose and fell to
the rhythm I created,

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:49.590 align:middle line:84%
to the symphony I
composed, I conducted.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I consider it a tragic
comedy of arrogance

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.950 align:middle line:84%
when man denies what the
smallest innovation knows.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Man thinks he acts and
moves outside my knowledge.

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.380 align:middle line:90%
How could it be so?

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.230 align:middle line:90%
I say, I proclaim he does not.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:08.430 align:middle line:84%
His own fibers clutch
themselves laughing at the idea.

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:12.960 align:middle line:84%
I am the flower, the wind, the
rain, the sinew, the marrow,

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.700 align:middle line:84%
the rock, the author, the maker,
the touch that set in motion

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.332 align:middle line:84%
all that you see,
all that you know,

00:36:20.332 --> 00:36:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and all that you
do not see or know.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:90%
I knit you.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.110 align:middle line:90%
I put breath in you.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I am coded in every cell.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Each nanosecond of time falls
in step as I will it so.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:34.740 align:middle line:90%
I am in you.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.030 align:middle line:90%
I am all.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Even when you perceive
nothing, still, I am there.

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.990 align:middle line:84%
As I tell you this here
and now, pressing my truth

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:46.320 align:middle line:84%
into your breast, your very
heart presses it further in.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]
