00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.079 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Raymond Moody.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.760 align:middle line:84%
I got a PhD in philosophy from
the University of Virginia.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Then I went to medical school
and became a psychiatrist.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was 18 years
old when I found out

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:90%
about near-death experiences.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, it was just
a fascinating concept to me.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I never had any thoughts
about life after death,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:84%
but I was astonished
that every place I ever

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:84%
went there were almost the
same things like, Dr. Moody,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I've never told
anybody this, but--

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and I quickly realized that it
was a very common phenomenon.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And it inspired me in the
career that I had subsequently

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:84%
of being able to interview
literally thousands of people

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world
who had these experiences.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And so my first book, which
was published in 1975,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:84%
was entitled Life
After Life, but I just

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:84%
had no idea that it was going to
create the worldwide sensation

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:90%
it did.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:84%
What I think
happened, by the way,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.860 align:middle line:84%
was by the 1960s and '70s, when
I was starting to investigate

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:84%
this, by that time, due to
the advent of cardiopulmonary

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:84%
resuscitation, it was just so
common for people to be brought

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
back, whereas for eons before
then, it was a very rare event.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Eben Alexander, MD, and
I had a profound near-death

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:90%
experience back in 2008.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Before that time, I was
a conventionally trained

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:90%
neurosurgeon of the modern era.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And my academic career, I
trained at Duke Medical Center.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:10%
And then was up at Harvard
Medical School, where

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:10%
I taught for more than 15
years, which means I basically

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:10%
had been trained fully in
materialism or physicalism,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:10%
the notion that only the
physical world exists,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:10%
and that if we understand
all the laws governing

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:10%
the workings of that world,
we understand all of reality.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And then in November 2008,
I had a profound experience

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:84%
that showed me that that
model was flat out incorrect

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and that there's
much more going on

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:84%
to this mind-brain
relationship than I ever

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:90%
would have surmised before.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
probably the greatest

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:84%
gift of my near-death
experience,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.780 align:middle line:84%
was finding a world that I
completely did not expect,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and yet it seemed
like a spiritual home.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, it was far
more real than this world.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I did not anticipate
that in any way,

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.150 align:middle line:84%
and yet that's
what I experienced.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And especially given the
medical parameters of my case,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:84%
you realize that
brain of mine was

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
in no shape to have any kind
of dream or hallucination.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
My medical condition was such
that I went from having severe

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
headache and back pain in about
4:30 in the morning into grand

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.117 align:middle line:84%
mal seizures and deep
coma within three hours.

00:03:10.117 --> 00:03:12.575 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that point that
my family was very concerned,

00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:84%
they called the
EMTs to come get me.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:90%
I remember none of that.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I was gone from this
world by that point,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
taken to the emergency room
at Lynchburg General Hospital.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And I spent the next seven
days there deep in coma.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And the coma was
caused by meningitis.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:10%
And the neurologic exams,
my Glasgow Coma Scale,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:10%
my lab values, MR and
CT, every bit of that

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.790 align:middle line:10%
showed that my brain was far too
incapacitated by this illness

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:10%
and had no way of producing
any dream or hallucination.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it was an
extraordinary journey

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:90%
to go through.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for the first months
after awakening from coma,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:84%
it was a tremendous
challenge just trying

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
to explain how
this had happened.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
But the more I discovered
about how ill I was,

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
the more I realized that this
was really impossible to explain

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
with our western medical
interpretation of things

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:90%
and materialism.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is what shocked
me into realizing

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that it seemed way too real
to be real because it really

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.170 align:middle line:84%
happened, but not in
the physical world,

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
but in a much deeper, richer
place where I was interconnected

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:84%
with all elements
of my soul journey,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:84%
including a birth sister who had
already left the physical plane.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
mystery to this thing

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
we call brain-mind consciousness
and their relationship.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
beginning to discover

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:90%
how profound that mystery was.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Pim Van Lommel.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm a cardiologist
from the Netherlands.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I started to study
near-death experiences

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:90%
many, many years ago in 1986.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.880 align:middle line:10%
I read a book by George
Ritchie, "Return from Tomorrow,"

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:10%
where he describes where he died
as a medical student in 1943

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.170 align:middle line:10%
because of double pneumonia.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.790 align:middle line:84%
But after nine minutes
of death, he came back,

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and he had a very extensive
near-death experience.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:84%
So I was so impressed
by this book

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that I started in '86
to ask a patient who

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.075 align:middle line:84%
had survived the cardiac arrest
if he could remember something

00:05:10.075 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
from a period of
unconsciousness,

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:84%
from the period
of cardiac arrest.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And to my big surprise,
within two years,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:84%
out of 50 patients who
survived cardiac arrest,

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:84%
12 patients shared
their NDE with me.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And that started my
scientific curiosity,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:84%
because I've always learned it's
impossible to have experienced

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, let alone
enhance consciousness

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:84%
with the possibility of
perception out and above

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:90%
your body.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
With cognition, with
emotion, with memories,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
with meeting deceased relatives,
it should be impossible.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.720 align:middle line:10%
So that's why we started
the study in 1988

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:10%
to see if there could be
a scientific explanation

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:10%
for the cause and
content of the NDE.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.135 align:middle line:84%
There was only one question
we had in our study,

00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and still use the
same question, do you

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.220 align:middle line:84%
have memories from the
period of unconsciousness?

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.512 align:middle line:84%
Do you have memories from
the period of cardiac arrest.

00:05:58.512 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:90%
And they say no or they say why.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And when they say why, it
takes another hour because they

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:90%
wanted to tell you.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.740 align:middle line:90%
And I know from all the stories.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I've met thousands
of people with NDE

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and also tens of thousands of
emails from all over the world.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
doctors don't listen.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Nurses are a little bit better.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Family members, friends
will not listen.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.630 align:middle line:84%
A partner is not able
to listen as well.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So there is a divorce
rate of more than 75%

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.950 align:middle line:84%
because it's not the
person who married before.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And doctors say it's
just an hallucination.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a dream.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a side effect of drugs.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Here, you have some medication.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:90%
It will go over.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:90%
So they keep silent.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I have met people who have
been silent for 50 years

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:84%
because they could
not share with others.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I know also from the church that
people have went to the minister

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:84%
to share their story, and the
minister said, get out of here.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:90%
It was Satan.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I shared my experience with
close friends and with some

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
family, and it took me many
years to share it with, really,

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:90%
all of them.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
The hard part was, for the
first about four or five years,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:84%
every time I would try to
talk about the experience,

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:90%
I would just cry.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of that
love that I would feel there.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:84%
It's so hard to
even allow yourself

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.010 align:middle line:84%
mentally to go there
without feeling all that.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And I knew not to meet any
more with the neurologists

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:84%
because they kept trying to say
that everything was explainable

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and that the
supplement that I took

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:90%
was making my blood thinner.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:84%
That made it so that the
body didn't go fully dead,

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:90%
but it was dead.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.358 align:middle line:90%
I know it was dead.

00:07:36.358 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And I know because
I was watching it.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.305 align:middle line:90%
The body was fully dead.

00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And neurologists don't like
to talk about seeing your body

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:90%
while you're above it.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.562 align:middle line:84%
I've never found one of them
that likes to talk about that.

00:07:49.562 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think one problem
with the near-death experience

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
is it's so profound
and unexpected.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Certainly for me, as someone
like a materialist who

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
had gone through, wrestled
with these items through life,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.240 align:middle line:84%
thought, well, I just don't
see a way that it can happen.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:90%
And then going through it all.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:84%
It's shocking, and
it's so ultra real,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.770 align:middle line:84%
it's such a different
mode of knowing

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:84%
that often people come back
and think, well, if I try

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and tell somebody that,
they'll think I'm crazy.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
But when I first woke up, all I
knew was where I had just been,

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:90%
this extraordinary journey.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So trying to make sense of it,
I would explain to my doctors

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual fascination
of an incredible realm.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And they would just
pat me on the back

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, your
brain was soaking in pus.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:84%
The dying brain plays
all kinds of tricks,

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:90%
so you can just forget about it.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Nowadays there's a broad
familiarity with these

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
experiences, so people are more
comfortable talking about them.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But when I was doing this
research in the 1960s

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and '70s, many of the people I
talked to had never told anybody

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.040 align:middle line:90%
else except me about it.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.940 align:middle line:84%
They realized that nobody
was going to believe them,

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:84%
that people would think
that they were mentally ill.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And a few of them
had actually tried

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.740 align:middle line:84%
to tell their
physician who said,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:84%
oh, that was just a
hallucination, and dismiss it.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
They had tried to tell their
minister who said, well,

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:90%
that's out of my territory.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So there was nobody
for them to talk to.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It was very hard to process.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:90%
It's so hard to describe.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I would try to share it
with people at church,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.137 align:middle line:84%
and they were very
put off by it.

00:09:27.137 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, oh, I'll get
invited to all these churches

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:90%
to speak.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Never happened.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to understand
this experience that I've had.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Everybody around me
thinks I'm crazy.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was really putting
a strain on my relationship

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.840 align:middle line:90%
with myself and my husband.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> It really takes a lot of guts
and love to give this story out

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:84%
because some people can
question it, and that's fine.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if anybody
questions it or not.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:90%
I know it's the truth for me.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I know it's my life
that it happened in.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And I got so much education
from many other people who

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.260 align:middle line:90%
had had near-death experiences.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.560 align:middle line:84%
It made me feel normal, like
other people are having them,

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.200 align:middle line:90%
it's not just me.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a conference in the
US about near-death experiences.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So there was about 300 people
there have been lectures

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.060 align:middle line:90%
about near-death experience.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:10%
And at the end, a man
stood up and said,

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm a cardiologist for
more than 25 years,

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:10%
I've never heard
such absurd stories.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe one word of it.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Then another man stood up
in the audience and said,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of your patients.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I've had a near-death
experience in cardiac arrest,

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and you would be the last
one I would ever tell.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:84%
They know that these
kind of doctors

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:90%
are not willing to listen.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the funny
things that happened was,

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:52.660 align:middle line:84%
the first talk I gave on this to
a medical community was in '73.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I finished my talk, the
first person to hold up his hand

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:90%
was one of my own professors.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:90%
He was an anatomy professor.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, this is
very interesting.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm interested.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:84%
He said, but I've been in
medicine a long time, why

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:90%
haven't I ever heard of this?

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So I just said, well, has
anybody here ever heard of this?

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And this doctor's wife put up
her hand and she said, yes, yes.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And she said, don't you remember
our friend Helen came over

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:90%
and she was talking about this?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.450 align:middle line:90%
And so it's that people--

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:84%
some people, this is just too
much and they won't hear it.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a matter of
volume of numbers of cases.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:84%
The real difficulty is
the conceptual apparatus

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:90%
for how we think about this.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So a near-death experience
is the reported memory of a lot

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.340 align:middle line:84%
of impressions during a
special state of consciousness.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And this special
state of consciousness

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
can happen during a
critical medical situation,

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:90%
like cardiac arrest.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:90%
You can have it in a coma.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But until we started
our prospective study,

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:84%
the main explanation
was lack of oxygen

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle line:84%
in your brain, A hallucination,
dreams, just fancy tales trying

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to be interesting, et cetera,
a side effect of drugs.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:84%
But it had never been proven, so
we needed to prospective study

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:84%
to see if we could
find an explanation

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.210 align:middle line:84%
for the causal
content of an NDE.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.360 align:middle line:10%
And what we found is 18%
of those patients who

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.130 align:middle line:10%
survived a cardiac
arrest told us

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.850 align:middle line:10%
about their
near-death experience.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And 82% did not have
any memory at all.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And we compared the two
groups of patients, the group

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:90%
with and without an NDE.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.220 align:middle line:84%
There was no, to our
surprise, difference

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.092 align:middle line:84%
at all in the duration
of cardiac arrest.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It was two minutes
or eight minutes

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
or the duration of
unconsciousness.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.390 align:middle line:84%
If it was five minutes
or three weeks of coma,

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.560 align:middle line:84%
the severity of the lack
of oxygen in the brain

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.890 align:middle line:90%
did not matter at all.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:50.860 align:middle line:84%
We could exclude
the lack of oxygen

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
in the brain because
of our study.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And also, we could exclude
side effects of drugs.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:84%
There was no difference
in the medication.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:90%
People had with and without.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Fear of death, the
psychological explanation,

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.660 align:middle line:90%
did not matter at all.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.548 align:middle line:90%
Education, gender, religion.

00:13:05.548 --> 00:13:07.465 align:middle line:84%
If they were Christian,
or atheist, or Muslim,

00:13:07.465 --> 00:13:08.890 align:middle line:90%
it didn't matter at all.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So there was no scientific
explanation at all

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:84%
to explain why people have
an NDE during cardiac arrest.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And one thing when you
actually study delusion,

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:84%
so I actually did do a
little research on my own,

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:84%
oxygen to the brain is still
required to have a delusion.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:10%
So to be no oxygen to
the brain as long as I

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:10%
was, at least an
hour, possibly two,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.470 align:middle line:10%
according to different people
how they rate how much time I

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:10%
was actually dead, it
was impossible to be

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:10%
having any delusion.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> There's all this talk
of people trying to give

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:84%
a physiological or a clinical
explanation for a near-death

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.340 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So commonly, those
arguments are, well,

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
the brain was deprived
of oxygen and there's

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:84%
chemicals being shot around
in the brain that will cause

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:90%
these hallucinatory events.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:90%
That was not the case for me.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I was in a coma,
my oxygen levels

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.750 align:middle line:84%
were being controlled
by a ventilator.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Then they'll say, oh, it's the
drugs, those drugs that they use

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:84%
to induce coma or
induce deep sleep

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.840 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, those are
causing hallucinations.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.680 align:middle line:84%
But the nature of hallucinations
is that they're very confusing.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
They're jumbled, and they
don't seem to make sense,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:90%
they're not cohesive.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.410 align:middle line:84%
The memory of them
fades with time.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't see that with
near-death experiences.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:84%
When those people come back
and describe their experiences,

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:84%
they're very lucid, they're
ordered, they're chronological,

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and they tend to open up
more the longer that you

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:90%
process them.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many different
mechanisms that materialist

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:84%
scientists come up with to try
and explain away near-death

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.342 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
pretend that they're just

00:14:47.342 --> 00:14:51.190 align:middle line:84%
hallucinations or some chaotic
action of the dying brain.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.210 align:middle line:84%
But what they're missing
is, for one thing,

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.780 align:middle line:84%
the similarity of near-death
experiences across all kinds

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.260 align:middle line:90%
of disease states.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.220 align:middle line:84%
If all these different brain
mechanisms were active,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't we see a lot of
very different experiences.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the experiences
have tremendous commonalities

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, it's
not at all uncommon

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:84%
for near-death experiencers
whose mental awareness has been

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:84%
liberated to that level to
be aware of ongoing actions

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:84%
in the here and now,
in the physical world.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Anita
Moorjani's case,

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
as she was deep in
the spiritual realm,

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.200 align:middle line:84%
she was fully in touch
with her brother.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:84%
He was on a plane flying
from India to Hong Kong,

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:90%
possibly for her funeral.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And yet, she could
connect with him

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and know exactly what was going
on in his mind at a distance.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But simultaneously,
she was able to connect

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:84%
with the soul of her
father, who had passed over

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.820 align:middle line:90%
and had very profound lessons.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> We hear all these cases,
and I've seen them myself,

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:84%
where the person, while
they were out of their body,

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:84%
seems to be able to see
something in the room

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:84%
or the scene of the
resuscitation where it is

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:90%
subsequently confirmed.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very puzzling
and interesting thing,

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.980 align:middle line:90%
and I hear it all the time.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But then you get into a
question not of medicine,

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:90%
but of epistemology.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.600 align:middle line:84%
The question then is, can we
know that these things are real?

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
impressed by the fact

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.200 align:middle line:84%
that people who have
these experiences, they

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
all unanimously assure
me that not only was

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:84%
their experience real, but
that it was more real than what

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:90%
we're going through now.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>> When you have a
near-death experience,

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:47.350 align:middle line:84%
it is more real than the current
environment that you're in.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't question it
at all as a hallucination

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:90%
or a dream, no.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I was out of my body
watching what they were doing

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:90%
down below to resuscitate me.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.680 align:middle line:90%
I heard them calling code blue.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:90%
I saw the flatline.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:90%
I knew that I was dead.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was up above
my body on the ceiling.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And there was no question
about that at all.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so vivid, this
kind of memory of the NDE.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And they say, being
back in the body,

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
this physical world around
me is like an illusion.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
But what happened to
me in my consciousness,

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
in the higher dimension,
that's more real than real.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:90%
They just feel home.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.820 align:middle line:90%
They don't believe anymore.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:90%
They know.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:90%
They've been there.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that is one
of the most astonishing

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
characteristics of
these experiences.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
People often assume that
they'll be vague, and murky,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and dream like,
well, I'll tell you

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:84%
that having been there, this
world, this material world

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.330 align:middle line:84%
is vague, and murky,
and dreamlike.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:84%
That world of the
spiritual realm

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:84%
is sharp, clear,
crisp, transformative.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
You remember those
events for decades,

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:90%
they do not fade from memory.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
It's really astonishing
how powerful

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:84%
the ultra reality
of that realm is.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes these
stories ineffable, so difficult

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
to describe, because from
that eternal perspective,

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.800 align:middle line:84%
you can see the connections
so much more readily

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and everything makes
far more sense.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I've talked with people who
were not religious and who were

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:90%
religious.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I've realized is
that it really doesn't matter.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:84%
The language itself
fails no matter

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:84%
what your religion
was, that there

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle line:84%
isn't any conceptual scheme
that is satisfactory to try

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:90%
to make sense of this.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>> My experience there
was more real than here.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's hard to
explain with words,

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:84%
but truly, there is
the real existence.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:84%
There is the real colors you
see, the real energy you see,

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and you just know things
that you shouldn't know.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And some of that has had
a lingering effect on me.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
There's been many
times in my life

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
where I go into a
deep state of hypnosis

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.890 align:middle line:84%
or a deep state of
meditation, and I can actually

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:90%
get myself there again.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It's always vivid.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.410 align:middle line:84%
They still keep it alive
even though it might

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.960 align:middle line:90%
have happened decades before.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean, by the
way, that these things

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.860 align:middle line:90%
are easy to figure out.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is really a
very difficult question.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we need some new way to
investigate this kind of thing.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Most materialist-based
scientists have to believe

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:41.100 align:middle line:84%
in a never proven assumption,
that the brain produces

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:84%
It's their dogma, it's
their belief system.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:84%
But based on scientific
research in patients

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:84%
who survived cardiac arrest,
when the brain doesn't function

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:84%
at all, you have the
possibility of perception

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.980 align:middle line:90%
out and above your body.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Blind people can perceive, deaf
people know what has been said.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can ask the doctors, and
nurses, and family members what

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:90%
really happened at what time.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So that means this corroboration
proves that without a brain

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:90%
function, you have perception.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:10%
That's impossible.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:10%
It should be impossible,
but it happens.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So you can ignore
the new findings

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.950 align:middle line:90%
or you can change the paradigm.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The traditional model is
really one of brain creates

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, that is what we
can see happening in the brain,

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.250 align:middle line:84%
like with functional MRI,
magnetoencephalography,

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:84%
those kind of techniques, they
should correlate with things

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:84%
that occur in phenomenal
consciousness.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And the general
idea in materialists

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:84%
is that the material
itself of the brain

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:90%
is causing all of that.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And because the
material in the brain

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
is subject to the laws of
physics, chemistry, and biology,

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.740 align:middle line:84%
when you pay attention
to that argument, what

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.080 align:middle line:84%
they're telling you is
you do not have free will.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:84%
They're saying
that consciousness

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:84%
is an epiphenomenon of these
chemical reactions and electron

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.350 align:middle line:84%
fluxes, so there's no
place for free will.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:90%
It's all an illusion.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that's where
they're absolutely wrong.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And especially when you start
to acknowledge the grander forms

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, like
remote viewing, telepathy,

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:84%
showing us that we're
really dealing more

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:90%
with a primordial mind.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing is
a skill people can

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:84%
learn to discern information
not only across space,

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:90%
but across time.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the scientific
community that is open

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.720 align:middle line:84%
minded scientists
who actually study

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.240 align:middle line:84%
these cases in human
beings who have them

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and then try and
explain it all, it's

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:84%
very comforting that they are
supporting the reality of this.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
beginning to realize

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
is the arrow of causality
is not brain events cause

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:84%
mental and phenomenal events,
but it works the other way

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.620 align:middle line:84%
around, that, in
fact, mind over matter

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:84%
is the general
principle at work here.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's an extraordinary
gift of understanding

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.050 align:middle line:84%
because it helps us
understand the afterlife, all

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.600 align:middle line:84%
the scientific evidence
for reincarnation.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Every bit of it starts
to make more sense when

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.910 align:middle line:84%
we see the brain not as a
producer of consciousness,

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
but as a reducing valve, or
filter, or transceiver that

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:84%
allows that primordial mind
to project a little eddy

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.420 align:middle line:84%
current of consciousness that
we interpret as our own mind,

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and yet ultimately,
they're all linked together

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:84%
as we traverse through
that veil and reunite

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:90%
with that primordial mind.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And so for me, the
brain is a transceiver.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And to understand that, I always
compare it with the internet.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:84%
There are 1 million YouTube
films and 1 million websites

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.550 align:middle line:84%
at this very moment going
through you, through these walls

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.560 align:middle line:84%
It's always available
everywhere in the world,

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.180 align:middle line:84%
this electromagnetic
information field.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:84%
But you need an
instrument to receive it

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and you put on your computer,
you receive some internet,

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:84%
but your computer does
not produce the internet,

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.240 align:middle line:90%
it receives it.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So you receive your own
waking consciousness,

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.380 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
code you have, you

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.630 align:middle line:84%
receive your personal
consciousness.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So death, for me, is the
end of a physical body,

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
but not the end of
our consciousness.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.645 align:middle line:84%
But the whole study
we did took 10 years

00:23:10.645 --> 00:23:13.270 align:middle line:90%
and was without funding at all.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.780 align:middle line:84%
There were some doctors in
hospitals who were open,

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:90%
but the majority was not.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Usually they're not
interested at all

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't fit
in our current worldview.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And most debunkers of
materialist-based scientists

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:84%
don't want to know about
these new findings.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.860 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
their literature,

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
so it's hard to discuss
with them because they're

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.890 align:middle line:90%
just full of their own dogma.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:90%
They're frightened.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the problem
with materialist science,

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.880 align:middle line:84%
is their main approach to this
has been to debunk and deny,

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.440 align:middle line:90%
to dismiss.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.930 align:middle line:84%
There are scientists on
record saying my case was

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.190 align:middle line:90%
nonsense, how could it happen?

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the big
mystery, how could it happen?

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.350 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we're
trying to explain.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:84%
But when scientists obscure
data, when they intentionally

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:84%
cover up, debunk,
deny, sweep evidence

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.230 align:middle line:84%
under the rug, all they're
doing is cheating themselves.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
We need to take all
of human experience

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and try and come up with
a better explanation.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:10%
That's where I think
the scientific study

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, and
this includes the science

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.940 align:middle line:10%
of near-death experiences,
the science of reincarnation,

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.050 align:middle line:10%
because that data is
extremely powerful and really

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:26.850 align:middle line:10%
overwhelming.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:27.720 align:middle line:10%
You can't deny it.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.240 align:middle line:10%
Once you start to
read that data,

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:10%
and understand how
it was assembled,

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:10%
and the respect
for the scientists

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:10%
like Ian Stevenson
and Jim Tucker

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.220 align:middle line:10%
at the University of Virginia
who put it all together,

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.790 align:middle line:10%
and we realized that
it's really up to science

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.400 align:middle line:10%
to accept all the
empirical data and then try

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:10%
to make sense of it.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
finally happening.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I am a skeptic, by the
way, and I want to say that

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.230 align:middle line:84%
because unfortunately, people
who call themselves skeptics

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.830 align:middle line:84%
about near-death experiences
don't know what they're talking

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And as a skeptic,
I still realize

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that you can't draw a logical
conclusion that there's

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:84%
an afterlife, its
logic forbids it.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know what else.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Where I have come up
is that I just give up.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I have always, all my life,
been able to think myself out

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:23.360 align:middle line:84%
of anything, but I can't
think myself out of the idea

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
that to my utter
surprise and still

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.970 align:middle line:84%
very counterintuitive
to me, that I

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:90%
gather there is an afterlife.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:36.542 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a conclusion,
it's just that I give up.

00:25:36.542 --> 00:25:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I've run out of ways to
think my way out of it.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is beyond our
current material science.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness does not
exist in material science,

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.270 align:middle line:84%
so they call it an illusion, but
it's the essence of who we are.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The issue is we really
need to expand our lexicon,

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:90%
our language.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:84%
We need to expand our mind
about understanding this.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:10%
But even though the
words I use might

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.860 align:middle line:10%
sound a little foreign
to some people,

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.710 align:middle line:10%
there were thousands of people
who responded to the words

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:10%
I used in the book Proof of
Heaven who reached out to me

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:10%
and said, I've never shared
this with anyone else,

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:19.810 align:middle line:10%
but-- and they would
share their story with me.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You change the way you
are and the way you live,

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:84%
but it takes years of
loneliness, homesickness,

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:90%
and depression.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So a near-death experience
is a spiritual trauma.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But as soon that you can start
to accept your experience,

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:84%
then the second
phase is to start

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.650 align:middle line:84%
to integrate it into
your life, that you

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.840 align:middle line:90%
change the way you live.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's not that easy at all.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the challenge,
to be back in the body.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:10%
>> They say that, yeah, you
have this moment of instant

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.080 align:middle line:10%
ascension, where
you see everything,

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.620 align:middle line:10%
but then you come back down
here and then you're in that

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.530 align:middle line:10%
struggling part of life.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.400 align:middle line:10%
>> It was very difficult
to get through.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.243 align:middle line:10%
I kept getting sick.

00:27:05.243 --> 00:27:07.160 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't figure out
what was wrong with me,

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.220 align:middle line:84%
so I kept going back
into the hospital.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had 18 episodes of
respiratory failure in 2 and 1/2

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:10%
And I had made friends
with this person named

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:10%
Brian, who runs a support
group, called Grief 2 Growth,

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:10%
for people who've lost a child.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:10%
And he had invited me several
times to come on his show

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.530 align:middle line:10%
and share my story.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:25.988 align:middle line:84%
And I would come
up with any reason

00:27:25.988 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:90%
I could think of not to do it.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So the last time that I went
into respiratory failure,

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.670 align:middle line:90%
I was in the hospital.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:90%
I popped out of my body again.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I was back on the other side and
I was angry with God and I said,

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:84%
just heal me or take
me, what are you doing?

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's
not me, it's you.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what
do you mean it's me?

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.360 align:middle line:10%
These doctors can't figure
out what's going on.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:10%
I can't fix this.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you can fix this?

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.170 align:middle line:84%
You said you were
going to go back.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.080 align:middle line:90%
You said you were going to live.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And every time I put an
opportunity in front of you

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.230 align:middle line:84%
or somebody for you
to love, you say no.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to go back and live?

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:04.050 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.973 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, then
start saying yes.

00:28:05.973 --> 00:28:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought it was the
most ridiculous thing I ever

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.190 align:middle line:90%
heard.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I said, so you're
telling me if I go back

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and I start saying, yes,
I'm going to be healed?

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.293 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:28:15.293 --> 00:28:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, that sounds
like the most insane thing I've

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.520 align:middle line:84%
ever heard, but it's
God, I'll give it a shot.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So I get home, Brian
calls or texts me

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and he says, hey, when
you get to feeling better,

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd love for you to
come up to Cincinnati

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and share your story
with our ions group.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And before I could even
stop myself, I said yes.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And I went and did that
talk, and I have never

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.780 align:middle line:90%
had another episode since.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is why people who
come back from these things just

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:46.750 align:middle line:84%
so regularly say that whatever
they were chasing before.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Everybody seems to
be chasing something.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I've spent my whole
life chasing knowledge.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Some people spend
their life chasing

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.600 align:middle line:84%
money, or fame, or
power, or whatever

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:90%
it is they were chasing.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%
But they say after this, you
realize that what this is all

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.860 align:middle line:90%
about is learning to love.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And when they get
back, they have

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.470 align:middle line:84%
that ideal or that
perception, but it still

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.090 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make it any easier.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.710 align:middle line:84%
People say that, you're still
grounded as a human being.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.710 align:middle line:84%
The way I like to describe
it as a psychiatrist,

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that for most of us, it's hard
to get through the average day

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.645 align:middle line:84%
without wanting to choke
at least one person.

00:29:29.645 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:90%
That's human reality.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And you are still
in that framework,

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:40.542 align:middle line:84%
but you have a goal or something
you're looking for out there.

00:29:40.542 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And the transformation, we
know from patients with NDEs,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:90%
is no fear of death anymore.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.880 align:middle line:84%
New insight, what is
important in life,

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.270 align:middle line:84%
empathy, compassion
first towards yourself,

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:84%
accept your own negative aspects
we all have, and also accept

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and have compassion towards
others and towards nature.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about unconditional
love, about connection.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything you do to others
will come back to you.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Hate and aggression will come
back to you when you die.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And giving love to others
will come back to you as well.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Because another terminology
for near-death experience

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.310 align:middle line:84%
is experience of oneness,
you connect with everybody,

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:20.330 align:middle line:90%
with everything.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And the third aspect is
enhanced intuitive sensitivity.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.410 align:middle line:84%
If you know what other
people feel and think,

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:84%
you can see future
events, et cetera.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And the people are very
reluctant to share this

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.070 align:middle line:84%
with others because
you have to ask for it.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The blessings that it
has brought to me are just

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:39.010 align:middle line:90%
incredible.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.440 align:middle line:90%
I had a new husband.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I had a wonderful
guy who I married,

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:90%
That's an ex basketball player.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And we have together his two,
my two, and our baby together,

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:50.430 align:middle line:90%
five kids.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And it changes who you are
and gives you this perspective

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.770 align:middle line:90%
of helping others.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.360 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not perfect,
but I do want

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:10%
to try to help people, and
give what I can to others,

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:08.120 align:middle line:10%
and spend my time in a valuable
way of just even just talking

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.610 align:middle line:10%
to someone who needs
a listening ear.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And up on the
ceiling, I was shown

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that there was other work that I
was supposed to do with my life,

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:84%
there was purpose that
I needed to complete.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think I'm doing that
with what I do in my life now.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Then you changed
the way you live.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's not anymore
about money, about power,

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and there's no death anymore,
they believe in an afterlife.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a continuity
of consciousness

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.130 align:middle line:90%
after the death of the body.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So death is like birth, a
changing state of consciousness,

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:48.140 align:middle line:90%
that there will never be an end.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The first time I had
someone close to me die after

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.850 align:middle line:90%
my experience, it was weird.

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.730 align:middle line:90%
There was this dual suffering.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I was suffering that I
was losing a loved one,

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:84%
but at the same
time, I was jealous.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I had this jealousy that, why
did they get to go before me?

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.900 align:middle line:84%
It's weird to say, but once
you're there, you understand it.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:84%
You understand that you're
excited when your day comes,

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.170 align:middle line:84%
you don't hide from it,
you're not worried about it.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Whereas a lot of other
people, they're freaking out.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.650 align:middle line:84%
But if they really knew what
was there to greet them,

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't be
freaking out ever.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I've already been
where this life is past

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not actively
trying to bring that on,

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm respecting God's plan
and the creator's plan,

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.160 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, I'm
not afraid of it at all.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>> So many people fear that.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:84%
They fear their infirmity
and their death.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And I don't fear
any of those things.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I know they're
coming for all of us,

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and I know what's
on the other side,

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.730 align:middle line:90%
and I'm ready to go whenever.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But I've lost my cousin
who was beloved to me

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.620 align:middle line:90%
since my near-death experience.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.078 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when
I got the news,

00:32:57.078 --> 00:32:59.203 align:middle line:84%
I took it just like anybody
else who would not have

00:32:59.203 --> 00:33:00.390 align:middle line:90%
had a near-death experience.

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I remember the room shifted
and I almost fell down.

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was crying,
and I was thinking,

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:90%
who is crying so loudly?

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And it was surreal.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's still hard, but
it's not as hard as it was.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And death is very
neglected in our culture.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:20.330 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
everybody's scared of,

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:90%
they're scared to talk about it.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It has been known in all
religions, and all cultures,

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and all times that
death is not the end.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But we have lost this knowledge
in the last 300 years.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So death is for a lot
of people still a taboo.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.500 align:middle line:90%
People have fear.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.520 align:middle line:84%
They believe that death is
the end of everything we are.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.370 align:middle line:84%
That was my idea as well when I
was a young doctor, I thought,

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.210 align:middle line:84%
death is the end of
everything we are.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But I've changed my
ideas because I've

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.990 align:middle line:90%
met so many people with NDE.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people that people
with NDE have been my teachers,

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.910 align:middle line:84%
they have learned me that
death is not the end.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:03.007 align:middle line:84%
>> And so if you know
going in that any day--

00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
my parents are getting
older, any day,

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I could get a call that
I've lost one of my parents.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I know that that is
eventually coming.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:90%
We all have an expiration date.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.739 align:middle line:84%
And so when it comes,
because I know that

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm facing that reality,
yes, it's going to be difficult,

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:20.340 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going to be
totally knocked flat by it.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.469 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get through
it and we'll somehow

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:90%
be better on the other side.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The goal is, for all of us,
that as those who do around us

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:33.330 align:middle line:84%
pass, as they cross over,
that we love them through it,

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that we love them
into their transition.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And as we love them, it makes
their transition even easier.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:43.389 align:middle line:84%
And if we can, if we believe
in this, pray for them.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.630 align:middle line:84%
It's going to help them
through their transition

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to help us
being OK that they transitioned

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.550 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I do lose someone,
one of all three of the elderly

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.240 align:middle line:84%
people that passed
on in my life, yes,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to miss them terribly
with the interactions that we

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.130 align:middle line:84%
had and the relationship
we had developed,

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:08.030 align:middle line:84%
but I know that they're fine
up there on the other side.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I know that at home,
they are perfectly well.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>> People who come back from a
near-death experience say they

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:90%
have no more fear of death.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And that has rubbed
off on me for sure.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.670 align:middle line:90%
I am not afraid of death.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Pain is something
I'm afraid of, but I

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:32.050 align:middle line:84%
have this confidence that, well,
this is not everything there is.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, it
focuses your attention

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.850 align:middle line:84%
on what it means to
be alive now, what

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.533 align:middle line:90%
is it about us that survives?

00:35:41.533 --> 00:35:44.070 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And the real beauty of the
journey is demonstrated to those

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.520 align:middle line:84%
who have had
near-death experiences.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And they will tell you, there
is nothing to fear about death.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Death is a natural transition,
it's part of the soul journey.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, our souls
come back again and again

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:84%
in this process of reaching
towards oneness with the divine

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.210 align:middle line:84%
in that state of enlightenment,
which is what all of us

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:09.160 align:middle line:90%
are headed for ultimately.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:10%
>> And about the fear of death,
perhaps we didn't talk about it,

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.650 align:middle line:10%
is after death communication.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So in the first days or weeks
after the death of a loved one,

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:21.880 align:middle line:84%
there's a huge
possibility that you

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.620 align:middle line:84%
will be in contact
with the consciousness

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.500 align:middle line:84%
of deceased relative, usually to
tell them, I'm all right here.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:29.920 align:middle line:90%
It's fine with me.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.550 align:middle line:84%
About 125 million
people in Europe

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:35.290 align:middle line:84%
have this after
death communication,

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:38.210 align:middle line:84%
usually during sleep, because
the threshold of consciousness

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:39.010 align:middle line:90%
is lower.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:42.040 align:middle line:10%
So people who have died
have more possibility

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.010 align:middle line:10%
to have access to the
consciousness of the people

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.780 align:middle line:10%
up here on Earth.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.780 align:middle line:10%
And they call it a
dream, but usually, you

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.870 align:middle line:10%
don't remember a dream.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.740 align:middle line:84%
But this is such a-- we call
it a conscious experience

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.020 align:middle line:84%
during sleep, you
will never forget it.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.550 align:middle line:10%
The contact with the one
who died is so impressive,

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:02.350 align:middle line:10%
sometimes you get
information it's

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.290 align:middle line:10%
impossible to know beforehand.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:08.020 align:middle line:10%
And it happened so often,
but they don't talk about it

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.190 align:middle line:10%
because when you try
to talk about it,

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.630 align:middle line:10%
it's all just a dream,
it's just your morning,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.450 align:middle line:10%
don't believe it, et cetera.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same as the
perimortem experience, where

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.280 align:middle line:84%
you are asleep and you
get awake at 4 o'clock.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:90%
You think of your father.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:22.830 align:middle line:90%
You get sad, et cetera.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
morning, you get

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:27.532 align:middle line:84%
a phone call that your father
died at that very moment.

00:37:27.532 --> 00:37:29.240 align:middle line:84%
There are so many,
many things happening,

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.240 align:middle line:84%
but people are so
reluctant to share it.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And the same kind
of experience can

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.750 align:middle line:84%
happen in the terminal
phase of illness,

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:39.380 align:middle line:84%
what we call the end of
life experiences as well.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a lot of patients that
were at the end of their life,

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and I've had a few experiences
where I could see the crossover.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I had one patient who seemed
to be on a different level,

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.760 align:middle line:90%
and he was actively dying.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into the room
and he said, oh, John, this

00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:59.610 align:middle line:90%
is my nurse, Penny.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately
was like, what?

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:02.940 align:middle line:90%
He's hallucinating.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And I realized immediately
he was talking to somebody

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.230 align:middle line:90%
who had already passed.

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, I'm sorry, I said,
do you guys need a minute?

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I was going in
the room to do something.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, no,
no, come in, sit down.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.490 align:middle line:90%
This is my brother, John.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said, are you going to
be leaving with John soon?

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, I
think John came to get me.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.760 align:middle line:90%
I think we will be leaving soon.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.900 align:middle line:90%
And he passed the next day.

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.720 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen some of
those situations, where

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.380 align:middle line:84%
their doctors will write it
off to the medications or just

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.060 align:middle line:90%
the dysfunction of a dying mind.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.890 align:middle line:84%
But to me, when I watch the
patients interact that way,

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:38.480 align:middle line:84%
they're very lucid,
they're more lucid

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.170 align:middle line:84%
than they were before they
started interacting that way.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:84%
They suddenly seem very sharp
and acute with their senses.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And he even told me
not to sit in the chair

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.660 align:middle line:90%
that John was sitting in.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've had things like
that happen more than once,

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:54.450 align:middle line:84%
where you can see this
transitionary space that they're

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:58.380 align:middle line:84%
in before they
completely cross over.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what we call the
end of life experiences.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.920 align:middle line:10%
You have to know that they will
die and they can see light,

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:10%
they can see deceased relatives,
like a deceased partner,

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.920 align:middle line:10%
or deceased parents, or
deceased child as well.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Children will see angels.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And it happens just in
the hours, days, or weeks

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:90%
before they die.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.607 align:middle line:90%
And they can talk about it.

00:39:19.607 --> 00:39:21.440 align:middle line:84%
The difference with a
near-death experience,

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.690 align:middle line:90%
they are unconscious.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.780 align:middle line:84%
But when you have an
end of life experience,

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.968 align:middle line:84%
you're in and out this
waking consciousness.

00:39:26.968 --> 00:39:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So they can tell about what
happens, and what they see,

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and what they
experience as well.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:34.980 align:middle line:84%
We know from other studies
that presumably more than 80%

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.100 align:middle line:84%
of people who are dying have
this kind of experiences,

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.160 align:middle line:84%
but unfortunately, most of
these end of life experiences

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
are not recognized and
called an hallucination.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.650 align:middle line:84%
But also in other
circumstances, you

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:50.490 align:middle line:84%
can have this kind of
experiences, existential crisis,

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:54.420 align:middle line:90%
isolation, meditation.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> After this happened to
me, I was praying so hard,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and so heavy every day to
please let me back in heaven,

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:07.600 align:middle line:90%
to please let me back in heaven.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And every single
time the answer would

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.600 align:middle line:84%
come, I know this is
going to be hard, Vinnie,

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.540 align:middle line:90%
but it's going to be worth it.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And about eight weeks after my
experience, I met a real angel.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:20.940 align:middle line:90%
I met my wife.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And she helped me on my
transition of the old me

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.540 align:middle line:90%
to becoming the new me.

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.200 align:middle line:84%
She helped me into this
new era of my life,

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.760 align:middle line:84%
where family matters, where
loving others matters,

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.910 align:middle line:84%
where caring for
others is paramount.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So I died in January, came
back three days later.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And that following July,
I was engaged to my wife

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and we went to a little
tiny town in Wyoming,

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.730 align:middle line:90%
called Afton, Wyoming.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.290 align:middle line:90%
We're there at a family reunion.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:57.030 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the history of the
town performed in front of us

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:90%
at the local high school.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.130 align:middle line:10%
And we're watching the men and
women who created this town,

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.710 align:middle line:10%
they're showing pictures
of different people.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:09.390 align:middle line:84%
My wife looked over and
she said, that's him.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I had described Drake, my
guide, so many times to her

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.460 align:middle line:84%
that she felt she
really knew who he was.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And she saw this picture come
up on the screen and she said,

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:21.460 align:middle line:90%
that's him.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized
absolutely it was him.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:84%
There was no
question it was him.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And it helped solidify
that it really

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:35.420 align:middle line:84%
did happen because me being
who I am, I'm very analytical,

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.110 align:middle line:84%
and I was starting to
believe some of the stories

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that neurologists
tried to tell me,

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of these experiences
are just delusions made up

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.770 align:middle line:84%
in our imagination,
and it's just the brain

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:49.780 align:middle line:90%
trying to fill in the gaps.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
possible way for me

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to make up a character
that really existed,

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:58.450 align:middle line:84%
who I never met
before in my life.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
got as a confirmation

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:03.880 align:middle line:90%
that, yes, he was real.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So to me, Drake's
one of my angels.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:09.160 align:middle line:84%
He's one of my guides,
one of my protectors.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And months later, I
got the opportunity

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.860 align:middle line:84%
to move in with my grandmother
to help take care of her

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.280 align:middle line:90%
at the end of her life.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And while we were there, we were
going through some old paperwork

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:20.030 align:middle line:90%
with her.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And we have one file
that says, "D. Cazier."

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:27.940 align:middle line:10%
We open it up, and it's all
this stuff about Drake Cazier,

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:32.500 align:middle line:10%
about my guide, who he was in
real life, and then about a page

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.010 align:middle line:10%
to a page and a half of
all the important things he

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.470 align:middle line:10%
was going to do after
this life, after he dies.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the primary
duties he was going to embody

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:47.080 align:middle line:84%
was to be a guide or an
escort to his family,

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:52.000 align:middle line:84%
to his loved ones, and to anyone
who called out for his help.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So it was really a beautiful
kind of a third confirmation

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:59.230 align:middle line:84%
for me that not
only was he real,

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:01.990 align:middle line:84%
but he was fulfilling
a foretelling

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:05.380 align:middle line:84%
of what his life purpose
was, not just in this world,

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.516 align:middle line:90%
but in the eternities.

00:43:06.516 --> 00:43:09.550 align:middle line:90%


00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they can
see us if they want to.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.370 align:middle line:84%
When there are problems,
they will be there.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And the personality, the essence
of who we are is the same.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the ego with all the hate,
and the jealousy, whatever--

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.880 align:middle line:90%
this is gone.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So the essence of who we
are, the personality traits,

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:31.070 align:middle line:90%
are kept forever.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's become
one with everything

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.200 align:middle line:90%
in the higher dimension.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.000 align:middle line:90%
