00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:15.376 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:28.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is
Vinney Todd Tolman.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And before my near-death
experience as a youthful,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
young 20-something year old,
I was out exploring life.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd traveled the world,
done many different jobs.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And I used to do bodybuilding
or amateur bodybuilding.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And back in January 18, 2003,
it started with a new supplement

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:84%
that me and a really good friend
of mine had purchased online.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:84%
We decided, hey, we're going
to take this on a Saturday.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go up
and see a car show, do

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:84%
a workout at the gym, and
just have a fun Saturday.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So we get there to
hit my buddy's place.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
We took this new
supplement and immediately

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:90%
felt something was wrong.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It felt almost as
if cold ice started

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:90%
pumping through our veins.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It felt like our whole body
was starting to get cold.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And I explained to my buddy
that, hey, we should probably

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:84%
go get something
to eat, otherwise

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be really sick.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So we went down the street a few
blocks to this fast food joint.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:90%
We go in there.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I go in, I went
straight into the bathroom.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was going
to throw up or vomit.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
My buddy, he went in, he
collapsed on the first booth

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:84%
he could reach, and he
started to throw up.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:84%
He started to
vomit on the table.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:84%
The manager of the
restaurant called 911.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
They got him hauled
away in an ambulance

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.070 align:middle line:90%
almost immediately, right away.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And he turned out
to be totally fine.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.710 align:middle line:84%
They released him from the
hospital the very next day.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, me
inside that bathroom, I

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:84%
myself start to vomit while
I'm passed out on my back.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is when you
vomit on your back like that,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:90%
you aspirate, you suffocate.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened to me.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I died right there and
then on the bathroom floor.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:90%
I suffocated.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And about 45 minutes later,
the manager of the restaurant

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.920 align:middle line:84%
finally opened up that
bathroom after a customer kept

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:90%
asking him to open it for him.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:84%
He opened it and sees this
dead body on the ground.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:90%
He called 911.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And from my point of
view, I went directly

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
from consciousness
to feeling dizziness

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:84%
as if the room is
spinning on me.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And then out of
nowhere, I'm just

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.510 align:middle line:84%
watching this scene
unfold in front of me.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching a dead
body on the ground.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm watching a manager call 911.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm watching even
the customer asking

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to have the manager
open the door.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
weird and odd to me

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
because I can hear every
thought in anyone's head

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:90%
that is near me.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching
everything from above,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:90%
which was also very odd to me.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't dawn on me that
this dead body I was seeing

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:84%
was me because the body
didn't look like me.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:84%
The neck had actually already
swollen wider than the jaw.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.910 align:middle line:84%
There was very, very pallid
purple and yellow tones

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.910 align:middle line:90%
on the skin.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It didn't look-- it
almost didn't look human.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think for a
second that that was me

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
because me was up here
watching what was going on.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I watched them bag this body
when the ambulance comes.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:90%
They pronounce it dead.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:90%
They put it in a body bag.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
They put it on a
gurney and they put it

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:90%
in the back of the ambulance.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the other
medics, there's

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:90%
three medics that show up.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a rookie
who's brand new.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.920 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting in the
back with the body.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:10%
The other two are out
getting paperwork done.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel his
dismay because he felt

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:90%
like I wanted to be a medic.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be an EMT
to make a difference.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that he wasn't
making that difference.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.010 align:middle line:84%
He felt that these veteran
medics didn't try for very long

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.550 align:middle line:90%
to resuscitate the body.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:84%
He felt they should have
tried for 20 minutes, not just

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.019 align:middle line:90%
5 minutes.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
down the street.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
As they pull away
from the scene,

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:90%
I see this glow start to form.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And it really looked like
a little miniature sun

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
starting to glow in the
heart space on the rookie

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
medic who's sitting in
the back of the ambulance.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I see it start to glow and
it got brighter and brighter.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard very
loudly, this one's not dead.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know where that came
from, but I definitely heard it.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell that the
rookie medic heard it too.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:90%
Now, he froze.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle line:10%
He kind of froze as
soon as that was said,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:10%
but he didn't do
anything about it.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I could hear him
shrugging it off

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle line:84%
as that must have just
been your imagination.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:84%
But they went another block down
the road and the light started

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:90%
to glow even brighter.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And I heard for a second
time, this one's not dead.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And on that second
time, he responded.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:90%
He reacted.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:90%
He unzipped the body bag.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
He undid a couple of
straps around the body

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:84%
so that he could reach
in and feel around

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:90%
the neck area for a pulse.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:84%
He didn't feel a pulse,
but it didn't stop him.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:90%
He kept going.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:84%
He was going to
attempt resuscitation.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So he forced oxygen
into the lungs.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
He hooked up the body
to a defibrillator.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, the alarm is going
off and the other two medics

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:84%
start just yelling
at him, saying,

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get fired.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:90%
You've got to stop this.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:90%
Stop what you're doing.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:90%
You're desecrating a dead body.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:90%
This is illegal.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.790 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't care.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.270 align:middle line:84%
He went ahead and let
the first charge happen

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and nothing happened
after the first charge.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
He went ahead and let it
recharge for a second time

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and they were still
chewing him out.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.660 align:middle line:84%
But when the second
charge happened,

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.640 align:middle line:90%
there was one single heartbeat.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:84%
It allowed the other two
medics to wait and watch.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:84%
They knew he was going
to go for a third round.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And right after, within
seconds of that third charge,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.830 align:middle line:84%
there was a steady
but faint heartbeat.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So the team began
resuscitation, procedures

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
of injecting things, and
doing all sorts of things

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:90%
for the body.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:84%
But the body was having a really
hard time with coming back.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.840 align:middle line:84%
It was going into
seizures and they

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:90%
were strapping the body down.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I was watching the
strapping going on.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel anything until
they got to the left arm.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But when they strapped
the left arm--

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm left handed-- I felt
them strapping my left arm.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And this was the first
inkling, the first idea

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that what I'd been
watching this whole time

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:90%
was my very own death.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I was working as a nurse
and I really loved my work.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I knew that was my calling when
I was a little girl, taking care

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
of other people,
especially people

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.420 align:middle line:90%
who were very sick or dying.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And I worked in critical
care until I got hurt.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I got beat up by a patient
and that ended my career.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So I had to have spinal
surgery and have two disks

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.990 align:middle line:84%
fused and hardware put in
to hold my spine together.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was at home
recovering from that.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I was hanging out with my
daughter, making smoothies,

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:90%
and I started to feel odd.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.390 align:middle line:84%
My heart started
racing out of nowhere

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not an anxious person.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:90%
And my mouth started itching.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:84%
I started having
trouble swallowing.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
I'm having some kind

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:84%
of serious allergic
reaction and I could

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:90%
tell it was moving quickly.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to itch
and break out in hives.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And I had EpiPens on hand
for a shellfish allergy

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'd never, ever
had to use them.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:90%
So I gave myself the injection.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.470 align:middle line:90%
My son drove me to the hospital.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:10%
I walked up to the
counter and the nurse that

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:10%
was standing there just
was not the nurse you would

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:10%
want to have if you were having
a life-threatening emergency.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking up because
I couldn't breathe very well

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and anaphylaxis is
all I could say.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, did
you take your EpiPen?

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.720 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, if you
took your EpiPen, why did

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:90%
you come to the emergency room?

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, oh, man,
I'm going to die today.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:10%
She said, we have a room, but
we don't have a bed in it.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And I can't put you in
a room without a bed.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't need a bed.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:90%
I need help.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So she put me in the
wheelchair and she wheeled me

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:84%
back down that hallway
and it's a dead end.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting back in this
hallway knowing no one can see

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:84%
me and that I'm-- there's no
way I could get up and walk

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:84%
because I'm having so
much trouble breathing.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to get
someone's attention.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.370 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't working.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I had developed
stridor at that point,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:84%
which is a noise your throat
makes as it's swelling shut.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So the stridor got
louder and louder.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.220 align:middle line:90%
And I saw this--

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
physician's assistant

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.892 align:middle line:84%
stick her head around the corner
and she said, oh, my gosh.

00:08:52.892 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And she came running down the
hall, grabbed the wheelchair,

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:84%
ran down the hall with it, and
we get over to the trauma room.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:90%
My blood pressure was dropping.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So they started giving me
IV epinephrine, Benadryl.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:84%
My husband, my
fiancé at the time,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.250 align:middle line:84%
gets there and
walks into the room.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting in
the bed straight up,

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.840 align:middle line:84%
looking straight up, and you
can just hear this whistling.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at the doctor and
said, if you don't do something,

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.390 align:middle line:90%
she's going to stop breathing.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, no, no,
we've got plenty of time

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:90%
before that happens.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And by my husband's telling,
it's less than five minutes

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:90%
and I just collapse.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.610 align:middle line:84%
But I immediately popped out of
my body and was over the top,

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:90%
in the corner watching.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:90%
And I heard the code call.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.935 align:middle line:84%
I thought, uh-oh,
somebody's in trouble.

00:09:37.935 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody came
running into the room

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, oh, it's
that lady in the bed.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know who she was.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So they all came in and
started to work on me.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.240 align:middle line:90%
They code me.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I hear the tongue blade
snap and I go out.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And the next time I wake
up, I'm in my sister's car.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:90%
She's driving down the road.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
She's coming from
Wisconsin to Kentucky

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:90%
to be with me and the kids.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's pouring rain.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It's dark out.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell
something wasn't right.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't feel the seat
against my legs or my back.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like I
had any density at all.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't say
anything because I

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to scare her.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered
where she was going.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Is something wrong
with the kids?

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Did something happen
to her husband?

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Why is she out in this horrible
weather, in the dark driving?

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And she pulls over in this
gas station under the canopy

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:90%
and she pulls out her phone.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And she types in,
hang on, kiddo.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Then I go unconscious again,
and I wake up in this dark void.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I was born in Salem, Oregon,
then ended up moving down

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:45.370 align:middle line:84%
to Santa Barbara when I
was about 26, 27 years old.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I had met someone up in Oregon
and we married down here.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, that
person didn't really

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
show me who he was
before he brought me down

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to Santa Barbara, far
away from my family.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I started seeing
his real behaviors,

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:90%
which were very abusive.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:10%
And I was alarmed
and scared and didn't

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:10%
want to tell anybody that I
had moved to Santa Barbara

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:10%
and that this person was hurting
me, and hitting me, and really

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:10%
controlling everything I did.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:10%
And so by the time that
1987 rolled around,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:10%
I had a little baby daughter
that was about five months old

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:10%
and a son that was
about eight years old.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:84%
But my now ex-husband
had hurt my back.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I had gone into doctors
and had an evaluation.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors decided
to do surgery on my back.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.760 align:middle line:90%
So it was December of 1987.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I was in the hospital
in Santa Barbara

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.940 align:middle line:84%
the night before the surgery
to have a myelogram done.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:10%
The myelogram is where
they inject iodine dye

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:10%
in my spinal cord.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Then they were supposed
to tip the table

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.190 align:middle line:84%
so that my dye that they'd
injected behind my neck

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
would roll through my
spinal cord down my spine.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And they could then see if when
I blew the disk out on my back,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
if it had chipped
the spinal cord.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So they had me on the X-ray
table and they injected the dye.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:90%
It was just normal procedure.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.540 align:middle line:90%
This isn't a big deal.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
the X-ray tech

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:84%
that was pushing the
button on the X-ray table

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.400 align:middle line:84%
began talking to the other X-ray
tech about their weekend plans,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and he pushed the wrong
button on the X-ray table.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So that instead of moving the
table so that my head was moved

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:84%
upwards, it was instead
tipping the opposite way

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
so that my head
was being lowered

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:90%
and my feet were being raised.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And that caused the
dye that they had just

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:84%
injected into the back of my
neck to flow into my brain.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And so within 30s, I started
feeling really weird.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was really paying
any attention to me.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of laying
on the table going,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I should
say something.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.955 align:middle line:90%
I feel really weird.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm going to faint.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.100 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And so by the time that I
wanted to finally interrupt

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:84%
the two guys that
were the X-ray techs,

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:90%
I actually couldn't speak.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.050 align:middle line:90%
And that panicked me.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't reach my hand out
to touch either one of them.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get my body
to respond to what

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:90%
was happening in my brain.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.530 align:middle line:90%
So I started hyperventilating.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I was breathing
loudly and very fast.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:84%
The X-ray techs realized
that they stopped talking

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and looked at me,
and my eyes were

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:90%
rolling to the back of my head.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.880 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't keep my eyes forward.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:84%
The X-ray tech
looked at my face,

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and then he leaned
back to see where

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:90%
his finger was on the machine.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And that point, he
made a face like--

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS]

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I was not in
my body any longer.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I was gone out of it and
I was up on the ceiling.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:84%
All of the panic and
the scaredness was gone.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:90%
I felt completely calm.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down and
I said, if I'm up here,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and my body is down there, and
that man is calling code blue,

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.060 align:middle line:90%
then I think I just died.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> This is when I went to
essentially the darkest place

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:90%
I've ever gone in my life.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I had such an ego voice going,
saying, you're such an idiot.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.900 align:middle line:84%
How could you not
know that what you've

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
been watching this whole
time was your own death?

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:90%
How could you not know that?

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to feel
that and think that,

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I then started to see
in very quick flashes

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:84%
all the negative
influences I had

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.850 align:middle line:84%
on other people
in my whole life.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:84%
The things that I
did to hurt people

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:84%
on accident or on purpose, I
saw it not just through my eyes

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
but through their eyes,
how it impacted them.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I started to feel this
voice coming out of me saying,

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:90%
you're not worth saving.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Look at all this bad that
you've done in your life.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a sudden,
in the same speed,

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.810 align:middle line:84%
I started to see all
the good that I did.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot more good
than I had ever done, way more.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And I saw how much change
I was able to impact

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.990 align:middle line:90%
people's lives in good ways.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And this love started to
pour over me from behind me.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's so hard to
describe in words

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's a love
that we don't have here.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:84%
It's an unconditional,
pure love that

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exist in this
space, at least that we can

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:90%
really, really feel like there.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:90%
And this love poured over me.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And this love, it had such
a profound effect on me.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I had a pretty rough upbringing.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I had some darkness
inside of me.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And this love flushed it out,
sealed it up, made it whole.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And all of this
is happening, I'm

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.910 align:middle line:84%
realizing that all of this love
and this light and this energy

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:90%
is coming from behind me.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And I can see a man
standing behind me

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.590 align:middle line:84%
with very pink skin,
very long white beard.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:90%
He has long white hair.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:90%
His eyes could pierce you.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.855 align:middle line:84%
They could look through you
and they could essentially

00:16:27.855 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:84%
know not who you thought you
were, but who you really were.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And my first thought
was, are you God?

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:90%
And this gentleman just laughed.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, I'm not God.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Then my follow up question
was must be Jesus then.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Even though you don't look
like Jesus, you must be Jesus.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And he laughed at that as well
and said, no, son, I'm not

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Jesus, but I'm here for you.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to be your guide.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to help you go
wherever you want to go.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me, he motioned,
I could go back to my life

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:90%
or I could go forward with him.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.839 align:middle line:84%
And he could show me
what's next for me, what's

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:90%
next in line for my life.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I didn't
want to go back to the body.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:20.530 align:middle line:84%
There was no question because
the body to me meant mistakes.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:90%
It meant failures.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.800 align:middle line:90%
It meant pain.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:90%
It meant struggle.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And so far, everything that
I've felt from this gentleman

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:84%
was absolute peace,
unconditional love,

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and energy and power
that was coming from him.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted that.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:90%
I wanted more of that.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that was,
that's what I wanted.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So I told him, I
want to go with you.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you're going,
that's where I want to go.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And he explained to me that we
were going to start a journey.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
This journey was going to be
from a lower understanding

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and a lower density to a much
higher frequency and a much

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.050 align:middle line:90%
higher understanding.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:84%
That we weren't just going to
travel from space to space,

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to travel
from dimension to dimension,

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.820 align:middle line:84%
from low dimension
to high dimension.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And as we're doing that, I
had to raise my frequency.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I had to raise my
dimensional vibration

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
to be able to match his
to keep going with him.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I had to fully embrace
these major principles

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to get where we
were going to go.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I would have thought that the
first principle was going to be

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:90%
love, but it wasn't.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:84%
The first principle
was authenticity.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:84%
That I had to realize
that all of us

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:90%
are not authentic in this world.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:84%
That the most authentic
people in our world,

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.630 align:middle line:84%
in this earthly life, are the
very young and the very old

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.180 align:middle line:84%
is because they have
nothing to lose and nothing

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:90%
to gain by being inauthentic.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And he explained to me
that through this life

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.940 align:middle line:84%
we put different facades
on the outside of us.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:84%
We put different masks
on for different people,

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and that I needed
to get to a point

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
where I could be the same person
no matter who I was around.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually
quite hard for me.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize that I
had put on so many masks.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And he helped me one at a
time, peel those all away

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and start building cleanly
on a new foundation.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he
did with authenticity.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Then he brought me to
understand the purpose

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:90%
of life, why we come here.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I was taught something
very different in my church

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:90%
and in my upbringing.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I was taught more that
we're here to be proven

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:90%
and to be tested.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:84%
But it was very clear
that our life here is not

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:90%
a courtroom, but a classroom.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
That we're here to learn
to grow, to exercise

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:90%
the power of creation.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And that as we existed
in heaven before here,

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:02.370 align:middle line:84%
anything God wanted,
we wanted instantly.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And that for us to really
grow is just like Earth.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:84%
We had to leave home
and it was scary.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:84%
We had to go through a
veil of forgetfulness.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Because that love is so
strong and so powerful

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:84%
that even the
remembrance of that love

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
would prevent us from
having true free agency.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:84%
We would still be
making decisions

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:84%
out of obligation of that
love because, again, that love

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:90%
is so powerful.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
important things I learned

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:90%
was to master my thoughts.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Because truly, our
thoughts themselves create.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:90%
They end up becoming who we are.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.730 align:middle line:84%
They become our character
and where we go in our life.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important for us
to come from an energy of love

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.910 align:middle line:84%
with our thinking, especially
when we think about ourselves.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:01.020 align:middle line:84%
It amplifies whatever we
desire that we want to create.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And that brought me
all the way to where

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.430 align:middle line:90%
I was seeing this vast planet.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was surrounded by this
almost like a cloud mist.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But what was odd to
me, as I looked around,

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.200 align:middle line:90%
and I could not see a sun.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was led to know
through my guide.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:90%
His name is Drake.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Drake led me to know that this
space was lit from within.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So the light in this
space of heaven,

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:32.610 align:middle line:90%
it comes from within everything.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.800 align:middle line:84%
That's why there
there's so many colors

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:84%
we don't have here because
the actual existence of light

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:90%
is different.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.243 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
glows there, everything.

00:21:43.243 --> 00:21:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I say glow,
I don't mean, like,

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:49.120 align:middle line:84%
glow in the dark glow, I
mean glow like our sun glows.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And to even bring a single blade
of grass here to our Earth,

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
it would explode it because
there's so much energy

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:84%
in a single blade
of grass there.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're at such a low density
here that we couldn't vibrate

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:90%
at that such high frequency.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.680 align:middle line:84%
We would be incinerated
just to bring that here.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why there is this
tunnel or this journey

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
go through for us

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
to get to heaven is we have to
really ramp up our frequency

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:90%
to be able to get there.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:90%
And as I did, I touched down.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:90%
I got into heaven.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.600 align:middle line:90%
I got to feel the grass.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, the grass was
the most beautiful thing

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I'd ever seen in my
entire existence.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:38.320 align:middle line:84%
The grass had a distinct, loving
music frequency coming from it.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Just to even be
near it, you would

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.040 align:middle line:84%
feel connected to
everything in heaven.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I was in this
really dark place,

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
like the darkest place
you've ever seen.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, whoa,
what has happened?

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see
anything around me.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.030 align:middle line:90%
And so I started speculating.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe I
never really existed.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I've always been here,
and I just made that stuff up

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:84%
about the kids and the life
so that I would have something

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.185 align:middle line:84%
to think about to keep
me from going crazy here.

00:23:10.185 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I've thought
about it for so long I

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.600 align:middle line:90%
think it's real now.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I did something terrible
and I've been cast out.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in this
place as a punishment

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just never
going to get to leave.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just couldn't figure out
where I was or why I was there.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think I need to
try harder to move.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's some trick to it.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I leaned forward
kind of like this.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And as I leaned
forward, I started

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:84%
moving the direction that I'd
leaned forward and I thought,

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.610 align:middle line:90%
oh, my gosh, I can move.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked off to my left
and I could see very faint light

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:90%
in that direction.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So I get over to
where the light is,

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell it's coming from
the other side of this divide.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.580 align:middle line:10%
And the divide looked
like thick glass blocks.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.407 align:middle line:84%
They used to make these leaded
glass blocks for showers.

00:24:01.407 --> 00:24:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So you could see
someone was in there,

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:84%
but you couldn't
see their features.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it looked like.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So I took my head and I kept
looking closer and closer

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.462 align:middle line:90%
until my nose touched the glass.

00:24:11.462 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And when my nose
touched the glass,

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I could see the room
on the other side.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:90%
And there I was, lying in a bed.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.030 align:middle line:84%
My wrists were
restrained to the bed.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:90%
I was completely unconscious.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the monitor
settings on the monitors

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that they had going and
could tell that I was

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:90%
stable but obviously critical.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So I knew I was in
an induced coma.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And in front of the ventilator,
my daughter is standing.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
She's got a flannel shirt on
and I knew the time of year.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why is she
wearing a flannel shirt

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.700 align:middle line:90%
in August.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.320 align:middle line:90%
That looks so hot.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter has
always been really stoic,

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
not prone to drama, very
rational, pragmatic.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And you just never
really know what's

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.210 align:middle line:84%
going on inside her emotionally
because she's just not

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.530 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, I felt
like I had gone into her

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel
what she was feeling

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:90%
for the first time in my life.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
She was terrified and
it just broke my heart

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:90%
that she was scared.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.058 align:middle line:90%
And so I popped through.

00:25:10.058 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was like when I
was in the emergency room,

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:90%
I was above myself watching.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I kind of thought when I popped
through that I would go back

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:84%
in my body, and I would
wake up, and I didn't.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered, maybe I need
to get lower, and get over

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.420 align:middle line:84%
the top of me, and I'll get
sucked back in like a sponge.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.350 align:middle line:90%
So I tried that.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.420 align:middle line:90%
That didn't work.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I get really frustrated.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I get sucked back, but just on
the other side of the bubble.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.370 align:middle line:90%
So I'm in the dark void.

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.150 align:middle line:90%
I was crying and yelling at God.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what is going on?

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.180 align:middle line:90%
What is wrong with you?

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.390 align:middle line:90%
How did I get here?

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.280 align:middle line:90%
How do I fix this?

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And it just occurred to
me like an epiphany--

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.750 align:middle line:90%
God didn't put me in that place.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:90%
I made that place.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I realized
it, there was a crack

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and I could hear this
loud, resonant cracking,

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.883 align:middle line:84%
like when the ice starts to
thaw in the lakes in Michigan.

00:26:03.883 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear a crack
start and then

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.530 align:middle line:84%
you'll hear it go all
the way out and echo.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.905 align:middle line:90%
And I heard that crack.

00:26:08.905 --> 00:26:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And as it started
to crack, light

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.740 align:middle line:84%
started pouring
through the cracks.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And this being, this
spirit comes from where

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:90%
one of the openings is.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:84%
She's huge in not just stature,
but in a grand sort of way

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:90%
her spirit was huge.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.075 align:middle line:84%
And as she gets close to me,
she draws me into her arms.

00:26:28.075 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't touch
me or anything,

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:90%
but I'm pulled into her arms.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And all these little
shards of the darkness

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:35.430 align:middle line:90%
are coming toward us.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And her energy is
swirling around us.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And as the shards would
hit that swirling energy,

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:90%
they would explode.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And they'd be cast
off and gone forever.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And that little bit of
darkness would be gone.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So she's holding
me and I'm crying.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And she says, calm
yourself, dear one.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And I start trying to
figure out who she is.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Her eyes are very familiar, just
this blue, green, beautiful,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:90%
beautiful eyes.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And I look up and on her
head is this orange hair

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.980 align:middle line:90%
and it looks like flames.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And I knew immediately it was
my grandmother, my mom's mom.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.390 align:middle line:10%
I was just astonished.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:84%
She had died when I was
nine and there she was.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up at her
and I said, oh, my gosh, I

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.000 align:middle line:90%
thought you died.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, no and we're
just speaking telepathically

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.030 align:middle line:90%
to each other.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:26.280 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, no, no, dear
one, there's no death.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.950 align:middle line:84%
You're either alive on the Earth
side or you're super alive here.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And she said, with you,
you're kind of both.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.145 align:middle line:84%
There's a cord that is attaching
you still to your body.

00:27:36.145 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you decide
you're going to stay,

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.280 align:middle line:90%
that cord will be broken.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you decide
you're going to go,

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:84%
then you'll go
back to your body.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And the choice is yours.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't understand.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.180 align:middle line:90%
How am I not dead?

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.520 align:middle line:90%
She said, there's no death.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:90%
You know this.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:90%
You learned this.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
When you were little
in primary school,

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.050 align:middle line:84%
you were taught that energy
isn't created or destroyed,

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:90%
it just changes form.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.600 align:middle line:84%
That's God's law
borrowed by man.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
such a shock to me.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:84%
How could I have ever doubted
that there was an afterlife?

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I believed in
God and everything,

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:13.960 align:middle line:84%
but as a fail-safe
in case I died.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.270 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know if
there was an afterlife.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:90%
I hoped there would be.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.670 align:middle line:84%
But what she said scientifically
and my nurse brain

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.410 align:middle line:90%
made perfect sense.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm there with
her in her arms

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and just basking
in the glow of it.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:90%
And I realized that she's gone.

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:84%
But I start hearing
this thundering.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.010 align:middle line:90%
It was shaking everything.

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that all the
things that had ever existed

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.250 align:middle line:84%
were shaking, and all the
things that were yet to exist

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:90%
were shaking.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, no, it's God.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.220 align:middle line:90%
And that was my exact reaction.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.472 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, my
gosh, think of something

00:28:49.472 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:84%
good you've done, because
I knew my grandmother could

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.480 align:middle line:90%
read my mind.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And if she could read
my mind, so could he.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And so he gets
closer and closer.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And as he gets right
there in my presence,

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.690 align:middle line:90%
there's this brilliant glow.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.322 align:middle line:84%
And it was so strange because
it didn't feel uncomfortable.

00:29:04.322 --> 00:29:06.530 align:middle line:84%
As bright as the light was,
you would think it would.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.240 align:middle line:90%
It was like looking at the sun.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And so when he gets in
close to my presence,

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.750 align:middle line:84%
he says in this
thunderous voice, I am.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And my immediate comedic
brain thought, yeah, you are.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:90%
I was just blown away by--

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had better
words to put to it.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:84%
But to be in that spot with the
known creator of the universe

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:90%
and he knew me.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:34.090 align:middle line:90%
So he starts to show me my life.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And so he starts
with something good.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was the smallest thing
that I didn't even remember

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.320 align:middle line:90%
until he showed it to me.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in this little grocery
store in this little town

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.790 align:middle line:90%
that we lived in.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.922 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lady
in front of me

00:29:46.922 --> 00:29:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and she doesn't have enough
money to pay for her groceries.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And she's just short
$0.70 some cents under $1.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.800 align:middle line:84%
She starts trying to figure out
what she's going to put back

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and she's choosing
something that is obviously

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.370 align:middle line:90%
for her and not for her kids.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, man, I
remember how humiliating

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:84%
this feels because I was a
single mom of three kids.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Their dad abandoned us when
my oldest child was five.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember that feeling
of counting up change, going

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:16.268 align:middle line:84%
to the grocery store,
trying to make sure

00:30:16.268 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't go over
because I didn't want

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.220 align:middle line:84%
to be humiliated in the checkout
and have to put something back.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And there she was,
red and embarrassed.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hang on, hang on,
please don't put anything back.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.840 align:middle line:90%
Let me help.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.980 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I took the change out
of my purse and gave it to her.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.340 align:middle line:90%
And she left.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.728 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, gosh, of all
the good things I've done.

00:30:35.728 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've worked as a nurse.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.116 align:middle line:90%
I've saved people's lives.

00:30:39.116 --> 00:30:41.250 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing you've picked?

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.060 align:middle line:90%
And he said, let me show you.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And so he pans that scene
way forward into the future

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and I see her working
in this food pantry.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.640 align:middle line:84%
She's working
behind the counter.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:84%
There's shelves and all the
food is ordered on the shelves.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And this woman walks in
and she said, I need help.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And you could tell she was
humiliated to ask for it.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And the lady that I had
helped said to her, it's OK,

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.250 align:middle line:90%
don't be embarrassed.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.130 align:middle line:90%
I've been where you are.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
oh, my gosh, I had

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:84%
no idea how profound
the ripple effect is

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.620 align:middle line:90%
of even small acts of kindness.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, maybe those
are the most important.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.190 align:middle line:90%
And we went to this next scene.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And in that scene,
there was a woman

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:84%
there that I had worked
with that I always

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:29.880 align:middle line:84%
hated working with because
I felt like she was

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:90%
inattentive with her patients.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So I was always
frustrated with her.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And God showed me,
he said, you've

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:38.970 align:middle line:84%
harbored resentment
toward her in your heart.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And your thoughts have energy,
your words have more energy,

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.070 align:middle line:90%
actions even more so.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.860 align:middle line:84%
But it all starts
with a thought.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said instead
of engaging with her,

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.200 align:middle line:84%
and encouraging her,
and trying to help

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:84%
her grow into a
better nurse, you just

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:90%
held a grudge toward her.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it harder for
her to change who she is.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me her life
and he showed me the things

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.030 align:middle line:84%
that her father had done to
her when she was a little girl.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And just the abuse and
how her coping skills

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.400 align:middle line:90%
had hurt her through her life.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, my
gosh, she is so much

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.560 align:middle line:90%
better than who she was.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.920 align:middle line:90%
She's come out of that.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.290 align:middle line:90%
She is doing something selfless.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:84%
She's not doing it to her
highest potential yet,

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.250 align:middle line:90%
but she's trying.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And here I slowed that
down just by thinking

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.550 align:middle line:84%
these negative
thoughts toward her.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.390 align:middle line:90%
And so he shows me all of that.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And I get this sense that
I have to make a choice

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.290 align:middle line:90%
to go further with this.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if I
wanted to do that.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I got
suddenly ire in me.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I was angry and it felt like God
was asking me to do something

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.520 align:middle line:90%
to reveal this part of me.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like he
hadn't been true to me.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:53.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know what?

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.310 align:middle line:90%
You say you love us.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.220 align:middle line:90%
You say you want our good.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But where were you when my
kids' dad abandoned them?

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Where were you when
Jacob would walk out

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.860 align:middle line:84%
to the mailbox day
after day after day

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to look for something
that his dad promised him

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:90%
that was never going to come?

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.350 align:middle line:90%
I can understand my suffering.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.900 align:middle line:90%
I made a bad marriage choice.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.000 align:middle line:84%
But these were
innocent children.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.700 align:middle line:10%
And he said, oh, my
goodness, dear one, you've

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.810 align:middle line:10%
completely misunderstood me.

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you something.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So this movie thing opens back
up and I can see my oldest son.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.500 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting, looking
down on a soccer field.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting next to
him and my grandson, who

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.270 align:middle line:90%
was two at the time.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.190 align:middle line:90%
But in this image, he's five.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:38.010 align:middle line:84%
He's running up and down
the field and he's so tan.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.160 align:middle line:84%
The sun's on him, and
it's shining off his hair,

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and he's so alive.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And he says, mom,
I'm going to be

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.160 align:middle line:90%
the dad to him that I deserved.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:90%
And it still chokes me up.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
my goodness, you're

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.400 align:middle line:84%
breaking the cycle
of abandonment,

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.490 align:middle line:84%
of fatherless children
with my generation.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.650 align:middle line:84%
If that was the purpose
for all of this,

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:04.077 align:middle line:84%
was to finally break
that chain, OK, we're

00:34:04.077 --> 00:34:05.660 align:middle line:84%
willing to take one
for the team there

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.770 align:middle line:84%
for all the future
generations that will come.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And this light comes
off him in a stream

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.449 align:middle line:84%
and it starts swirling
around like this healing

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:15.860 align:middle line:90%
cloak inside me.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through and
orders and corrects so many

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:22.400 align:middle line:84%
of those visceral pains
I had had through life.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.989 align:middle line:90%
And there was so much.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:25.679 align:middle line:90%
That marriage fell apart on me.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was a huge shock
to me that it did.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And on that day, I
started stacking bricks.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And every time I would get
hurt, I would stack a brick.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And then something
else would happen

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.739 align:middle line:90%
and I would stack a brick.

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had done that over so long
that I had built my own jail.

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:43.760 align:middle line:84%
That was the place,
the void that I was

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.540 align:middle line:90%
experiencing on the other side.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It was this prison of my own
design, and I was my own jailer.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was too fearful to get
hurt again, to let myself out.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:58.020 align:middle line:84%
But I was hurting so
badly in that jail.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:10%
I may have been what I thought
was safe, but I wasn't.

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:10%
I was dying inside.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So we're in this place and
I'm realizing what I've built.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And this light is in me
and it's healing so many

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.980 align:middle line:90%
of those deep, visceral wounds.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And it goes up and it
wraps around my heart.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:90%
And I just felt so loved.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.677 align:middle line:90%
And I knew everything.

00:35:17.677 --> 00:35:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I knew I wasn't going
to be able to keep it,

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:21.630 align:middle line:90%
but everything came to light.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything that had been
shadowed was now revealed.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt this wonderful
presence that was right next

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:30.610 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like I had known
it forever beyond my life,

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.760 align:middle line:90%
prior to my life.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It felt like what I
would think God was.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And I felt this connection to
that presence that lasted longer

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.080 align:middle line:90%
than my whole entire life.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.720 align:middle line:90%
He'd always been with me.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And there were lots of
times in those instances

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
as I was growing up, that I
felt his presence as well.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.720 align:middle line:84%
There was times when
I had my life saved.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
that was him doing that.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And so up on the
ceiling, it felt

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.950 align:middle line:84%
the same, the love
and the presence

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and the acceptance
and the warmth.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.727 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't question who it was.

00:36:12.727 --> 00:36:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even look
to see if there was

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:90%
a light or anything next to me.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I knew who it was and I was
watching everything down below.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I began talking
not with my mouth,

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.890 align:middle line:84%
obviously because I
wasn't in my body.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But with my thoughts, I
ended up saying to him,

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I really would like to
go back into my life.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.370 align:middle line:10%
Because if I leave my
children in this way,

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:39.340 align:middle line:10%
in this situation that I'm
married to this person who's

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:10%
abusive, they won't grow up
to be the good human beings

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.240 align:middle line:10%
that they're capable of being.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.300 align:middle line:10%
I need to go back into my body.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:51.190 align:middle line:10%
And so I was saying that
very gently, not demanding.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:52.640 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't scary.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.810 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely
beautiful in the presence

00:36:55.810 --> 00:37:01.480 align:middle line:84%
of feeling so loved, and
so cherished, and accepted

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.520 align:middle line:90%
by this beautiful being.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.780 align:middle line:84%
But I was looking straight
down at my body and everything

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.190 align:middle line:90%
down below was panic mode.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.160 align:middle line:84%
The doctors panicked
the second that they

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.740 align:middle line:90%
realized that I had just died.

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.040 align:middle line:84%
The X-ray techs
started doing CPR.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.770 align:middle line:84%
The woman who was in the
room got on the telephone,

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:24.020 align:middle line:84%
was calling for a defib
unit screaming stat.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And all this melee was going
on down below, which actually

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.928 align:middle line:90%
seemed pretty obnoxious.

00:37:29.928 --> 00:37:32.470 align:middle line:84%
They stopped blowing in my mouth
and they put the oxygen mask

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:33.310 align:middle line:90%
over my face.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And they were still doing
the chest compressions.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And then another person
came in and he had a box.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And he started peeling
these little white things

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and he was putting
them on my chest.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.600 align:middle line:84%
He turned on the heart
monitor, which was

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.710 align:middle line:90%
what he was connecting me to.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And then this little white
light came and went right

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
across the screen, and it was
just staying in a flat line.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized,
oh, that's a heart monitor

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.390 align:middle line:90%
and that's my flat line.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So I actually saw that
from up on the ceiling.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I watched that and
listened to it going beep.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that I had
no heart activity.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And the neurosurgeon said to
the orthopedic surgeon, too

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:14.202 align:middle line:90%
much time has passed.

00:38:14.202 --> 00:38:15.410 align:middle line:90%
She's going to be brain dead.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:16.780 align:middle line:90%
We need to do something.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:20.588 align:middle line:84%
And so the orthopedic
surgeon said, stand clear.

00:38:20.588 --> 00:38:22.630 align:middle line:84%
The people that were around
the head of the table

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.860 align:middle line:90%
stepped backwards.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And he took two steps
forwards and he took his fist

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:30.280 align:middle line:84%
from behind his back and he just
pounded the center of my chest.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I watched
that from up above.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.860 align:middle line:90%
I watched my body react to that.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.800 align:middle line:84%
But right when that
happened, the being

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.990 align:middle line:84%
who I'd been talking to
finally spoke to me and said,

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:49.510 align:middle line:84%
but if you go back, you'll
still be in your marriage.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.600 align:middle line:90%
What will you do?

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It was such a
beautiful experience.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm literally
glowing in this space,

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling the connectedness of
the grass, and all the plants,

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and the water, and the
healing power of this water.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:10.570 align:middle line:84%
When my guide, Drake, he
pulls me aside and he says,

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Vinney, this is going
to be very hard,

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.970 align:middle line:90%
but it's going to be worth it.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And out of nowhere, I start
hearing my brother's voice.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.920 align:middle line:84%
My brother from Earth,
I hear his voice

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.650 align:middle line:84%
as loud as he is
speaking in my own ear.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And I hear him giving
a special prayer.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, meanwhile,
I've been in a coma.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I've been brain
dead for three days.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.250 align:middle line:10%
And my brother is
standing over my body

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:40.370 align:middle line:10%
and giving me a love that I
didn't know he had for me,

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.910 align:middle line:10%
as he said this prayer over me.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:47.480 align:middle line:10%
And he finished
with the sentence,

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.720 align:middle line:10%
I bless you to be made whole.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Here I was in heaven.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.260 align:middle line:90%
I finally felt whole.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.840 align:middle line:84%
But this blessing
to make me whole,

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.500 align:middle line:84%
it actually tore
me away from there.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And right before
I was taken away,

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I got this amazing
hug from Drake.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:84%
I got to feel and
understand the cosmos.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I got to feel and understand
what all of this means,

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.530 align:middle line:84%
why we're here, why there's
time, why there's struggle.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:19.740 align:middle line:90%
I learned it all.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:26.000 align:middle line:10%
And I was just poured love,
love that I never deserved,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.770 align:middle line:10%
love that I still strive
to be worthy of today.

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a
pristine experience

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:38.240 align:middle line:84%
to feel that power, such
a power that I didn't know

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.210 align:middle line:90%
existed in all the cosmos.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And then I was forced back.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I
remember, I woke up.

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I woke up out of a three-day
coma, being brain dead.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I pulled every tube off of
me, every sensor off of me.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.420 align:middle line:90%
I felt so confined.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
felt so confined

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:03.330 align:middle line:84%
is, is who we really are is
much larger than this form.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So I woke up at
1:11 in the morning.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:09.450 align:middle line:90%
I was checked out at 7:30 AM.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Even though every single
department tried to resist

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and did not want me to go, I
still signed all the waivers.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I got out of there
and I went jogging.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I actually went jogging that day
and had no problems whatsoever.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I had no residing effects
of my death other than I'm

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.370 align:middle line:90%
a different person now.

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I realized we were
going to go away.

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.330 align:middle line:84%
We were going to
go on this journey.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So we start going through
my DNA and I can see us

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.750 align:middle line:90%
going through these chromosomes.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
and going and going

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and there's this part where we
come to what's called junk DNA.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And God points to it and
he says, do you see me?

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:53.220 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm in you.

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Like your father is your father.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:58.750 align:middle line:84%
You can deny your
father is your father.

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But we can look at this code
and we can determine that he is.

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And you can deny it and
you can run away from it,

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.580 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is
he is your father.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.780 align:middle line:90%
I am your father.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.700 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in here.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, all my life
I was chasing what I thought

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.650 align:middle line:90%
was this external thing.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to
say that we are God.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm very clear
that I was not God.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:22.600 align:middle line:84%
But his fingerprints are on us
as he's knitting us together

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.900 align:middle line:84%
in our mother's womb and he
can't separate himself back out.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.940 align:middle line:90%
So he is deeply embedded there.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we're always
searching for something.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.430 align:middle line:84%
We're searching for
this missing part of us.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:36.580 align:middle line:84%
It's because we
don't realize that.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're racing through this
DNA, but we hit this wall.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.070 align:middle line:90%
We just stop.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And I knew in that
moment, I had to make

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:48.140 align:middle line:84%
a decision about whether
I was going to stay or go.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately
thought, I'm staying.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.200 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't even feel selfish.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I knew that my family would
be OK, that we would all

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.180 align:middle line:90%
end up together eventually.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.690 align:middle line:90%
And life had been hard.

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.390 align:middle line:90%
I was tired.

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:02.750 align:middle line:84%
This was the first time I'd
ever felt completely loved

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.210 align:middle line:90%
and accepted and understood.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But even as I thought the
words, I knew I couldn't do it.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I had not lived the
life I was supposed to live,

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:17.390 align:middle line:84%
that I had hid from the world,
and that I had neglected

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.460 align:middle line:84%
this incredible gift
that had been given to me

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and not made of it
what I should have.

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:23.010 align:middle line:90%
So I knew I had to go back.

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I realized
it, I started pulling away.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.950 align:middle line:84%
The light started
getting further away.

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:29.660 align:middle line:90%
And he gave me a message.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want you to share
this message with the world.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:35.342 align:middle line:84%
And it was just the most
beautiful love letter.

00:43:35.342 --> 00:43:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And as he was saying it, I
was thinking, how on Earth

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:39.350 align:middle line:90%
am I going to remember this?

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And I started to cry.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wait,
wait, wait, don't go.

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Let me remember it.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.480 align:middle line:84%
If I can't remember
it, I'll lose all hope.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.090 align:middle line:90%
And so I woke up.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:50.920 align:middle line:90%
I was in the ICU.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.840 align:middle line:84%
There was a nurse
sitting next to the bed.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.160 align:middle line:90%
My wrists were untied.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.810 align:middle line:90%
I was off of the ventilator.

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her and
I said, I was with God.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.680 align:middle line:90%
And she patted my hand.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.130 align:middle line:90%
She said, oh, that's nice, dear.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:05.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, I mean, just
now, I was with God.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, OK, well,
let me go get your family.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in a
faith-based hospital

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and they all thought
it was crazy.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And so my family comes in,
and my sister comes in.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I saw
what you wrote.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Hang on, kiddo, I'm coming.

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.922 align:middle line:90%
And she was just blown away.

00:44:21.922 --> 00:44:23.380 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know
what to do with it.

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.610 align:middle line:90%
She didn't say anything.

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:27.960 align:middle line:84%
It's caused this real
weirdness in our relationship.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the nurses
finally ran my family off

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:34.620 align:middle line:84%
because I was trying to explain
how I had been with God and all

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.980 align:middle line:90%
these things that had happened.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was
just looking at me

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.830 align:middle line:84%
like it was some
hallucination or something.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.430 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't share
it with anybody.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:45.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really do any
talks or anything initially.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it was very
difficult to get through.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt just this amazing
feeling of love and presence

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.420 align:middle line:90%
from him.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:45:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And I then saw all these
little flashes of movies

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.140 align:middle line:84%
like it was all
these incidents that

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.850 align:middle line:84%
had happened with my husband of
all the abuse situations that

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.460 align:middle line:84%
had happened over the time
that we had been married.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I had done everything from
write him letters telling him

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:19.140 align:middle line:84%
how I felt to begging him not to
hit us, not to hurt us anymore.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.090 align:middle line:90%
But he was the same person.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.290 align:middle line:90%
He hadn't changed at all.

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:27.020 align:middle line:84%
He just lured me back and then
I was back in the same situation

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.130 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that I'd
done everything I could

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and that it wasn't him
who needed to change.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.340 align:middle line:90%
It was me.

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So I said to the
being, if you let

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:45.900 align:middle line:84%
me go back, I promise you I'll
get strong enough to leave him.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And the second I
said the word him,

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.500 align:middle line:84%
the doctor did a precordial
thump, a second precordial thump

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and struck my chest
a second time.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And my eyes just shut
from up on the ceiling.

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And I opened my eyes and I had
the oxygen mask on my face.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:03.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking at the doctor.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.230 align:middle line:84%
He still had his fist
right there on my chest.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And I looked right
into his face and I

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:10.420 align:middle line:84%
said, into the oxygen
mask, what just happened?

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.540 align:middle line:90%
And the nurse leaned over me.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.970 align:middle line:84%
She had backed away from the
table, but she came forward.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:16.780 align:middle line:90%
And she said, stop, don't talk.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.160 align:middle line:90%
We need to stabilize you.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And so for like 20 minutes,
they stabilized me.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, they
took the oxygen mask off.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:27.430 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what just happened?

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I was up on the ceiling and I
could see and hear everything.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And the neurosurgeon was
standing next to the X-ray table

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.060 align:middle line:90%
and he went, oh, brother.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And that made me completely
disclose because I

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.820 align:middle line:90%
wanted to be believed.

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.480 align:middle line:84%
No, she was on the phone
calling for the defib unit,

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and that lady brought
in the oxygen cart,

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and then that man brought
in the heart monitor.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.160 align:middle line:90%
I watched myself flat lining.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And then these two
guys were doing CPR

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:57.572 align:middle line:90%
until the oxygen cart came in.

00:46:57.572 --> 00:46:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they stopped
blowing in my mouth

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and they were just doing
the chest compressions.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you said to him,
too much time has passed.

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And he stepped two steps
forward, struck my chest twice,

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.230 align:middle line:90%
and then I came back.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And all of them were
standing there like.

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And the neurosurgeon while I was
talking, clenched his fists up,

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:20.160 align:middle line:84%
pulled them up next to his
body, and then he went,

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.930 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to stand
here and listen to this.

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:24.570 align:middle line:90%
And he stormed out of the room.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:27.130 align:middle line:84%
But everybody else stood
there and listened.

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, they
put me on a gurney

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and they sent me up to my
room because I was having

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.160 align:middle line:90%
the surgery the next morning.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I would ask people
that came into my room

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.910 align:middle line:84%
to take my vitals or
something, what happened

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:41.090 align:middle line:90%
last night during my myelogram?

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:41.890 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.000 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And they would look at the chart
and they would say, I'm sorry,

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:46.173 align:middle line:90%
I don't see anything here.

00:47:46.173 --> 00:47:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, when my
now ex-husband showed up

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.780 align:middle line:84%
after the surgery, when I
told him what had happened,

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.360 align:middle line:84%
he ended up saying, well,
that couldn't have happened.

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.900 align:middle line:90%
You probably hallucinated that.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So I pretty much got
closed down and I just

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.010 align:middle line:90%
decided never to talk about it.

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:11.890 align:middle line:84%
It was as real and as clear
and vivid years later,

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:15.220 align:middle line:84%
when I would think about it,
something would remind me of it.

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And what ended up finally
opening me up to it

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:21.760 align:middle line:84%
was a nurse from the hospital
was talking to me one day

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.500 align:middle line:90%
and her mom was dying.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It was about 12 years
after I'd had the NDE.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And when I told her that I'd
had an incident happen to me

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:35.260 align:middle line:84%
that might make her feel
better about the situation

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.340 align:middle line:84%
with her mom's impending death,
I knew somehow in my heart

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:40.670 align:middle line:90%
that it would help people.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:42.920 align:middle line:90%
And so I gave her the story.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And she was the one who
told me that there's

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:47.030 align:middle line:90%
a lot of information online.

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:48.380 align:middle line:90%
You can look at it.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us nurses
see this happen

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's called a
near-death experience.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.000 align:middle line:90%
