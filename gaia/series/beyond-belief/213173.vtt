00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.660 align:middle line:10%
Carl Johan Calleman is with
us, a former cancer researcher

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.970 align:middle line:10%
who is now an author
devoted to the meaning

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:10%
of the Mayan calendar.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Carl, welcome to the program.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL JOHAN
CALLEMAN: Thank you.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Mayan calendar,
that 2012 date on December 21st,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:84%
everybody thought the
world was going to end.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.335 align:middle line:90%
What did it mean?

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:10%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, I think
it was an actual change--

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:10%
a significant change.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:52.400 align:middle line:10%
And to go back from the Maya,
they actually did write--

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:10%
and this is very amazing.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:10%
1,500 years ago, they did write
an inscription of what was going

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:10%
to happen on this
particular date.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And what it says is a little
bit mysterious, maybe.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
But what it says
is that an entity

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:84%
they called the nine storied
deity, the nine level deity,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:84%
would appear in
its full regalia.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And what I interpret
that to mean

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:84%
is that there are nine
levels of consciousness

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.335 align:middle line:84%
that are sort of inscribed
in the Mayan pyramids.

00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: And all of those
would, in principle, be active,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and I think that is
really what happened.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:84%
But it was also a complicated
change, a much more complicated

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
change than anybody
had anticipated

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
because some of these
waves would turn down

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:90%
and others would go up.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:84%
These are waves of
creation that the Maya

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:84%
would use as the basis
of their calendar system.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:90%
So I do think it was a change.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And in certain ways, I
think life has become harder

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:90%
for people after this change.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
In other ways, there are
new possibilities coming up.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you go from being

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
a cancer researcher to
an expert on the Maya

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.295 align:middle line:90%
and the Mayan calendar?

00:02:23.295 --> 00:02:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well,
I guess I simply

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
went to Mexico when
I was 29 years old,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and I was still a graduate
student at the time.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was quite taken by
the Mayan civilization,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.340 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge they had, and
I got this strong feeling

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.870 align:middle line:84%
that their calendar is
true in some deep way

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't really
figured out ourselves.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that experience of
feeling this and the experience

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:84%
that this is where my
purpose of my life is--

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:90%
that's where it is.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.270 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:90%
It stayed with me.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And then there came
a point in time--

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I had been at the
University of Washington

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.300 align:middle line:84%
in Seattle working there
for 10 years as a scientist,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and then I decided
to leave that.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to devote myself
full-time, starting 1993,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
to finding out what is
their calendar about,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
because in certain ways, it's so
different from other calendars

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.045 align:middle line:84%
on our planet, and
that's fascinated me.

00:03:40.045 --> 00:03:43.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Carl, was it a
dramatic shift for you?

00:03:43.315 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I never
saw it like that,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:84%
because I felt this is just
another science, so to speak.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just a
broadening of science,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:84%
incorporating what the
Native American peoples had.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the most advanced
intellectual expressions

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Native American peoples,
I would say, came with the Maya.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I just looked
upon it as expanding.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But then that's not how
the scientific community

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:90%
would always look upon it.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:84%
They would say that this is an
area you can't really go into--

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: That's how it is.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.435 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't that
big a shift for me.

00:04:31.435 --> 00:04:32.235 align:middle line:90%
It was natural.

00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain to us, Carl,
what the Mayan calendar is.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, first of all,
there are so many calendars.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.340 align:middle line:90%
You can count 100 calendars.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:84%
But they're all connected, or
most of them are connected.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And for instance,
there is something

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
called the sacred calendar,
which is 260 days long,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and it always goes 260 days,
and then it goes on to 260 days.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And people were curious about
this because our own calendars

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
are based on astronomy, but
there is no astronomical

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:84%
connection to a
260-day calendar.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:90%
And so it's something else.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And what I've come
to conclude is

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
that these are
waves of describing

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of
consciousness, and that's

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.540 align:middle line:84%
why they do not follow the
astronomical cycles in the way

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.326 align:middle line:84%
that all other calendars
do on our planet.

00:05:39.326 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they
put this together,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.445 align:middle line:84%
how long ago are
we talking about?

00:05:43.445 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, I think you
can say the sacred calendar is

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.100 align:middle line:90%
about 3,000 years old.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That old?

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: That old, yes.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And they fairly recently
pushed the date back,

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.528 align:middle line:90%
so it came to that.

00:05:57.528 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did they have
so many different calendars?

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, because they
felt that it was prophetic,

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to find
out which ones are really

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:84%
prophetic, which ones can we
really learn about where we are

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and where we're going,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you can take the
study of the Mayan calendar

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:84%
to any level of
complexity depending

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:84%
on how many of these calendars
you're putting together,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that has
made it a little bit

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:84%
difficult to explain the
Mayan calendar because there

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:84%
are certain calendars that
are very much to the point,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I would say, and others
that it's much harder to see

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:90%
what they really were about.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The 2012 date--

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:48.475 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
that represent?

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.345 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
the Mayans expected?

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well,
what it did represent

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:84%
is that there was something
called the Long Count starting

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:84%
3114 BC before, and
that's their chronology.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Like we have the
Christian chronology

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and the Muslims have the
Muslim chronology, so to speak.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
We have chronologies where we
relate all historical events to.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And so to them, whenever they
built a pyramid, whenever

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:84%
a king was crowned or
something like that,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:84%
they would date it based on
this so-called Long Count.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long-form calendar?

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Long form.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.045 align:middle line:84%
And that came to an end
at that particular date.

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:90%
And so that's why--

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:90%
yeah, that's what is about.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have an image
from your book depicting

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.093 align:middle line:90%
the days of the Mayan calendar.

00:07:52.093 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at it, and
tell us what these represent.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: OK.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:84%
What you have here
is a wave movement.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And I prefer to describe these
calendars as waves because there

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
are time periods here called
day that are creative,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:84%
forward movement, and then
there are time periods that

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
are valleys or you
could call them

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:84%
nights when things are
going backwards or resting

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.270 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And what you see here is that
all of these peaks and valleys,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
they are connected
to various deities,

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and these deities then
had certain qualities.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:44.755 align:middle line:84%
And they expected that in the
corresponding time periods,

00:08:44.755 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:84%
these deities would
dominate the world.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And as they dominated
the world, they

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:90%
would shape the human reality.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
For instance, this is--
it starts with a god

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.510 align:middle line:84%
of procreation,
Xiuhtecuhtli, as it's called,

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
meaning that that's a time
period when things are seeded--

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:84%
new ideas, the
sowing, so to speak.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And then there is an
evolutionary process

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:84%
going through from
sowing, germination,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:84%
sprouting, up to the mature
fruition, so to speak.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So the waveform describes
an evolutionary process

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.135 align:middle line:84%
so that every step
usually adds another--

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:31.935 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Layer.

00:09:31.935 --> 00:09:34.842 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: --layer to what
had existed previously.

00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they have
so many deities, Carl?

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, they need
one for every time period.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.435 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: So
here they have 13.

00:09:44.435 --> 00:09:46.205 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm familiar
with Quetzalcoatl.

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, that is a
significant deity, god of light.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And that particular
deity was considered

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:84%
as the bringer of life and
the bringer of civilization.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
worship these gods?

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes, like
Quetzalcoatl in particular,

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.010 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:84%
There are several of
their pyramids dedicated

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:90%
to Quetzalcoatl.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in
Chichén Itzá, which

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is the most visited of all
Mayan sites in the Yucatán,

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:90%
there is the central pyramid.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the pyramid
of Quetzalcoatl.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
the plumed serpent

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.792 align:middle line:84%
moving down the staircase
from this pyramid.

00:10:38.792 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you just
mentioned the plumed serpent.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is that?

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well,
plumed serpent,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.030 align:middle line:84%
it's another name
for Quetzalcoatl

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.047 align:middle line:84%
or that we translate
Quetzalcoatl to.

00:10:50.047 --> 00:10:51.005 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's that God?

00:10:51.005 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yes, it's that God.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
the way I look upon it

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.614 align:middle line:84%
is that the plumed
serpent is just--

00:11:00.614 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:84%
it's another name for this wave
movement that we just looked at.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So even though there is
a particular energy, time

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:84%
when the plumed serpent
was particularly prominent,

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.720 align:middle line:84%
the whole wave is a plumed
serpent, as I see it.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
at another illustration

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan stepped
pyramid and tell us

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:84%
what the serpent significance
is in this photograph.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: OK.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.363 align:middle line:90%
Yes, so here we have it.

00:11:30.363 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:90%
But I just mentioned--

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.322 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They built that?

00:11:32.322 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: They built that.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's an amazing
experience to be there.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If a human was standing
by it, Carl, how big would it

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:90%
look?

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: It's not that big.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.485 align:middle line:84%
It's like 25 yards
high, this particular--

00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe
that first layer

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.095 align:middle line:90%
would be the size of a human?

00:11:49.095 --> 00:11:49.895 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:11:49.895 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Down at the bottom?

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: It makes sense.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.435 align:middle line:90%
But here you have the pyramid.

00:11:56.435 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:84%
The house at the top is
supposed to symbolize

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:84%
the center of the
universe, and it's

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:84%
from that center of the
universe that all of these waves

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:90%
are emanating.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And these waves then, we
are downloading these waves

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:90%
and creating reality with them.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
But then you can see
here also at the bottom,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.330 align:middle line:84%
down at the bottom
left there, you

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:84%
see the head of
this plumed serpent.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see
seven triangles of light

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.110 align:middle line:84%
going down into that, and those
were actually the seven days

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
that we just saw at
the earlier picture.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So this particular
light phenomenon

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:43.100 align:middle line:84%
where seven triangles
of light are formed,

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:84%
it only happens
on the equinoxes.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this
live, so to speak,

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's an amazing
experience because somehow it

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
goes into your marrow, how did
they build the pyramid to create

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.485 align:middle line:90%
that effect on just those--

00:13:00.485 --> 00:13:02.193 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're still
trying to figure out

00:13:02.193 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:90%
how the Egyptians did theirs.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, that's
an even bigger-- probably,

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.055 align:middle line:84%
but this is also
another thing here.

00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the little
opening at the top there?

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, it's
the door into-- it's sort

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.628 align:middle line:90%
of a little house on top there.

00:13:16.628 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's
something inside?

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: There
is something inside.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can go inside there,
and usually ceremonies

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.405 align:middle line:90%
were performed inside of this--

00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How intuitive
were the Mayans, Carl?

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.440 align:middle line:90%
How smart were they?

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: They must have been
intuitive, I think, in many ways

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:84%
that we do not count or we
don't include, so to speak.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to tell.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But we also do know that
they were using mushrooms

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:90%
for enhancing their other--

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like ayahuasca?

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, enhancing
their otherworldly experiences

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.740 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.295 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to have
been a significant part.

00:14:02.295 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it hallucinogenic?

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.335 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:14:04.335 --> 00:14:05.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was?

00:14:05.115 --> 00:14:05.915 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:14:05.915 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so there's a
lot of mushroom cults

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:90%
found among the Maya.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important
was time to them?

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN:
Everything, everything.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So everything was
organized around time.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So just for instance, there is
a 20-days calendar that's part

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred calendar, and
every day in the calendar

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.390 align:middle line:84%
specifies, for instance, what
you're supposed to eat on that

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:35.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:14:35.805 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.272 align:middle line:90%
So they had a time-based diet.

00:14:40.272 --> 00:14:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything
was programmed?

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Everything
was programmed with time,

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:44.980 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You eat this.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:90%
You sleep here.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:90%
You do this.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:90%
You do that.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Right.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Politically, at least
in their later history,

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
they would have
different cities becoming

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.570 align:middle line:84%
the capital, which is very
strange to our way of thinking.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, this
month it's Washington DC.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Next month it's Baltimore.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chicago.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Chicago or
something like that.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:90%
But they actually had that.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's also a
time-based thing

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:84%
because whatever Chicago
would have been would be just

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:90%
that particular time period.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we have only four
surviving books from the Maya,

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.725 align:middle line:90%
and those are all calendars.

00:15:32.725 --> 00:15:34.475 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
brilliant people, Carl?

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, I think so.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
They were brilliant in
understanding the cosmos

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and connecting themselves
to the cosmos, I would say.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.563 align:middle line:84%
They were very cosmic
people, I would say.

00:15:46.563 --> 00:15:47.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why so many calendars?

00:15:47.855 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, because I
think they were exploring.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
asking the question--

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.860 align:middle line:84%
if you go to a
university here and ask,

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:84%
why do you have so many
departments in the university?

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, to them, they had probably
many different calendars,

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to find out
which one corresponds mostly

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.785 align:middle line:84%
to the changes we
experience here.

00:16:16.785 --> 00:16:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people feel
that time is going by quicker.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.130 align:middle line:84%
It seems like every year they
go, what happened to that year?

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:90%
It went by so fast.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:25.882 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel that way too?

00:16:25.882 --> 00:16:27.615 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Oh,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:16:27.615 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What generates that?

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, part of it, I
mean, some people say it's age,

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and I think, yes, I might
have come to that age where

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:90%
things just flow on.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But then it's also
something else.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:47.550 align:middle line:84%
We saw an example of
a wave movement there,

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:84%
but these waves, the nine waves
that the pyramid describes,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:90%
they have different frequencies.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And as history has progressed,
as the history of the universe

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:84%
has progressed, the frequency
of these waves have increased,

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:84%
meaning that if you
go back 100,000 years,

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:16.920 align:middle line:84%
changes were very slow
presumably, as far as we know.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:84%
Whereas now, especially
recently when

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:23.160 align:middle line:84%
the eighth and the
ninth wave have

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:84%
been activated with
much higher frequencies,

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.410 align:middle line:84%
things are changing
much more rapidly.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring consciousness, Carl,
into the equation for a moment.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.115 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean to
you, consciousness?

00:17:35.115 --> 00:17:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well,
to me, it simply

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:84%
means the ability to have
a subjective experience.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And without
subjective experience,

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:90%
you don't have meaning.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.310 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a significance.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:90%
You don't have value, really.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it means.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's something that--

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:84%
to me, it's something
that we download.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we have a visual
representation of consciousness

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.830 align:middle line:90%
from your book.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Break it down.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that'll help explain this.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: OK.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the
wave again, and then you

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:84%
see there is the
arrow pointing time.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.880 align:middle line:10%
So the wave obviously
moves with time.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.200 align:middle line:10%
And then consciousness, it's
sort of an invisible shape

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:10%
And time and space actually
are aspects of consciousness.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But we'll never be
able to demonstrate

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.690 align:middle line:84%
the existence of
that consciousness

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.320 align:middle line:84%
because consciousness,
as I understand it

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and several of the
pioneers of quantum physics

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:84%
would say the same thing,
consciousness is primordial.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.375 align:middle line:84%
It's the most basic things
that exist in the universe.

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:04.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:19:04.255 --> 00:19:05.055 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:19:05.055 --> 00:19:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: So no
instrument is going

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.240 align:middle line:84%
to be able to demonstrate
consciousness.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does the Big
Bang theory tie into this?

00:19:13.965 --> 00:19:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: It ties in a
very good way, so to speak.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.130 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the 9
levels of the pyramid

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:84%
that we looked at,
then the bottom level

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
begins a little bit before
the Big Bang, so to speak.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is a little bit
before the Big Bang--

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.590 align:middle line:84%
is interesting because now
this James Webb Space Telescope

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:90%
is pushing it back.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
They're saying
there is something.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.845 align:middle line:84%
They're not saying that the
Big Bang didn't happen--

00:19:46.845 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's getting us to
the beginning of the Big Bang

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And before that, and there is
something happening before that.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.935 align:middle line:84%
And that, I believe,
is just sort

00:19:56.935 --> 00:20:02.380 align:middle line:84%
of some kind of a gestation
period of the universe

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.680 align:middle line:84%
or something like that
before the Big Bang.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting,
if you think

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:14.230 align:middle line:84%
about these wave movements
as what they describe

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.750 align:middle line:90%
that the plumed serpent--

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and call that wave movement
of the plumed serpent--

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:84%
is the bringer of
life, then the Big Bang

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
just becomes one step in the
evolution of consciousness.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:84%
It sort of provides an
important another layer.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It's another layer,
and it prepares

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:84%
for what later becomes
cells of different kinds.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:49.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just a
material explosion.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
It's part of one
of these waves that

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:84%
has a direction
of creating life,

00:20:55.090 --> 00:21:00.467 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they honored the
plumed serpent or Quetzalcoatl.

00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, well,
let's look at our next picture

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and tell us what
we're looking at here.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: OK, well,
this is how I see it.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:09.820 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of a--

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:10.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you draw this?

00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: No, but my
collaborator in Sweden drew it.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:10%
>>CALLEMAN: And you can
look upon these spheres.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Each one is like a holon and
it's an aspect of consciousness.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.770 align:middle line:10%
And the way I look
upon it is that there

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:10%
is a cosmic level of
consciousness at the very top

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:10%
there, and then
that trickles down

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:10%
to the galactic,
heliospheric, global.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And we are here receiving
a state of consciousness.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And we can leave the
lowest levels aside here.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But that's how I look
upon it, that there

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
are aspects of our
consciousness that are

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.875 align:middle line:90%
determined at the cosmic level.

00:21:59.875 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the
Maya understand this?

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.665 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: They certainly
had the cosmic perspective.

00:22:05.665 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't say that
they had any identical.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe, maybe.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:19.330 align:middle line:10%
>>CALLEMAN: If you looked at
that picture, there are crosses.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:10%
Each level it's a sphere,
but it's also a tree of life.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And we do know that the Maya
looked upon each human being

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:84%
as a reflection of
the tree of life,

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and we do know that they looked
upon a galactic tree of life

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and even a cosmic tree of
life as the source of all

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.040 align:middle line:90%
these different things.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:49.985 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's not a big stretch
to say that they saw something

00:22:49.985 --> 00:22:50.785 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:22:50.785 --> 00:22:52.493 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
the universe, Carl,

00:22:52.493 --> 00:22:54.640 align:middle line:90%
could be holographic?

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I guess
that's what it is.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.345 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
there, isn't it?

00:22:58.345 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it real or not?

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah,
I think it's real.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:90%
It's very real.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Every level is sort of a
microcosm of the larger

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's holography,
I understand it as.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating work.

00:23:12.805 --> 00:23:13.605 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:23:13.605 --> 00:23:14.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You learned all this?

00:23:14.995 --> 00:23:17.613 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I learned
it somehow, yeah.

00:23:17.613 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From the ground up?

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Talk about, if you
can, why humans suddenly

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.787 align:middle line:84%
started to create paintings
on walls and stuff like that.

00:23:25.787 --> 00:23:26.745 align:middle line:90%
Why would they do that?

00:23:26.745 --> 00:23:28.215 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Well--

00:23:28.215 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they see?

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, human
beings do not create any--

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:84%
at least we haven't found any,
and I don't think they exist--

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:84%
any kind of art or symbols that
is older than 100,000 years old.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has found that.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:52.965 align:middle line:84%
And I think expression of art is
probably a natural human desire.

00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:53.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: To me, maybe
that's enough to explain

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:90%
why they did it.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But what is interesting is that,
if you look at these paintings--

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and I've visited some of these
places in France where they have

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.285 align:middle line:90%
the cave paintings--

00:24:11.285 --> 00:24:12.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they're gorgeous.

00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: They're gorgeous.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're amazing in how they
have portrayed and captured

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:90%
the essence of the animals.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, it's not
very structured, so to speak.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes the
animals are upside down,

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they're in
this direction and something

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.930 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like
they didn't have

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
any mind that
created horizontality

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:84%
or verticality that organized
the way that came later.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the way I look upon it is
that when this Long Count began

00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
5,100 years ago, the one that
really became the chronology

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:06.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Maya, then
that meant a shift.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And we see it because
then, suddenly,

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:13.020 align:middle line:84%
real civilizations with
the cities and pyramids

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:84%
and all these kinds of
things appear on our planet.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
people were starting

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:84%
to download another kind of
mind, a mind that gave them

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:25.620 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And it had good sides, it
had bad sides, I'm sure.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the Mayans
believe in God, Carl?

00:25:32.175 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:90%


00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.585 align:middle line:90%
Or a deity, a one-time deity?

00:25:36.585 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: One-time deity.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, they certainly
have many deities.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:84%
What I've asked
Mayan daykeepers,

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.874 align:middle line:90%
as they call the shamans there.

00:25:46.874 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
They think that
there is a deity,

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:90%
but they won't name his name.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:90%
It's too holy to say so.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.350 align:middle line:84%
But in ancient times,
it seems like they also

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:84%
had a deity called Itzamná that
was sort of a highest deity.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the
God, as we would have?

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.285 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: The God, yeah.

00:26:12.285 --> 00:26:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the Darwinist model?

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well,
these waves provides

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
a model where we
can understand how

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:84%
different life forms
with every peak sort of

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:90%
have emerged novelties.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:84%
These waves are creating
the cosmic reality,

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:84%
including the kind of life
forms that we have here.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that is how
new species come about.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It's because of these waves
that are creating new species.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But that goes against the sort
of dominating scientific model

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:04.265 align:middle line:84%
today, which says
that it's an accident.

00:27:04.265 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:84%
The whole Darwinist
idea is that life

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:13.890 align:middle line:84%
comes about through accidental
changes in the DNA and so forth.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:18.110 align:middle line:84%
But to me, what this
pyramid actually symbolizes

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:90%
is a cosmic plan.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:21.695 align:middle line:90%
It's where every--

00:27:21.695 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A cosmic time plan.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: A cosmic
time plan even.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
in the Mayan empire

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.875 align:middle line:90%
came up with all this?

00:27:30.875 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Probably--
I don't know.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.740 align:middle line:84%
As everywhere, I'm
sure there's just

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:43.920 align:middle line:84%
a limited group that sort of are
thinking about these matters.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.630 align:middle line:84%
It's estimated that
there might have been

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.580 align:middle line:90%
like eight million people in--

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.545 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:27:50.545 --> 00:27:51.215 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: It's a lot.

00:27:51.215 --> 00:27:52.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For that time period.

00:27:52.525 --> 00:27:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: It is a lot.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you think
about some of their cities

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:84%
at the time, it's estimated
that the biggest one, Tikal,

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.860 align:middle line:90%
had 80,000 inhabitants.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But then 80,000 people compared
with that in Europe at the time,

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.960 align:middle line:84%
maybe London and Paris had 500
people or something like that.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So it was significant, the size
of this culture for its time.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did they go?

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, they're
still there, I say.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
they say themselves.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're still there, and
now they might be 10 million

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:41.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:28:41.715 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Or 20 million.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.422 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't hear
anything about them.

00:28:44.422 --> 00:28:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: No, you may not.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you go
there, you find it.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Their culture
changed dramatically.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually, the
Spanish came and conquered them,

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and then they became integrated
in the European power world,

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.090 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about
the Maya civilization

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know yet
but you wish you did?

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I would have
liked to know if they had

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.386 align:middle line:90%
some ability to time travel.

00:29:17.386 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think they did?

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: I don't know.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's what I would like--

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:28.450 align:middle line:84%
they had a different way of
looking at time, and who knows?

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.265 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the ninth wave?

00:29:30.265 --> 00:29:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: The ninth wave is--

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:38.260 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid has nine levels,
and each one of those levels

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:42.760 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to a wave
like a plumed serpent.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And what the year
2012 represented

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.600 align:middle line:84%
means that all of these nine
levels have been activated,

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and the ninth wave is the
last one of the waves that

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.930 align:middle line:90%
have been activated.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:10%
And what you see on
this particular picture

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:08.380 align:middle line:10%
is that, if you look at these
five highest waves, to the right

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:13.000 align:middle line:10%
there you have various
filters to the face,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.530 align:middle line:10%
and these are filters that
express different states

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.570 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness simply.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And as you may see there,
the ninth wave, which

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:84%
is the most recent one and the
one with the highest frequency,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.720 align:middle line:90%
that has no filter.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.390 align:middle line:10%
It's a unity consciousness
in other words.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:40.660 align:middle line:10%
And that, as I understand, it is
where everything is meant to go.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.745 align:middle line:84%
That's where humanity
is meant to go--

00:30:42.745 --> 00:30:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: --to
come back actually

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.210 align:middle line:84%
to that state of
consciousness, of unity.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a colleague
of yours, Patricia Albere.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she discusses
this ninth wave, as you did,

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and the next phase
of human evolution.

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.976 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:31:00.976 --> 00:31:05.450 align:middle line:10%
>>PATRICIA ALBERE: Just shortly
after Carl Calleman wrote his

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:09.740 align:middle line:10%
wonderful and amazing book, "The
Nine Waves of Creation," we met.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.060 align:middle line:10%
He found me.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And we, to our great
delight, discovered

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:84%
that we were downloading, that
we were experiencing something

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:84%
very, very similar but
from different angles.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.730 align:middle line:84%
His was this incredible
overview and connection

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to the mind quantum
knowledge, which

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:35.270 align:middle line:84%
is incredibly illuminative
and important for everyone

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.280 align:middle line:90%
to really become aware of.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:84%
The jump that he speaks
about, the quantum jump of you

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:84%
literally move into a very
different consciousness,

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:90%
space, reality together.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you jump there, as you
find that ability to practice

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:58.040 align:middle line:84%
from there, to connect from
there, the portal opens up,

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and you basically experience
the purity, the power,

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.310 align:middle line:90%
the divinity of the ninth wave.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to do
with your personal process,

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.410 align:middle line:90%
your personal work.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.470 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be accessed
through self-reflection.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.810 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be accessed
through witnessing.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.770 align:middle line:84%
All of the things that
we're taught in separation

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:23.220 align:middle line:84%
that we're working with,
basically things that I had done

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.400 align:middle line:84%
for decades in working with
people on their healing,

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.730 align:middle line:84%
on their awakening, on
meditation, on being present--

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:35.830 align:middle line:84%
all of those things don't take
you where the jump takes you.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:90%
And so discovering--

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:90%
I named it mutual awakening.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:46.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a particular practice
that is definitely works.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.160 align:middle line:84%
People from around the world
for now, many, many years

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:84%
have discovered,
if they're willing,

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:58.740 align:middle line:84%
how to enter into this
madness and this domain

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:04.470 align:middle line:84%
together where the ninth wave
is actually visible, clear,

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to be growing
the more human beings that

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.870 align:middle line:84%
learn how to enter
into the portal

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:16.440 align:middle line:84%
where it actually exists,
something you can feel.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like cells dividing and
becoming a larger and larger,

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.690 align:middle line:90%
more complex body.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So this ninth wave is
where we are headed.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Most of us, those of
you who are listening,

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:84%
you've been working on
yourselves individually.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a particular
way in which

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.720 align:middle line:84%
we have been trained to
do that, and it's also

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:84%
thousands and thousands
of years of humans

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.540 align:middle line:84%
being separate
discovering themselves,

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.520 align:middle line:84%
discovering their
own momentum in life,

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.560 align:middle line:84%
their ability to make
a difference in life.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.330 align:middle line:90%
And this is utterly different.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:55.800 align:middle line:84%
It's sourced by
divinization itself,

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and it has a very different
and exquisite power and purity

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:06.660 align:middle line:84%
that if you are
interested and you

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:84%
want to find out how to
actually knock on that door

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:11.969 align:middle line:90%
and get through--

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:15.360 align:middle line:84%
at least I know one
way for sure to find

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.400 align:middle line:90%
it is through mutual awakening.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.889 align:middle line:84%
It's not something you
can sit by yourself

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:22.620 align:middle line:84%
and open yourself up
to being aligned with.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:27.630 align:middle line:84%
It actually is necessary
that you enter into something

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:30.738 align:middle line:90%
with more than yourself.

00:34:30.738 --> 00:34:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Carl, what do you
think of what she just said?

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.889 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Oh,
it's nice to hear.

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:37.650 align:middle line:84%
There is a reason
that the pyramids are

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:42.810 align:middle line:84%
built like terraces, and
that is that every level is

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:46.409 align:middle line:84%
like a quantum leap
to another level.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And what she's
talking about here

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:55.199 align:middle line:84%
is that when you do the final
quantum leap to the ninth wave.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And what initially
struck me with her work

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:90%
was the fact that--

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you asked earlier
what happened in 2012.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But it turned out then that one
of the things that happened,

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:12.960 align:middle line:84%
according to the Mayan calendar,
is that the ninth wave became

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.880 align:middle line:84%
active, and it turned out that
it was at that point in time

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that she also discovered
that people were starting

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.590 align:middle line:90%
to do that kind of a leap.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.440 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.732 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you agree with her?

00:35:27.732 --> 00:35:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: I mostly
agree with her.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.910 align:middle line:84%
In order to climb
to the top there,

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.640 align:middle line:84%
you have to have some
kind of connection

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:42.860 align:middle line:84%
to the cosmic similar
to God, so to speak,

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.130 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic consciousness
in that step.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.430 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
have that, I think.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:52.270 align:middle line:84%
You have to have faith
in something much bigger

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:53.560 align:middle line:90%
than yourself.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.410 align:middle line:84%
But then, in addition
to that, I think

00:35:56.410 --> 00:36:02.530 align:middle line:84%
what she is doing is valuable
practice for people to discover

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:09.490 align:middle line:84%
when they have together,
like mutually, experienced

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:14.140 align:middle line:84%
this kind of unity consciousness
that the ninth wave is bringing.

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
sixth wave, Carl?

00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: The sixth
wave is the one--

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:24.340 align:middle line:84%
it's the same as the Long Count
that started 5,100 years ago.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And it is basically the one that
creates human civilizations.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look at
the graphic that you brought.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: OK.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.625 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's the
last one of them.

00:36:38.625 --> 00:36:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the seventh
peak of the sixth wave?

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Right, so we saw
that earlier wave before,

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.980 align:middle line:84%
and now this is the last one
of those in the seventh--

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:90%
the seventh or the 13th of them.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chronologizing all
these events that have occurred?

00:36:56.175 --> 00:36:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, it does.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a significance?

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: I think so.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:08.280 align:middle line:84%
I think the world now,
after 2011 in particular,

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.570 align:middle line:90%
is going into--

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.310 align:middle line:90%
there is a downturn here.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:15.430 align:middle line:84%
There is a huge transformation
of the world going on,

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and I think, especially
this year, I think,

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:21.430 align:middle line:90%
will be very, very dramatic.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And we will just
have to hope that it

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.700 align:middle line:84%
will have the best kinds
of transformative aspects.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.900 align:middle line:84%
But the world that existed
before 2011, it won't come back.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do
empires collapse?

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Because they are
created by people downloading

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:45.370 align:middle line:90%
a particular mind of duality.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And that mind of
duality, it creates

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.120 align:middle line:84%
empires that would lead too
far to go into detail of that.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.160 align:middle line:90%
But it creates empires.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Then however, when the wave goes
into the valley, so to speak,

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:08.290 align:middle line:84%
the duality disappears
and it's sort

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:13.055 align:middle line:84%
of a Dark Age coming in where
much more troubling things are

00:38:13.055 --> 00:38:13.855 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:38:13.855 --> 00:38:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at our
final graphic, Carl,

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.315 align:middle line:84%
and tell us what
we're looking at here.

00:38:19.315 --> 00:38:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, here
we have it all in its--

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and what we saw then was
just the last peak there

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.410 align:middle line:90%
at this particular time.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:35.020 align:middle line:10%
And it's indisputable that
these beginning points and end

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:40.000 align:middle line:10%
points really do correspond
to very significant changes

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.362 align:middle line:10%
and emergence of empires
and collapses of empires.

00:38:44.362 --> 00:38:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
collapses of them too.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.135 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah.

00:38:46.135 --> 00:38:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
all seem to collapse.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: They all
seem to collapse.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And maybe simply because only if
they collapse will something new

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.010 align:middle line:90%
be able to take its place.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does technology
contribute to that?

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, I would think
this technology is a product

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.610 align:middle line:90%
of these waves as well.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.220 align:middle line:90%
That's how I look upon it.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our
calendar is different

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.960 align:middle line:90%
from the Mayan calendar.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, that's--

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting question.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, it's
an interesting question.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Why did they have that
particular and we did not?

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:29.800 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I think
they were very advanced

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.840 align:middle line:90%
in their calendrical studies.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.360 align:middle line:84%
They took it very seriously,
and they had asked questions

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.840 align:middle line:84%
about what is the meaningful
way of looking at the changing

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.640 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the
calendar that I

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.920 align:middle line:84%
would say that their calendar
is a quantum calendar.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not based on
physical events.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like ours is?

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Like ours is.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:00.237 align:middle line:84%
Ours is based on astronomical
physical cycles--

00:40:00.237 --> 00:40:01.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Full moons
and things like that?

00:40:01.945 --> 00:40:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Exactly.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, they had that as
well, but that was not

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:06.840 align:middle line:90%
their central calendar.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, ours is based on
our rotation around the sun,

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.825 align:middle line:90%
and theirs is not.

00:40:11.825 --> 00:40:12.625 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Right.

00:40:12.625 --> 00:40:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've been
looking at all of this,

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:18.490 align:middle line:84%
what is the single one
thing that fascinates you

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:20.050 align:middle line:90%
about all of this, Carl?

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Because it's been
a big step for you.

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Well, sure.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I've just felt that it gives--

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.120 align:middle line:84%
at least to me, it gives so
many answers to questions

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:28.930 align:middle line:90%
that I've had.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:30.472 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
to interpret it?

00:40:30.472 --> 00:40:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, there's
some moment of interpretation,

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.110 align:middle line:90%
yes, absolutely.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else might interpret
it quite differently,

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:43.840 align:middle line:84%
but I think there is also
factual evidence that

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.610 align:middle line:90%
is indisputable.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:47.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in God?

00:40:47.715 --> 00:40:52.890 align:middle line:84%
- Yes, to believe in God is
a strange-- but yes, do I--

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I can answer, do I
seek to connect to God?

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
hope for mankind?

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: I think so.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:06.110 align:middle line:10%
I think we're facing quite
difficult times but that--

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.380 align:middle line:10%
the point with these waves
is that they go up and down,

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.725 align:middle line:10%
and there will be coming--

00:41:10.725 --> 00:41:11.525 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Cycles.

00:41:11.525 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLEMAN: Cycles.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.750 align:middle line:90%
And there will be coming--

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:19.520 align:middle line:84%
once this very big
transformation is completed,

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.885 align:middle line:90%
I think there will be hope for--

00:41:20.885 --> 00:41:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people
track down your work?

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a website?

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLEMAN: Yeah, I
have, calleman.com.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.605 align:middle line:90%

eight books on amazon.com.

calendar, it has always

been a fascinating aspect of

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.420 align:middle line:10%
and Carl has been able
to at least decipher

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.690 align:middle line:10%
a lot of that for us.
