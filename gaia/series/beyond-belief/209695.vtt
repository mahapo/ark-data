happened back in 2012.

I was an unawakened,
regular human,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.307 align:middle line:90%

just doing my thing,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:10%
and one day, I sent-- this
was I think in May 2012.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.500 align:middle line:10%
I sent a prayer out
to the universe asking

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:10%
for assistance for planet Earth
and was a very earnest prayer.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:10%
I sent it out to all the
galactic beings out there

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:10%
and didn't hear
back for two weeks

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:10%
and then forgot
about the prayer.

And then one night
I went to bed,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:10%
and when I came
to consciousness,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:10%
I was on board an
extraterrestrial starship.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.180 align:middle line:90%
What did it look like?

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It was actually
very non-metallic,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
which I think from UFOs
and sci-fi stories,

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we tend to think
of starships as being very

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:84%
metallic, but this one
was comprised of light

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:90%
and some organic materials.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to say was
a biological type thing almost?

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Totally.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.628 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a plasma?

00:02:12.628 --> 00:02:14.010 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: How long were you gone?

00:02:16.878 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It seemed like I
was longed for a long time,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
but in I guess Earth
time, I was only

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.600 align:middle line:84%
longed for maybe eight
hours or seven hours.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you learn
when they brought you back?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: My extrasensory
perception increased 100-fold.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, before, I didn't have
any psychic abilities, and then

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, I was noticing
that I was getting downloads

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:84%
of information, that I was
seeing auras around people

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and things, and just
experiencing quite a bit

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:84%
of paranormal, I
would say, phenomena.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They gave you a gift.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Didn't they?

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: They sure did.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've been able to
use it time and time again now.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Now, my whole mission
is to be of service to people,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:90%
to be of service to humanity.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So whatever I can do to help,
and if I have some information

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.070 align:middle line:90%
to share, I'm happy to share it.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You help a
lot of people, Debbie,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:90%
with health-related issues.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Totally.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did that happen
because of this ET contactee?

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think, when people
have Akashic readings with me,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.923 align:middle line:84%
health is one of
the questions that

00:03:27.923 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
common questions that

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.525 align:middle line:90%
come up that people ask about.

00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm tapping into
their star lineage,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
or I'm tapping into their story
to see maybe how their health

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:90%
conditions developed.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Because I am a
proponent of believing

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that health conditions
can have an origination

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.665 align:middle line:90%
point from past lives, or--

00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They kind
of carry it through.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Don't they?

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had heard
things like, if somebody

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
drowned in a past life,
they're petrified of water

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:90%
in this life.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.442 align:middle line:90%
Is that the case?

00:04:05.442 --> 00:04:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, totally.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that a lot with the
Akashic readings I've done.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I did an Akashic reading
once for a friend of mine

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:84%
who had an unnatural
fear of the dark.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.055 align:middle line:90%
Like she didn't even know.

00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had to have a light on.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:84%
She had to have a
light on all the time.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when I
checked her records,

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I noticed she had
a life in Egypt.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And she was the wife of a very
prominent high priest of Anubis

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And so
her husband died,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and I guess the
culture of the time

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
was she was supposed to die and
go with him to the afterlife.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And so when she took--

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:84%
so she asked them, well,
just give me a poison,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and I just want to get
taken out really quickly.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess she was
put into the sarcophagus,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:90%
and she took the poison but--

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and then put into
the sarcophagus--

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.940 align:middle line:90%
but then, she awakened.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a strong enough.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It wasn't potent.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It wasn't as
potent as she had hoped,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.702 align:middle line:84%
and so she was stuck
in this sarcophagus.

00:05:12.702 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it closed?

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, totally.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, it was terrible.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when I told
her this story,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I saw this in her
Akashic records,

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:84%
she was-- it was like a light
bulb went off in her head.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And she says, oh my
God, now I understand

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle line:84%
why I'm so careful
with medications

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and why I'm so
afraid of the dark.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:90%
So there are stories like that.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are starseeds?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Starseeds
are individuals

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:84%
that are having a human
experience here on Earth.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.100 align:middle line:84%
They're choosing to have
a human incarnation,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:84%
but their souls originated
from other star systems,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
other dimensions,
and other realities.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
physically human?

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, totally.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is health
so important to them?

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Health is really
important, I would say,

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:90%
specifically for--

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I think health is
important for everybody.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I actually love that
lady's enthusiasm.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She was bubbly.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:90%
She was bubbly.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.960 align:middle line:84%
She was very enthusiastic,
and I feel the same way.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.532 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like, I'm so--

00:06:17.532 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hold you back.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Hold you back.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm so passionate
about this topic,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I'm glad
I'm here talking about it.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But I would say, health is
really important for starseeds

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and lightworkers,
because we are here to,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I think, embody the 5D
human, the new humanity

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be moving into
this new ascension process

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
transcend dimensions.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about transcending

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.735 align:middle line:84%
from third dimension
to the fifth dimension.

00:06:50.735 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a big leap.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It is a big leap.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to be
able to carry with us all

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.110 align:middle line:84%
the karmic patterns
that we've been dealing

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:84%
with in past lives or all
the setbacks that we've had,

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and that also includes
health conditions.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of starseeds right
now are doing a lot of clearing

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of healing, in
order to prepare themselves

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:90%
for the ascension process.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of my
clients that work

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:84%
with me are doing
this also, and that's

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:90%
why they ask these questions.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Because they want to
reach their potential,

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:84%
just like the gal on
the video was saying.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle line:84%
These star lineages,
how important

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.230 align:middle line:84%
are they in the
scheme of things?

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say,
they're extremely important.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I've done thousands
of Akashic readings,

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.613 align:middle line:90%
throughout the last few years.

00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For individuals
and people like that?

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: A lot of individuals,
a lot of families, couples,

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and star lineage
plays a huge part

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
in how, genetically,
we are able to navigate

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.890 align:middle line:90%
through physical reality.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And depending on what
star lineage you're from,

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:84%
can determine, well, what
kind of health conditions

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:84%
am I more susceptible
to, or what

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.490 align:middle line:84%
is it that will help
optimize my health?

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Or what is it I can do that will
really boost my star genetics?

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And these are things that I do
talk about quite a bit, when

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.450 align:middle line:90%
I do these Akashic readings.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These lineages, how
many are there out there,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and are they from the
galaxy, the universe?

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, I would
say specific to Earth,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:84%
there's probably the
same 22 different races

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:90%
that I see over and over again.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Because these are
the races that have

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.560 align:middle line:84%
chosen to be involved
with the Earth experiment.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So I tend to see a trend with
certain specific lineages,

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:84%
at least for those of us
that are incarnated here

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.740 align:middle line:90%
on Earth right now.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But to answer your
question overall,

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
there's a multitude of
star lineages out there.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they good, bad,
or are they all benevolent?

00:09:11.725 --> 00:09:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say,
the majority of them,

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:84%
as far as humans,
are benevolent,

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
but you do get some
folks that maybe

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
have had some incarnations
and some very dark lives

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:90%
in dark star systems.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So I do reading
sometimes for folks who

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:90%
have reptilian lineage, and--

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not good.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Not necessarily.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, reptilian can
be beneficial as well.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to
categorize one race

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
as being totally good or
totally bad, for sure.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people
ingest, sometimes,

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:84%
bad things, not necessarily
bad food but bad things

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:90%
for their psyche, their karma.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, completely.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I would say, in our current
Western reality, right now,

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:84%
or Western civilization reality,
we are bombarded with toxicity.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:84%
We're bombarded with
information overload,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
with EMFs, with other
components that can definitely

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:84%
have a negative effect on our
energy field, our auric fields.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So we start not feeling so good,
and sometimes we don't really

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:90%
have an explanation for it.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So as far as an
approach to health,

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I would say there's
three key components.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:84%
The first one being working
on our emotional health.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.345 align:middle line:90%
That is key.

00:10:36.345 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think that's
the key to the whole thing.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, it's
totally the key.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're spot on on that.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
The second one is
diet and exercise.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.200 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a
physical reality.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:84%
We're having our physical
manifestations in our bodies,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and so we do need to
take care of our bodies.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And then third
would be meditation.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is
it for people all to tap

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.100 align:middle line:90%
into their Akashic records?

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I would say--

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.648 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm biased,
but I think everybody

00:11:07.648 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:90%
should have an Akashic reading.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, be biased.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think everybody
should have an Akashic reading,

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and I also believe people
should do an Akashic clearing.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.768 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So clear old
patterns from their records.

00:11:19.768 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can do that?

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:90%
You can expunge your records?

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: You can.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I never knew that.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean, you could
take out some of the bad stuff.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Or minimize it
or disconnect the person's

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.502 align:middle line:84%
karmic attachment to an
old story that's playing

00:11:35.502 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
the coolest thing

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I've heard in a long time.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Well, thank you.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I think it's pretty
cool too, and I've

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.670 align:middle line:84%
seen people's lives
dramatically change

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.255 align:middle line:84%
after having an Akashic
reading or an Akashic clearing.

00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's
assume somebody

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:84%
did something horrendous
in their earlier life.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:90%
They're ashamed of it.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:90%
They're embarrassed.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.870 align:middle line:84%
They're disappointed
with themselves.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:84%
You can go into those records
and get that taken out,

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and it changes who
they are and what

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:84%
they are, almost to the point
where they didn't do it?

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, it
does work that way.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:84%
We do a invocation at the
end of each Akashic clearing

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
session, where we are
resetting Akashic--

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.230 align:middle line:84%
or resetting intentions
in that person's records

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:84%
or creating new
parameters, where

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.230 align:middle line:84%
they're realigned with their
original cosmic blueprint.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
disconnecting them also

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:37.130 align:middle line:84%
from any old soul contracts,
any old timelines, dimensions,

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:84%
stories, old karmic patterns
that are no longer serving

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:90%
their highest good.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So that would include
something like say a past life

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.990 align:middle line:84%
experience or even a
past experience here

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.003 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime, where it
might be affecting them.

00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
They might be running
these old patterns

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.878 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:12:53.878 --> 00:12:55.490 align:middle line:84%
But then we disconnect
them from that,

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and they're able
to move forward.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:90%
It is a beautiful thing.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, how can we slow down
our spiritual aging process?

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Can you?

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, I like to think
of spirituality, since we're

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.620 align:middle line:84%
like a four-part being, so
there's a spiritual component.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
There's the mental, there's
the physical, and also

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:90%
the emotional component.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, we can
de-age integrating

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.230 align:middle line:90%
all of these components.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:10%
So what I mentioned before
about emotional healing, that

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:10%
definitely has a
de-aging effect,

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:10%
in the sense that we
become less stressed.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:10%
You are not worried about
things so much anymore.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.400 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting enmeshed
into our negative emotions.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So that could have, in
itself, have a very strong

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:84%
de-aging component
to it, and that's

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.970 align:middle line:84%
part of what the
Akashic clearing does.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:84%
It just takes a person
through a process

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
of letting go of old connections
or old contracts that

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
are no longer serving
their highest good.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do some people,
Debbie, look their age?

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Other people look younger.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Some people look older.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.502 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:14:10.502 --> 00:14:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, I think
there's many components that

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.020 align:middle line:90%
are connected with that.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big proponent
of epigenetics.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Epigenetics
is molecules

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that are connected to
our DNA that is actually

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:90%
determined by our lifestyle.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not genetics that
have been inherited

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:90%
by our families, our parents.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So the way we live and
the choices that we make

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
can have a direct effect on
epigenetics and the point

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:84%
where we can reverse
old stuff, even

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:84%
past life stuff that may be
causing us to age faster.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I believe that I'm a
walking example of that.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I've done a tremendous
health transformation

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple of
years, and people tell me

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.865 align:middle line:84%
I look a lot younger now
than I did two years ago.

00:15:03.865 --> 00:15:06.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:84%
But there's a four-point
component to it--

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:84%
meditation with the spiritual,
connecting with your higher

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:84%
self, your higher guidance,
connecting with your star

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:84%
family, if you are a starseed,
will have a direct component

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.250 align:middle line:90%
in helping to de-age you.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Also, diet and exercise,
the high vibrational diet--

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:90%
that's a diet I also follow--

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.610 align:middle line:84%
will help you, because
food contains energy.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And we are all energy, and
ingesting higher dimensional

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
energy is definitely going
to raise our vibration.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Exercise helps so much
with the physical body,

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:49.580 align:middle line:90%
with toning ourselves, with us--

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:55.970 align:middle line:84%
it has a direct component on
components such as telomeres

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.777 align:middle line:90%
and mitochondria in our bodies.

00:15:58.777 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's important.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It is very important.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're able to
prolong those telomere lengths

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:84%
or those mitochondria
connections in our DNA,

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.210 align:middle line:84%
it just helps us to
strengthen overall.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So you have to take a
four-pronged approach

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:90%
to health.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.777 align:middle line:84%
Working on your emotions
is very important.

00:16:23.777 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Meditation.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: The shadow
work, the meditation,

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.770 align:middle line:84%
working on your
diet and exercise,

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and also just being in presence,
being in presence with who

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:84%
you are and having a
different reaction to things,

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:90%
like Bruce was talking about.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's bring this back
to your ET contactee episode.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Right.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
there to help us?

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Do they influence us
with things that we've

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.892 align:middle line:90%
been talking about tonight?

00:16:55.892 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I believe they do.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I know, just with my connection
with my Arcturian star family,

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
has helped me tremendously in
transforming my own health.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
They've guided me throughout the
way in some very unusual ways,

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:13.690 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:14.720 align:middle line:90%
I can tell some stories.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go ahead.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Tell us one.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So the first time
I met with you on this show,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.049 align:middle line:90%
I was quite a bit heavier and--

00:17:23.049 --> 00:17:25.792 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.792 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
a little heavier.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:90%
You were.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to say
anything, but you've

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.670 align:middle line:90%
lost a lot of weight.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I've lost 75
pounds, and the reason

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:84%
for that was because I
have tried all these diets,

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:90%
wasn't getting any results.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was frustrated,
and I felt that maybe I

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.990 align:middle line:90%
was doomed to be heavy.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked for
help from my guides.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, hey, guides, if you
want me to do this work,

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:90%
I have to be healthy.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:90%
I have to be--

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.833 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:17:52.833 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Have to be healthy.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
to lead by example.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Totally.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, totally.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So I can't be out there
in a unhealthy body,

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to be talking
about improving lives.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So my
guides kept showing me

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:84%
this ad for a bariatric
center, in South Denver.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
an oxygen thing.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: No, bariatric is--

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:90%
bariatric surgery is when--

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, OK.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.970 align:middle line:84%
It was when you make
your stomach smaller.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:90%
You had that done?

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I did have that done.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I tried
everything, and I was--

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hyperbaric is oxygen.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Hyperbaric
is oxygen. Absolutely.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.597 align:middle line:84%
So I kept seeing this ad
for bariatric surgery,

00:18:36.597 --> 00:18:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, well, I'm
not a candidate for that.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm not 100 pounds
overweight, and they

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:90%
kept showing me the ads.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK, I'll make
an appointment, and I did,

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and that appointment
changed my life.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I found that the
doctor I worked with,

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful doctor named
Dr. Long, here in Denver,

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:84%
told me I was a
candidate, told me

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.030 align:middle line:84%
that he could help
me change my life,

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.827 align:middle line:84%
and that the surgery
would help me.

00:19:03.827 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it did.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: And it did.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I had the surgery in June,
2020, and I did lose weight.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:90%
I lost 75 pounds.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's been
dramatic, Debbie.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
very dramatic, and it

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:84%
enabled me to reverse a lot of
my previous health conditions.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, though,
I also did the mental work.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So I did a lot of EMDR
during that time, which

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
is a type of therapy that helps
you reprogram old thinking

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
patterns, and people can
look up what EMDR means.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of therapy
just with traditional therapy.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I did shadow work around some
old stuff from past lives.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And so I
was working completely

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:90%
with my Arcturian heritage.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Like Arcturian starseeds,
were predisposed

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.820 align:middle line:84%
to certain conditions, and
I knew that from my work

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.200 align:middle line:90%
with the Akashic Records.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And just to give you an example,
we're prone to thyroid issues.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.040 align:middle line:90%
We're prone to--

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We as humans,
or your family?

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: My star
lineage, yeah.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.022 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, my star lineage.

00:20:14.022 --> 00:20:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
aware of that, though.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So I was aware of that,
and so I knew, OK,

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
in order to strengthen
these areas where I'm weak,

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.200 align:middle line:90%
I need to do certain things.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I need to take
some supplements that

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:90%
will support that.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:29.883 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:29.883 --> 00:20:31.997 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big booster in that.

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: That boost in that
area, such as ashwagandha,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:90%
that's an amazing herb.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Helps with stress, helps
with adrenal support.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Calms you down.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, calms you down.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.780 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing,
amazing, amazing herb.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:90%
I love ashwagandha.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Rhodiola rosea
another one that's

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.862 align:middle line:90%
really awesome, melatonin.

00:20:52.862 --> 00:20:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That helps you
calm down tremendously.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it?

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it give you
weird dreams, melatonin?

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Me, not so much,
but maybe some people it does.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you raise
your vibration level?

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I do it
through meditation,

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and I do it through
exposing myself

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.800 align:middle line:84%
to as many high-vibrational
things as possible.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So only watching
high-vibrational shows,

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
like here on Gaia, and listening
to high-vibrational music,

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:90%
reading inspiring books.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Attitude.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Attitude, having
good relationships with others,

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:34.350 align:middle line:84%
being present in the
reality that I'm in.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's many ways
you can-- even laughter

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:90%
can help with vibration.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.473 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely.

00:21:39.473 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Sometimes,
when I feel really down,

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I'll just watch a really
clean comedy show,

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:90%
and I'll be laughing.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just
roaring on the floor.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, just
like having a good time,

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.040 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.152 align:middle line:90%
I love comedy.

00:21:51.152 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laughter's
infectious too.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It certainly is.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do some people
laugh during very weird times?

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Like if somebody
falls down, people

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
tend to laugh, when
it's not funny,

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.210 align:middle line:90%
but why did they do that?

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think
it's a nervousness.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.273 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of a
nervous response maybe.

00:22:09.273 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe
because they didn't

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.160 align:middle line:90%
help the person or something?

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, or
they feel embarrassed.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So some people just have
a different reaction

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:90%
to maybe feeling embarrassed.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think because laughter
has a way of making

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:84%
one feel better, it's kind
of a knee-jerk reaction to,

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, that person
just hurt themselves,

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.980 align:middle line:90%
or that person died.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a knee-jerk
reaction, trying

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.320 align:middle line:90%
to make themselves feel better.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if somebody wants to
get into their Akashic records,

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:90%
what do they do first?

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Contact you?

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They can
do it on their own.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big believer
that we all have access

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:90%
to the Akashic record.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you tap into it?

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Usually through I do
what's called a light column.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So I just imagine myself in this
light column and then I just--

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.167 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a
transporter in "Star Trek?"

00:23:02.167 --> 00:23:03.625 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: No, not
quite like that.

00:23:03.625 --> 00:23:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: But the
light just connects you

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.490 align:middle line:90%
to the higher realms.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.350 align:middle line:90%
So you're just--

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you just
imagine light around you?

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, totally.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I do that every time I
start an Akashic reading.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big believer that we all
should be meditating at least

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:90%
a few minutes every day.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's common sense.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it's really
simple solutions

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
that, for some reason,
in our current society,

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:84%
we don't implement
anymore, like the ancients.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
modalities actually

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:84%
originated from
Sirius and Andromeda

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.263 align:middle line:90%
and some of our star ancestors.

00:23:36.263 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they
gave us a good gift.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Didn't they?

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.240 align:middle line:90%
They sure did.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and these star people came
to Earth with this knowledge,

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and they shared it with
our human ancestors.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And these modalities have been
in play for thousands of years,

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and the reason why is
because they've worked.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:90%
They work.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:84%
I think we've gone
away from that somewhat

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.970 align:middle line:90%
with allopathic medicine.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And as I was
mentioning before, I

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.870 align:middle line:84%
think allopathic medicine
definitely has its place.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:10%
I think, sometimes, we have
physical bodies that just need

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:10%
mechanical repair,
and just like I

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:10%
did with my bariatric surgery.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.840 align:middle line:10%
But then sometimes,
we need to bring

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.410 align:middle line:10%
in that vibrational component.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:84%
The supplements do
that through plants.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:84%
The diet does that
through also plants,

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:84%
because we should be eating
mostly a plant-based diet.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:84%
We do that through exercise,
because it raises endorphins.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And then we also do that
with sound therapies

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and other healing modalities
that we've inherited

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.718 align:middle line:90%
from our star ancestors.

00:24:46.718 --> 00:24:48.760 align:middle line:84%

>>SOLARIS: Yes, and I do
have trainings in health

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.690 align:middle line:10%
and starseed health,
starseed relationships,

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:10%
starseed components,
lifestyle components that

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:10%
will help people.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:84%
