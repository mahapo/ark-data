00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.634 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:11.259 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:12.960 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.450 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:10%
General

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: General Motors,
Ford, Chrysler, Mercedes,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:10%
Elio-- Elio?

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.180 align:middle line:90%
What is an Elio?

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, with us today
on "Beyond Belief"

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.770 align:middle line:84%
is the president of
Elio Motors, Paul Elio.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:10%
What is an Elio?

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL ELIO: Well, it is
personal transportation.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:10%
It's a three-wheel vehicle.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:10%
It sits two people front to
back instead of side by side.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:10%
That enables our mileage
of 84 miles per gallon.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.384 align:middle line:10%
It's engineered to the
highest safety ratings.

00:00:56.384 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:10%
Assembled in
Shreveport, Louisiana

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:10%
with 90% North American content
and sticker prices for $6,800.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you've
invented a new car.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.994 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Well, me and a whole
bunch of other folks, yeah.

00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it takes hundreds
of people to get a project

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:90%
this far along, you know?

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Whatever possessed
you, Paul, to do this?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: Well, it was 2008.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.572 align:middle line:84%
Oil was going through the roof,
and I owned an engineering firm

00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle line:84%
at the time that did new product
development in automotive.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'd watch the
news every night

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.591 align:middle line:84%
and just get frustrated seeing
all this wealth pour out

00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:23.277 align:middle line:90%
of our country.

00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:84%
One day I decided instead
of getting mad about it,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.835 align:middle line:84%
I'd go do something about
it, and I went into work

00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:28.627 align:middle line:84%
the next day, and I
kicked the project off.

00:01:28.627 --> 00:01:30.626 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a moment,
we're going to go outside,

00:01:30.626 --> 00:01:32.883 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to actually
see us with the Elio.

00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:90%
It's an incredible vehicle.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:10%
Now, this vehicle is not going
to bump off the big three,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.660 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: No.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I think we do very little in
the actual new car market.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.180 align:middle line:90%
This is a new thing.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think our two biggest
markets we create ourselves.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
It's an 'and' vehicle
for a lot of folks.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So you buy a minivan, an
SUV for a reason, right?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.090 align:middle line:84%
You want to take the whole
family to church on Sunday.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: You need a tow boat.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:84%
You need to get plywood
from Home Depot,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.309 align:middle line:84%
and then you get stuck driving
all this metal back and forth

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:03.760 align:middle line:90%
to work by yourself.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.354 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with small cars
is they're not cheap enough.

00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:84%
They don't get enough mileage to
make it make sense in addition

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:90%
to our big vehicle.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So we buy a big
vehicle for a reason,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and then we drive it when
it doesn't make sense.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.780 align:middle line:84%
At $6,800 and 84
miles per gallon,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense to have an
Elio and your big vehicle.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How much money?

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: $6,800.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: That's it.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or that's the
down payment, right?

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: No, no.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:90%
That's the sticker price.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The sticker
price is $6,800.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.793 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: And that's with air
conditioning, power windows,

00:02:28.793 --> 00:02:30.440 align:middle line:90%
power door locks, and stereo.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm going to buy 10.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
How were you able
to price point that?

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: So I don't have
an easy answer for that.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole bunch of
stuff that adds up, right?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is how we've
designed the vehicle.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
By working with the
suppliers-- we actually

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.865 align:middle line:84%
have a series of
supplier summits

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:48.864 align:middle line:84%
where all of the suppliers
get together and work

00:02:48.864 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:90%
on the vehicle as a group.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:84%
That's never been done
before to my knowledge.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
These suppliers normally
can't talk to each other,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:84%
so we optimize on the vehicle
rather than on the component.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:90%
That's part of it.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Part of it's the business model.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So we've abandoned the
package system, right?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So the big guys can build
like 10 million combinations

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:84%
of a given product, and
they don't because that

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.855 align:middle line:90%
would cripple their inventory.

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:13.813 align:middle line:84%
So they came up with the
package system, right?

00:03:13.813 --> 00:03:15.147 align:middle line:90%
LSX, X, and DX.

00:03:15.147 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:10%
The problem is, if I
want the leather seats,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.282 align:middle line:10%
I have to buy the fancy
wheels and the fancy radio--

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: --whether I
want to or not, right?

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.040 align:middle line:10%
So if you look
around your vehicle,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:10%
you spent thousands
of dollars on stuff

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.230 align:middle line:10%
you neither need nor want to get
the couple things you do want.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.566 align:middle line:84%
So all this content is designed
to be put on post manufacture.

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, the basic
stuff-- air conditioning,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.830 align:middle line:84%
power windows-- that
everybody wants is on there.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Necessity basically.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: And the way
the process works--

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.870 align:middle line:84%
you walk into our
showroom anytime

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.962 align:middle line:84%
from when we open and when
we close and say, you know,

00:03:41.962 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I want the orange automatic
with the blind spot

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.605 align:middle line:84%
detecting mirrors and the
lighted vanity mirror.

00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:84%
That goes to one of
seven marshalling centers

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.150 align:middle line:90%
where the content gets added.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.642 align:middle line:90%
We close our stores at 9:00 PM.

00:03:51.642 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:84%
We build up vehicles
till midnight,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.996 align:middle line:84%
so we have three hours
to clear the system.

00:03:54.996 --> 00:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
At midnight, the
vehicles go on trucks,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.078 align:middle line:84%
and with seven
marshalling centers,

00:03:58.078 --> 00:03:59.894 align:middle line:84%
we're within nine hours
of all our stores.

00:03:59.894 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So at 10:00 AM the next day, you
get the vehicle exactly the way

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:84%
you wanted it the day before no
matter what time you walked in.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.009 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: So that helps
us keep the cost down

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
because we don't force you
to buy a bunch of stuff

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:90%
you don't want.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.123 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now these little
cars are going to be available

00:04:12.123 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:90%
all over the place?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.975 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Yes, all 50 states.

00:04:14.975 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you need
any special licensing

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.204 align:middle line:10%
to drive one of these?

00:04:18.204 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Again, not
an easy answer.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.852 align:middle line:84%
So because of the three
wheels, the federal government

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:90%
says it's a motorcycle.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Two in the front,
one in the back, right?

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: Right.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have successfully
changed laws in a lot of states

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:90%
and are continuing to do so.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
We're creating a new
category called an autocycle,

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and an autocycle is
a three-wheel vehicle

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:84%
that's enclosed with
at least three airbags,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.959 align:middle line:90%
automotive controls.

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't have
to wear a helmet?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Don't have
to wear a helmet.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.643 align:middle line:10%
Don't need a motorcycle license.

00:04:42.643 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:10%
And so far we've been very,
very successful at that.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.476 align:middle line:84%
Recently Senator
Vitter of Louisiana

00:04:48.476 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:84%
introduced legislation
in the US Senate

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.140 align:middle line:84%
to create that
category, autocycle.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So folks are
starting to see what

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:84%
we're doing is creating
a new category, right?

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.997 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely different
than a three-wheel Harley.

00:04:59.997 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.746 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: That's truly a
motorcycle with three wheels,

00:05:02.746 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's not quite a car, and
it needs its own definition

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
to become a segment.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, not everybody
can plunk down succeed $6,800.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: Right.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they buy this?

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Are you financing them?

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: So we will have a
creative financing plan.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Basically the value
proposition is so strong,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.537 align:middle line:84%
the gas savings can
make your payments.

00:05:24.537 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So the way it works is you
walk into our showroom,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:90%
sign your name.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:84%
We give you a brand new
vehicle and a credit card

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:84%
with a $300 limit on it, and
let you walk back out the door.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.108 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No money down?

00:05:33.108 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: No money down.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.271 align:middle line:84%
Now, the deal is you have
to charge all your fuel

00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:38.260 align:middle line:84%
with that credit card,
and every time you

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:90%
buy gas we charge you triple.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now, what if you're
buying gas with your other car.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.504 align:middle line:10%
Is that OK?

00:05:44.504 --> 00:05:45.670 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: With you other card?

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.779 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Your other car.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Yeah.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's OK, too.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.100 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Right.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.679 align:middle line:84%
So every time you buy
gas we charge you triple.

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you buy $10 worth
of gas, it shows up

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:84%
as a $30 charge on your
credit card statement,

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and that $20 extra goes
to paying down your loan.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: That's your car payment.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: And as long as you
drove into the dealership

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.696 align:middle line:84%
in something that gets 27
miles to the gallon or less, it

00:06:06.696 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:90%
more than covers it, right?

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.995 align:middle line:90%
Because 3 times 27 is 81.

00:06:08.995 --> 00:06:09.962 align:middle line:90%
We get 84.

00:06:09.962 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:10%
So from the consumer's
perspective,

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.253 align:middle line:10%
they have a brand new
vehicle under warranty

00:06:13.253 --> 00:06:14.376 align:middle line:10%
that's fun to drive.

00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:10%
They don't have a
car payment, and they

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.120 align:middle line:10%
are guaranteed to spend
less on gas next month

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:10%
at triple the amount than
they did in their old car.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Now there will
be a minimum amount

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:10%
that you have to charge, right?

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:10%
You can't just charge $2
a month forever, right?

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And again, though,
if you have another car, one

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
of the big ones, if you
use that gas card on that,

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:84%
you'll accumulate
those points, right?

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Well, I think
you really just want

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:90%
to use it on your Elio.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So what we're trying
to do is to show

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that the gas saving is more
substantial than the car

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:90%
payment.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.331 align:middle line:90%
The car pays for itself.

00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:45.830 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:10%
That what's that's doing.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, what if
they come up short, though,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the month?

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:10%
What if they've only
charged $20 in gasoline

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:10%
for whatever reason.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.816 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: So we'll farm
this out to a bank, right?

00:06:57.816 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they'll
have a rule where,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.480 align:middle line:84%
if you don't charge enough, a
minimum amount will move over

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.300 align:middle line:84%
to your credit card
to make the payment.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they need
to make the payment, right.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.725 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Because
they will all get

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:07.820 align:middle line:84%
paid back in some reasonable
time, 60 or 72 months, right?

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.411 align:middle line:84%
But if you play by the rules
and you drive a normal amount,

00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:84%
your gas savings will more
than make your car payment.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.330 align:middle line:90%
It is a free car.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is cool.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:90%
That's very innovative.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.199 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: And so
for the first time

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
the automobile it's

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
cheaper to drive a brand
new vehicle under warranty

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:90%
than a clunker.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.670 align:middle line:90%
That's never been true before.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now, let's talk
about some of the safety

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:10%
provisions of this car.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:10%
It's small.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:10%
It's made out of
what, fiberglass?

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: So first of all, let's
[INAUDIBLE] on the small.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.312 align:middle line:84%
So it's 110 inches long,
so we have the same wheel

00:07:37.312 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:90%
base as a Honda Accord.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's full size
vehicle cut in half.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Seats two people.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.860 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Seats two people front
to back, but when you get in it

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.639 align:middle line:10%
and experience it, it's
what you're used to, right?

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.180 align:middle line:84%
From the center line
in your chest to

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.711 align:middle line:90%
the door is what you're used to.

00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
It's as long as
what you're used to.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:90%
It's just half the vehicle.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And when you
say front to back,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:10%
that means somebody
sitting behind you?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Right.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's like one of those
old planes from the-- you know?

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.686 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tell me
a little bit more

00:08:00.686 --> 00:08:03.070 align:middle line:10%
about the safety
measures of the Elio.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Well, it's got
an extremely long nose

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:10%
for crush zone, right?

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.359 align:middle line:84%
So the problem isn't going
from 35 miles an hour to 0.

00:08:10.359 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:90%
You do that all the time.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
It's how long does it take
you to do that, right?

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.346 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: And by having steel
that is crushing and absorbing

00:08:16.346 --> 00:08:19.740 align:middle line:84%
energy extends the duration of
event and makes it much safer.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.260 align:middle line:84%
We have obviously two seat
belts, three airbags-- front

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:23.850 align:middle line:90%
and two sides.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: And the unique thing
about our configuration--

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
in the vehicle you
go to work in today,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
only one airbag fires
per event depending

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.465 align:middle line:90%
on the angle of incidence.

00:08:33.465 --> 00:08:35.589 align:middle line:84%
We can fire all three of
our airbags in every event

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and hold you in this
cocoon of airbags, which

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:90%
provides additional safety.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:84%
We have a full roll
cage around you

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.809 align:middle line:84%
and then structural composite
panels adhered to that.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you in this
cocoon until somebody

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.775 align:middle line:90%
comes and gets you out?

00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: No, no.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.230 align:middle line:84%
The airbags inflate, and
then they deflate, and then

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.915 align:middle line:90%
you can get out.

00:08:49.915 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK, after
the collision.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Yeah, just
like a normal airbag.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, all right.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's very innovative.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:84%
How long did you think
about this project?

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.739 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Well, I got
my engineering degree

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:01.738 align:middle line:84%
at General Motors Institute
in Flint, Michigan--

00:09:01.738 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:84%
now Kettering-- and
I always thought

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:84%
about doing a
three-wheel vehicle.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And in 2008, oil was
going through the roof,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:84%
and I would watch
the news and just

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.046 align:middle line:84%
get frustrated seeing
all this wealth pour out

00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:12.727 align:middle line:90%
of this country.

00:09:12.727 --> 00:09:14.310 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I had
an engineering firm

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that did new product
development in automotive,

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and one day I decided instead
of getting mad about it,

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.148 align:middle line:90%
I'd go do something about it.

00:09:19.148 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I went to work
and kicked it off.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Safety
we've talked about,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.390 align:middle line:90%
but what about things like snow?

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.990 align:middle line:90%
Does it have traction?

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Yes, so it's front
engine, front wheel drive.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So 70% of your mass
and all your traction

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:84%
happens over the
front two wheels

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:90%
in a front wheel drive car.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether
you're dragging one or two

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.890 align:middle line:90%
wheels through the snow.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it shimmy at all?

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: No.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have a 67 inch
tracks, so we're

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:90%
about as wide as a Ford Taurus.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's got a wide stance,
a low CG, and the simulation

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that you'll see shows
going 50 miles an hour

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:90%
and swerving as fast as you can.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
four wheel vehicles

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.915 align:middle line:10%
that will roll over
on that simulation,

00:09:55.915 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:10%
and you can see
we're very stable,

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:10%
and we don't have electronic
stability control modeled

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:10%
in the simulation, but it
is standard on the vehicle.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Obviously cars
aren't made for ice.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:84%
I assume the Elio
shouldn't be on ice either.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: It's comparable
to other vehicles.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the same technology.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gasoline, electric?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: It's gas.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.704 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, you went
the gas route, huh?

00:10:17.704 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Well, I think it's the
only thing that makes sense

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.470 align:middle line:10%
today for a project like this.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:10%
Like I said, this is all
about the value proposition,

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:10%
and we have a video
on our website called

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:10%
the perpetual motion
machine, right?

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:10%
If you could buy a perpetual
motion machine for $15,000,

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:10%
right-- you buy this thing.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:84%
You never ever put
fuel in it again.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.120 align:middle line:84%
That would be a
compelling value, right?

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be nice.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: It does not make sense
in light of an Elio, right?

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:84%
You spent $8,000 more for
your perpetual motion machine.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.232 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: If you drive 15,000
miles a year, $4 gallon of gas,

00:10:46.232 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and at $2 a gallon it works
even better, but at $4 a gallon

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:84%
of gas, you spend about
$800 a year in gas.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.574 align:middle line:84%
It takes you 10 years
and 150,000 miles

00:10:53.574 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:84%
to break even with your
professional motion machine,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And we all know they
don't last that long.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So if we electrified,
the price point goes up,

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and the value proposition
falls apart, right?

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So from a business
case standpoint,

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.013 align:middle line:84%
gas is definitely
the right way to go.

00:11:09.013 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what's
this bit we got here?

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.170 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: So one of the
tenets of the vehicle

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:10%
is no new technology, right?

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe technical
risk is the death

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:90%
knell of pre-revenue startups.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Even if you bet on
the right technology,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.475 align:middle line:84%
if it takes you six
months longer to work out

00:11:22.475 --> 00:11:24.300 align:middle line:84%
than you thought,
bad things happen,

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.340 align:middle line:84%
but we wanted to have
some cool design elements.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So this gauge cluster
is already tooled up.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:10%
There's no new technology here,
but I loved my dad's watch,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.636 align:middle line:10%
and this is from circa 1950.

00:11:35.636 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's still working.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:90%
It's still ticking.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.326 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: It is still ticking,
and so if you notice the hour

00:11:40.326 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:84%
stays center at the
top of the crystal,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.569 align:middle line:90%
and the minutes roll by.

00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought
that had a clean look,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.609 align:middle line:84%
so instead of mounting a
needle to this already tooled

00:11:47.609 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:84%
up gauge cluster,
we mounted a disk

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and modeled it after
my dad's watch.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.075 align:middle line:84%
And it gives the dash
a nice clean look.

00:11:53.075 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very simple.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: But without
taking a big risk.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Very simple, indeed.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:84%
If people want to get an
Elio, how do they find you?

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: So eliomotors.com
or Elio on Facebook,

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and you can put a
reservation down.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:90%
So we're taking reservations.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.944 align:middle line:84%
We have-- for
about two years, we

00:12:09.944 --> 00:12:11.595 align:middle line:84%
have 40,000 reservations
at this point.

00:12:11.595 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's your
target date to get

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.679 align:middle line:90%
these vehicles on the road?

00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: The first half of 2016.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.053 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's coming up.

00:12:17.053 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: It is.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.194 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:12:19.194 --> 00:12:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you have to wait in line?

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:84%
People who come
in today-- do they

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.130 align:middle line:84%
have to wait in line
for the vehicles?

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Yes, so that's the whole
point of the reservations--

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:90%
is the--

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get on fast.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, how are you going to sell
these beyond reservations?

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: So we will have
company-owned stores

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:90%
in the top 60 markets in the US.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So it'll be a show room in
a strip mall, regular mall.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:84%
You'll have one vehicle
inside, two outside

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate test
drives, and then the walls

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.149 align:middle line:84%
will be lined with options
per our earlier discussion.

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How about maintenance?

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.020 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: So Pep Boys
has agreed to be our--

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Pep Boys?

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: --authorized
service provider.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:52.720 align:middle line:90%
So we have--

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the car
parts company, right?

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:54.883 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: Right.

00:12:54.883 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So we have 800 service
locations day one.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So we have more
service locations

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:90%
than Volkswagen, Audi, and BMW.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.706 align:middle line:84%
Not as many as GM and Ford,
but it doesn't matter.

00:13:02.706 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:90%
It's enough coverage.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.038 align:middle line:84%
Like when you buy
a Volkswagen, you

00:13:05.038 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:84%
don't go, oh,
what's my coverage?

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.557 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the
Elio simple enough

00:13:08.557 --> 00:13:10.140 align:middle line:84%
where people can
putter around with it

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:90%
themselves, do little repairs?

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: It's a modern car,
so it's the same technology

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.277 align:middle line:84%
in an Elio as other
modern cars today.

00:13:17.277 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bring it to the--

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: So you--

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bring it
to Pep Boys, right?

00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: Yeah.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you can work on
the car in your driveway,

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.560 align:middle line:84%
you can work on
this or vice versa.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:90%
If you can't, you can't.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do people say
when they see this thing driving

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.371 align:middle line:90%
around the roads?

00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: Wow.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean everywhere we take it,
it draws an enormous crowd.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.097 align:middle line:84%
If we have it in
Manhattan, taxis

00:13:36.097 --> 00:13:37.680 align:middle line:84%
will stop in the
middle of the street,

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and get out, and take pictures,
and block-- yeah, it's nuts.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would
be a great taxi.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
If you only have one
person to pick up,

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:90%
it would be perfect, right?

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: Yeah.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.959 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In he goes,
and off you go.

00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Well, and a
delivery vehicle-- they're--

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pizzas.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.836 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: All sorts of
people drive around

00:13:53.836 --> 00:13:55.280 align:middle line:90%
by themselves doing their work.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.225 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people
who work in government

00:13:58.225 --> 00:14:00.080 align:middle line:84%
who are inspectors and
that kind of thing,

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.630 align:middle line:84%
people who are
delivering documents.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.504 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of folks
who are driving around

00:14:03.504 --> 00:14:04.925 align:middle line:90%
by themselves with a briefcase.

00:14:04.925 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think you could
get Domino's or Little Caesar's

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:90%
to buy a full fleet of these?

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: I would guess at
some point that will happen,

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.694 align:middle line:90%
because it makes sense, right?

00:14:13.694 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:84%
There again, when you look
at the value proposition,

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.800 align:middle line:90%
the car pays for itself.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What excites you
the most about this project?

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: It's the impact.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
My passion-- well, one of my
passions is our trade deficit,

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and we can reduce our trade
deficit due to foreign oil not

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.182 align:middle line:90%
purchased.

00:14:33.182 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:84%
It's built in
Shreveport, Louisiana

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:90%
with 90% North American content.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, good for you.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: That means
a lot to me, and I

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:84%
think long term we can
build it there and export it

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:90%
around the globe.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:10%
I think this is--

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.968 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How many jobs
will this develop there?

00:14:42.968 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: 1,500 in the factory
and then another 1,500

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:10%
in the supply base
throughout the country.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the repair
people and stuff like that?

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: Well, no.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.583 align:middle line:84%
Guys who are making
the seats, and who

00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:53.422 align:middle line:84%
are making the-- so
all the suppliers.

00:14:53.422 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So it's
even more when you

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.725 align:middle line:10%
add in the shops, and the repair
folks, and stuff like that.

00:14:58.725 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: Right, right.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.516 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:15:00.516 --> 00:15:02.934 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: And then the
economic development folks

00:15:02.934 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
give you credit for
six in the community

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.427 align:middle line:84%
for every direct
manufacturing job.

00:15:06.427 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So it will create 3,000
direct manufacturing

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:84%
jobs, another 18,000 jobs
in those communities.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you key in
on where the plant is today?

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Well, this plant
was part of RACER Trust,

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:21.660 align:middle line:84%
so all the shed properties from
GM went into the RACER Trust.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.632 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a four million
square foot facility,

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:90%
and to put that number into--

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good size.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.315 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Yeah, the
Empire State building

00:15:27.315 --> 00:15:29.231 align:middle line:10%
is 2.8 million square
feet, so it's almost one

00:15:29.231 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:10%
and a half Empire States.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And GM left all the
equipment behind,

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.360 align:middle line:84%
so everything you can possibly
imagine to manufacture

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.427 align:middle line:90%
a vehicle, I own.

00:15:36.427 --> 00:15:38.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They just
locked the door and left.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Well, it wasn't
quite like, but yeah.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The trustee
got it, right?

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: The trust got
it, and their mission

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:10%
was to repurpose
these, to not sell them

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:10%
to people who were
going tear them down,

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:10%
but to sell them to somebody
who can create jobs in it.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:10%
And so we were able to
acquire it from RACER Trust.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.310 align:middle line:10%
So Stu Lichter, my
board member, who's

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:10%
America's second largest
industrial real estate owner,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:10%
owns the real estate
and the building,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:10%
which we lease from him,
and then Elio Motors

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:10%
owns all the equipment inside.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many vehicles
can you pump out a day?

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.596 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: We are tooling it
up for 250,000 units a year.

00:16:08.596 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's good.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.210 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Yeah, so it's
1,000 cars a day.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That is good.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.510 align:middle line:90%
Couple shifts?

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIO: Yeah, two
shifts, and then we

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
work overtime and go over 250,
but at normal time, 250,000

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:20.560 align:middle line:90%
units.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And the car
itself, automatic, stick?

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIO: Yes, so it comes both
ways, standard and automatic.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of
the big three says

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:90%
we want to buy this company.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Would you sell it?

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: No, absolutely not.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.791 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, what
gets me up in the morning

00:16:33.791 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:84%
is the three things
we talked about,

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as I lose control,
that vision probably gets lost.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Paul, let's go outside.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to drive the Elio,
hopefully not into a curb

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:90%
So let's do that, OK?

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIO: Absolutely.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.035 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's the same
as any other car.

00:16:51.035 --> 00:17:03.755 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.755 --> 00:17:07.178 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this
was a fun ride.

00:17:07.178 --> 00:17:09.623 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait for you to get
this out into the marketplace.

00:17:09.623 --> 00:17:13.060 align:middle line:84%
There you have it,
the Paul Elio car.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:90%
