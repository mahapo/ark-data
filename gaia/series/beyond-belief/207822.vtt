>>CARSON: It tells me
we've got a lot to learn.

00:00:16.018 --> 00:00:17.710 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] There was
a galactic war,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.663 align:middle line:84%
and it all kind of
started over race.

00:00:20.663 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It does
everywhere, doesn't it?

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:84%
They actually had the capability
of sending a beam to a planet

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and destroying
the entire planet.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's worse
than an atomic bomb.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.982 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: We need
to learn from where

00:00:30.982 --> 00:00:32.380 align:middle line:90%
our progenitors came from.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And what type of wars
did they get into?

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:90%
And why were they at war?

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:84%
How did they then
create peace over time

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.820 align:middle line:84%
so that we can follow
that same path?

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
we're a warring race.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.603 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:00:42.603 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They had to have
some type of a drive that

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.895 align:middle line:84%
allowed them to
violate Einstein's

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:90%
theory of relativity.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bending space and time.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:84%

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:84%

gone through them all.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:90%
You look great.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you, sir.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:90%
I've been fantastic.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:90%
Everything's been great.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.363 align:middle line:84%
I've been healthy, thankfully,
and I have no complaints.

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:39.163 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:01:39.163 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
What is that ornament
around your neck?

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.468 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: This is
an obsidian stone

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.930 align:middle line:10%
that the Mayans used to use
to watch solar eclipses.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:10%
It would actually block
out the halo of the sun

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.060 align:middle line:10%
and let them see more
phenomenon in space.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where'd you get that?

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I actually got it
from a lady who made it by hand.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Soul Rays.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.827 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:56.827 --> 00:01:59.193 align:middle line:84%
How did you get interested
in extraterrestrial life?

00:01:59.193 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Well,
originally what happened

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:10%
was when I was a
little kid, I was

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.190 align:middle line:10%
in my backyard
playing around, and I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.498 align:middle line:10%
saw what looked like a
UFO crossing my backyard.

00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It probably was.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:84%
Because I saw
airplanes going over

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
from the private
airport that was nearby,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.052 align:middle line:90%
the Opa Locka Airport.

00:02:14.052 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And I just watched them
go across the sky, kind

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:90%
of like in slow motion.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:90%
And it really amazed me.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But one day, this object went
across in seconds, not minutes.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't have a fuselage,
or tail fin, a cockpit.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And then it came
back and stopped,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.147 align:middle line:90%
and it was just silent.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it just took off
the way that it came in.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what was that?

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So I went to my library at my
elementary school, Rainbow Park

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.478 align:middle line:84%
Elementary, and I took
down all the Encyclopedia

00:02:38.478 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Britannicas on aerospace, and
that's when I started research.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And that was back in 1977.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, we hear a
lot about the Pleiadian star

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Where exactly is
that in our cluster?

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, if you
look up from the night sky

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%
from the position--
usually from America,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:84%
looking up to the
upper left, you'll

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
see what they call
the Seven Sisters.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.198 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And the
Seven Sisters are

00:03:02.198 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:84%
the seven brightest
of the Pleiades,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
but not the only
stars in the Pleiades.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And so there's probably several
hundred thousand stars there.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But from our
perspective on Earth,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.615 align:middle line:90%
we see the seven brightest ones.

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You believe
they're behind some kind

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.830 align:middle line:90%
of galactic war.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what that is.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.195 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
what happened was

00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
if you look at a lot
of the ancient records,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
it seems as if several
billion years ago,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
there was a galactic war
in that region of space.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And this war, according
to the ancient text,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
it talks about the
Lyrans and the Sirians

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
starting this battle, also
with some Draconian people,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.223 align:middle line:84%
and it all kind of started
over race, unfortunately.

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It does
everywhere, doesn't it?

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unfortunately.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
What kind of weaponry
do you think they used?

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, in
the Mahabharata,

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:84%
they talk about using
a Brahma weapon, which

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
is a weapon that can destroy
any man on three worlds.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's some type of--

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's worse
than something--

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.468 align:middle line:90%
it's worse than an atomic bomb.

00:04:01.468 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, much worse.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Much worse.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:84%
It's some type of a targeted
weapon that can literally

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:84%
assassinate either
one person or destroy

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:84%
an entire civilization
or multiple civilizations

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.540 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they also had
something like on "Star Wars,"

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.829 align:middle line:84%
which is likened to a planetary
destroyer like a Death Star.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.715 align:middle line:84%
And these moon-sized weapons,
which we probably have one

00:04:23.715 --> 00:04:24.590 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system--

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I think Iapetus is probably one
as well in our solar system.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a moon of Saturn.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But they actually
had the capability

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:84%
of sending a beam to a
planet and destroying

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.685 align:middle line:90%
the entire planet.

00:04:33.685 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That
could have happened

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:84%
with the planet between
Mars and Jupiter,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:90%
what we call the asteroid belt.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, there
was a planet there

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.140 align:middle line:90%
named Tiamat in ancient times.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Also, that planet was
destroyed and blowing up

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:84%
according to the
ancient tablets,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.550 align:middle line:90%
and it became the asteroid belt.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.038 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there any
survivors of this situation?

00:04:53.038 --> 00:04:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: There were survivors.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was we had
a space refugee situation.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is you had
the Lyrans, the Sirians, Alpha

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Draconians, and all these
other groups that were

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:90%
living in those star systems.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And because these wars were
blowing up different planets

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and moons, that
debris was crashing

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.020 align:middle line:84%
into their actual homeland,
so their home planets--

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:84%
creating a mess in
that sector of space.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.247 align:middle line:84%
So according to the
ancient records,

00:05:19.247 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:84%
they started fleeing--
the survivors started

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:84%
fleeing into space and looking
for other homes, other places,

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
other star systems
to go move to.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.885 align:middle line:90%
And so they left.

00:05:26.885 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a
friend, Wayne Herschel,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:84%
who discussed the significance
of certain artifacts

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:90%
with references to the Pleiades.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.602 align:middle line:84%
>>WAYNE HERSCHEL: My
name's Wayne Herschel.

00:05:37.602 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:10%
I'm very pleased to show you
the ancient alien collection

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:10%
of ancient artifacts
that show star maps that

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:10%
show an ancient alien
presence in our history.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:10%
The Nineveh disk found
in the area of Nineveh

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:10%
in ancient Sumer, Sumeria.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.070 align:middle line:10%
This is quite amazing
here, because it

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:10%
has three dots in a row
that follows with an arrow.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm pretty convinced
this is Orion.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.250 align:middle line:10%
The most amazing thing with this
story is if you follow across--

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to turn it around--

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:10%
we have an X and an
arrow going through it.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:10%
I believe this is
telling the story--

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:10%
both arrows pointing
at each other,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:10%
telling the story in a
different way with astronomy

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.030 align:middle line:10%
and naming stars in
a cross formation

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.720 align:middle line:10%
and following three belt
stars as the arrow that

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:10%
points the way like the
Chi Rho of Constantine

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.735 align:middle line:10%
with the Christian history.

00:06:30.735 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:10%
But where does it point to?

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.910 align:middle line:10%
What is it showing to?

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:10%
Well, apparently, according
to Zecharia Sitchin,

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:10%
the writing here is follow,
follow just a little further.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:10%
And it's a cosmic traveler.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:10%
It's an Enki traveling.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:10%
I'm not too sure but it's
a cosmic travel following.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:10%
And it says follow, and past
the seven heavenly bodies.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.280 align:middle line:10%
Sitchin believed
these were planets.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:10%
I don't think so.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Sumerian
tablets show the Pleiades

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle line:10%
as being the collective cluster.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.640 align:middle line:10%
And it's a definite cluster.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:10%
The ground zero Sumerian seal.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:10%
Sitchin made this
one quite famous.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:10%
Museums like the British Museum
insisted this is the Pleiades.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:10%
A king standing on top of the
throne-- sorry, sitting on top

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:10%
of a lion that denotes
kingdom, kingship.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.150 align:middle line:10%
On his crown he has a star, but
there's also one next to it.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:10%
This is the real star.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.520 align:middle line:10%
This is his designated gold
star on top of his crown.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.420 align:middle line:10%
So don't mix the two.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.253 align:middle line:10%
That's the real one.

00:07:25.253 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:10%
This is one on his crown.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Is this an ancient astronaut?

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:90%
You tell me.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:10%
But what convincingly
completes the story

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:10%
is the disk that flies.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:10%
This is the means of flying.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:10%
This is the flying
disk celestial ship.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:10%
One of my most
favorite artifacts,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:10%
a big story in my book,
"The Hidden Records."

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:10%
It's so fantastic to see
the Pleiades in such detail.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.780 align:middle line:10%
Yes, it is the Pleiades.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:10%
Historians in the Berlin Museum
where this original is kept

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:10%
speak of it as the Pleiades.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:10%
A man in front of two disks,
two circular orbs, one big one

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:10%
and one small one.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:10%
Or is it a man
inside a ship that

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.400 align:middle line:10%
flies, holding onto
some kind of a gear

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:10%
and operating a mechanism?

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.765 align:middle line:10%
Could this be the
celestial ship?

00:08:11.765 --> 00:08:13.348 align:middle line:10%
Then we have Taurus
here and something

00:08:13.348 --> 00:08:14.430 align:middle line:10%
on the back of the bull.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:10%
I think this is what
really speaks volumes here.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:10%
This is the place where
the Pleiades resides.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:24.233 align:middle line:10%
And it's like a cartouche
that's emanating a light.

00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pretty
remarkable, Billy.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were those
authentic artifacts?

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They are scale copies
of the actual originals, which

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:84%
were in a lot of the
museums around the world.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you interpret
it the way Herschel did,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:84%
you could assume that these
extraterrestrials were

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
all over the place and
had high technology.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And we can find these
artifacts all over the world.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So those weren't
just in one location.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:84%
They were around
the entire planet.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.355 align:middle line:90%
And there's many more.

00:08:51.355 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And so what's really
amazing is the majority

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:84%
of these artifacts always seem
to point to the Pleiadian star

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.177 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
that seven cluster

00:08:59.177 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
that we saw in the corner that
they call the Seven Sisters.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Correct.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do they believe
there are planetary systems

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.638 align:middle line:90%
within the Pleiades?

00:09:07.638 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, there are.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So within the Pleiades,
you have so many stars

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:84%
that all have planets
orbiting them.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have multiple
solar systems

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:84%
in that region or
that sector of space

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and multiple advanced
civilizations

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
coming from that
one area of space.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about space refugees.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The space refugees
were several different races.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So the Lyrans, the Sirians,
the Atlanteans, the Nerubians.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
All these different
races that the--

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anunnaki?

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.473 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: The Anunnaki, correct.

00:09:40.473 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the Anunnaki is more
like a generalized term.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So anybody that comes from
any of those areas to Earth

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
is an Anunnaki, because
Anunnaki just means from heaven

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.675 align:middle line:90%
to Earth, they came.

00:09:49.675 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:90%
But they all actually had--

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could be 16 different
races for all we know.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Correct.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's been a
real misconception

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:90%
within the Sumerian tablets.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:84%
People tend to think that
they were just one race.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:10%
If you really analyze all
the different tablets,

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:10%
you realize that they
were multiple races coming

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:10%
from different star systems.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now these
ancient tablet

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
replicas that we looked at that
make reference to the Pleiades,

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.940 align:middle line:90%
what does that tell you?

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:90%
What's so important about this?

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: What's so important
is the past is prologue.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And so for us to really
move into a golden age

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.135 align:middle line:84%
in this era of mankind
moving forward,

00:10:24.135 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:84%
we really need to
understand what

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.718 align:middle line:90%
happened in the ancient past.

00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And what it looks like to
me from my observations

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:84%
with these ancient tablets
and all these records

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
left behind that we need
to learn from, first

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.090 align:middle line:84%
of all, where our
progenitors came from.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And also, what type of
wars did they get into,

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:90%
and why were they at war?

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.690 align:middle line:84%
How did they then
create peace over time

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
so that we can follow
that same path?

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.267 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
we're a warring race.

00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And we're coming
up with wars over the most

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:90%
ridiculous things.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] You know,
right now we have

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
over 3,000 ballistic
missiles on this planet all

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:90%
aimed back at our own selves.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Not to protect us
from the outside--

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.202 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Enough to destroy
everything on this planet.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: While we're
here without escape pods.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.075 align:middle line:84%
We can't even become
space refugees.

00:11:05.075 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's make reference
on the Gaia series "Ancient

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.985 align:middle line:84%
Civilizations" that I
introduced you with.

00:11:09.985 --> 00:11:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Jack Cary talks about
the Dogon tribe.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a tribe of
people that allegedly

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
had contact with
extraterrestrials who talked

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.400 align:middle line:90%
about a binary star system.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:84%
The only way for them to
know, the Dogon tribe,

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
about this binary
star system was

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
to be told it, because
you couldn't see it.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.432 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's look at that.

00:11:31.432 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: The Dogon
tribe of West Africa

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:10%
were discovered in 1935 by
two French anthropologists.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Griaule and Dieterlen
were their names.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.930 align:middle line:10%
These two anthropologists
eventually

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:10%
gained the respect
of the Dogon shaman

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:10%
and were allowed to hear
their sacred knowledge.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.890 align:middle line:10%
What amazed these
anthropologists

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:10%
was that the Dogon tribe
possessed knowledge

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:10%
of the Sirius star system that
no ancient people should ever

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.770 align:middle line:10%
have possessed.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:12.200 align:middle line:10%
The Dogon tribe told them
that not only was there

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.720 align:middle line:10%
a relationship between
Sirius and our star,

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:10%
but they claimed that a
group of what could only

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:10%
be described as alien creatures
called the Nommos descended

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:10%
down to Earth, and that
this group of beings

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.960 align:middle line:10%
imparted to them the knowledge
that they then possessed

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:10%
about the Sirius star system.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:10%
What they couldn't
understand was

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:10%
how it was they had
knowledge of a Sirius

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:10%
B, which is a white dwarf star.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:10%
It's the smallest form of
visible star that we know of,

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:10%
and we can barely see it
with modern-day telescopes.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:10%
And yet they knew of
its absolute existence,

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:54.590 align:middle line:10%
and they called it Potolo,
which is a tiny seed found

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.970 align:middle line:10%
in West Africa.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:10%
And they said it's a tiny star,
but it's the heaviest thing

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:10%
that there is.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:10%
Well, they were
alluding to the fact

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.020 align:middle line:10%
that white dwarf stars
have some of the highest

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:10%
density of any stellar
bodies that we know of.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:10%
And that's not something
an ancient people should

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.930 align:middle line:10%
have known anything about.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:10%
They even spoke of a Sirius
C, yet another stellar body

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:10%
in the Sirius star
system, something

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:30.440 align:middle line:10%
which wasn't proven to be true
until 1995, a full 60 years

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.910 align:middle line:10%
after the discovery
of this tribe.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely
incredible, Billy, isn't it?

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Incredible.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, somebody
came down and told

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:90%
these people what was going on.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, they did.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.675 align:middle line:84%
Not only did they tell them
about the trinary star system

00:13:43.675 --> 00:13:46.310 align:middle line:84%
at Sirius, but they also
told them about every planet

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:84%
The shape, the size,
and even the colors

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and the orbital
rotation around our sun

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.650 align:middle line:84%
of everything going on right
here in our solar system.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
tribe exist today?

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.228 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, they do.

00:13:57.228 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Those were the original tribe
that lived in the land of Khem,

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.078 align:middle line:90%
long before it was called Egypt.

00:14:02.078 --> 00:14:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And then after, they
were overthrown.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
They were in their own
golden age, so to speak.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And they had no military, no
police officers, no crime.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And some other groups
saw that and took

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.555 align:middle line:84%
advantage of that,
unfortunately,

00:14:14.555 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:90%
and ended their golden age.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.453 align:middle line:84%
They then migrated
out to Mali, Africa,

00:14:17.453 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:90%
where they still live today.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:84%
In the "Star Wars" movie, they
talk about the Jedi Knights.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Those are real, aren't they?

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.292 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They are
100% real, yes.

00:14:27.292 --> 00:14:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where are they from?

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, they're
from the Orion star system.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.460 align:middle line:90%
And so Orion is also Osiris--

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which the pyramids
were constructed after--

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And the alignment to align
with the Orion star system

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:90%
at a specific time frame.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I think it was around
13,000 years ago.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And so basically,
this alignment is just

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:84%
signifying Osiris, which is
one of the very first rulers

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:84%
of the Neteru that
came to Earth.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:84%
They called them the Neteru
in the Egyptian text.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Neteru came
here, and they actually

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.530 align:middle line:84%
turned mud into a kingdom
during the time of Zep Tepi.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
came, the Orion--

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.930 align:middle line:90%
Osiris was also known as Orion.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And he had this initiate
program that he put together

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:84%
for these knights,
these knights of honor,

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:84%
that would carry
these ancient codes

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:84%
of ancient history, ancient
wisdom, ancient knowledge.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And they would use their power
of thought and consciousness

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.825 align:middle line:90%
to defend the galaxy.

00:15:23.825 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'd be great teaching
this in school, you know that?

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: [LAUGHS]

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These Jedi Knights,
are they existing today?

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.867 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: They're here today.

00:15:31.867 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they on our planet?

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.595 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: They're everywhere.

00:15:34.595 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
They are all down, moving
into a resonant awakening

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.670 align:middle line:84%
as we move now into
this galactic equator

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
that our solar system is
moving in resonance with

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and getting all these
galactic, cosmic rays coming

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:90%
from the galactic black hole.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And at this time is
when you're going

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:84%
to start seeing a lot of
people begin to awaken,

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
not only on Earth, but
also in other planets

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.600 align:middle line:90%
in this sector of the galaxy.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.048 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The group
in Mesopotamia,

00:15:58.048 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:90%
they're called the, what?

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.233 align:middle line:90%
The "Abati?"

00:16:00.233 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: The Ubaid culture.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ubaid.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, Ubaid.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.560 align:middle line:10%
The Ubaid culture were
originally space refugees

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:10%
from that ancient, ancient
galactic war from the Pleiades.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:84%
They eventually migrated
to Alpha Draconis,

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:84%
is what we call
that star system.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And some of them actually made
their way from there to Earth.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, they
started their own breakaway

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.850 align:middle line:84%
civilization right
here on Earth,

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.050 align:middle line:84%
long before the
Anunnaki ever arrived,

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:84%
or the Atlantean version
of the Anunnaki that we see

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.160 align:middle line:90%
in the Sumerian--

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they get here, Billy?

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They had
to have space travel.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.240 align:middle line:90%
They had to have star travel.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.660 align:middle line:84%
They had the capability of
traveling obviously faster

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.285 align:middle line:84%
than the speed of
light or a warp drive.

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Some type of a
drive that allowed

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.267 align:middle line:84%
them to violate Einstein's
theory of relativity.

00:16:40.267 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bending space and time.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Creating an Einstein-Rosen
bridge would be one of the ways

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.755 align:middle line:84%
where you actually
literally bend space.

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:47.555 align:middle line:90%
You fold space.

00:16:47.555 --> 00:16:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
walk through it?

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They can
have portal technology.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:90%
That's very possible.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
However, from all the ancient
records that I've read,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
it seems only the
elite of the elite

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:90%
had access to these stargates.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And so you had to have a
special access code, which

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:90%
was a djed pillar ankh.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So your body would resonate to
the specific atomic frequency

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.630 align:middle line:84%
of the condenser
in the djed pillar

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.452 align:middle line:84%
that was harnessed
inside the ankh,

00:17:10.452 --> 00:17:12.619 align:middle line:84%
and that would be your key
to walk through the gate.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:15.202 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't have that specific
resonant frequency programmed

00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:17.599 align:middle line:84%
to the gate, you couldn't get
through to the other side.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gosh, I'd love to have
that kind of technology today.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: We need it.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:21.470 align:middle line:90%
We need it.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Star travel
would be just like that.

00:17:23.345 --> 00:17:24.145 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Instant.

00:17:24.145 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.407 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This culture,
where do they come from?

00:17:27.407 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, they came from
the Alpha Draconis star system,

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.300 align:middle line:84%
but originally started
in the Pleiades.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
They created kingdoms
on Earth, many kingdoms

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:84%
for many thousands-- hundreds
of thousands of years.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:90%
And we actually were here.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Our cousins were here.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Homo sapien cousins were here.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't
Homo sapien sapien,

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:84%
but there was an existing
hominid on this planet

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.360 align:middle line:84%
while those advanced
Alpha Draconian people,

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.370 align:middle line:90%
those Ubaid culture ruled.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.660 align:middle line:90%
They created kingdoms.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.508 align:middle line:84%
They had a monarchical
type of a system.

00:17:55.508 --> 00:17:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
are warring group?

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They weren't
warring at all.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be very peaceful.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.190 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be very peaceful.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They would heal
people, wouldn't they?

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.915 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They
would heal people.

00:18:03.915 --> 00:18:07.040 align:middle line:84%
There were no records of wars
or destruction during their time

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.780 align:middle line:90%
that they reigned.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the Atlantean
Anunnaki showed up.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And then some way,
they just began

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.550 align:middle line:84%
to dissipate and
disappear off the planet.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when you say they
disappeared, where did they go?

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, either
they were killed off,

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they just left, because
the Anunnaki's break away

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:84%
civilization from the
Atlantean culture.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:84%
They really moved into
those areas and regions

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and built their kingdoms
and their new temples

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.378 align:middle line:90%
on top of the Ubaid culture.

00:18:35.378 --> 00:18:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
you say killed off,

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
that means there's
still a warring group

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:90%
out there somewhere, right?

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, well, the
Anunnaki that we know from

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.707 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis are from the--

00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Zecharia Sitchin.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Zecharia
Sitchin, yeah.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:90%
But they also are named.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.968 align:middle line:84%
They're actually named
in the Enuma Elis.

00:18:49.968 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So they're real, and
they were real people.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
However, if you
read those tablets,

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:84%
they're always talking about
using weapons on each other.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And they had several
types of weapons.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.873 align:middle line:84%
They even have this thing
called the Tablets of Destiny.

00:19:01.873 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Whoever owned those
Tablets of Destiny

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.860 align:middle line:84%
can control the power going on
in the center of the galaxy.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So they really were
a warring race.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.435 align:middle line:84%
They had weapons
of mass destruction

00:19:11.435 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that they had even
brought to Earth with them

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.480 align:middle line:90%
and hid inside of a mountain.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's a
wonder we are who we are.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:90%
So they taught us.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:84%
We learned from
them, unfortunately.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
we got this mentality.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Battle, battle, battle.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
battles and wars

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
made it into the
Book of Deuteronomy.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:84%
The wars in the
Book of Deuteronomy

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.550 align:middle line:84%
were ordered by these
Anunnaki Atlantean people.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think that
with a higher civilization,

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:84%
an advanced civilization,
that they would be more

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:90%
peaceful and understanding.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case, is it?

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's not the case.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:90%
There were some good ones, too.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:90%
So you had Thoth.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:90%
You had some very good Enki.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.870 align:middle line:84%
You had some very
good people in there.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.828 align:middle line:84%
But also, you always have
the yin and the yang.

00:19:52.828 --> 00:19:53.628 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:19:53.628 --> 00:19:54.590 align:middle line:90%
The balance.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:90%
The balance.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.677 align:middle line:84%
We always hope that
the good will prevail.

00:19:57.677 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of good that
came out of some of the things

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.920 align:middle line:84%
that they did, and a lot of good
energy and a lot of good people

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:84%
that tried to uplift
mankind and take it

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.580 align:middle line:90%
to another level consciously.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But also then
unfortunately, we did have

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:90%
the infighting of themselves.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
They were fighting against
their own family members

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:84%
for control of the people
and resources of Earth.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.475 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you come
across this knowledge, Billy?

00:20:19.475 --> 00:20:21.000 align:middle line:90%
You know a lot about this.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I know.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, around 2010, I started
looking into space anomalies.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I recognized
some of these anomalies

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
appeared to match some of the
megalithic structures on Earth.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:84%
These were images from
NASA, the European Space

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Agency, the Russian Space
Agency, and so forth,

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:84%
looking at Mars,
the moon, Venus.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Even looking at the
moons of Saturn.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And I started recognizing
things that just didn't belong.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm like, if
this looks like that

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and we have this here on Earth,
and this looks like our thesis,

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
could this be the
same ancient culture?

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they were--

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You started piecing
things and putting two and two

00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So I
started researching.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.140 align:middle line:84%
I started digging into ancient
texts, ancient tablets.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Long story short, I've gone
through over a million cylinder

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:84%
scrolls, tablets,
texts, cuneiform

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.560 align:middle line:90%
stones, cylinder scrolls.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you name it, I've
gone through them all.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you are
convinced about what now?

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.980 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: I am totally convinced
that a interplanetary, maybe

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:10%
even intergalactic race,
came through our area,

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:10%
engaged mankind, created
multiple breakaway

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:10%
civilizations in this
sector of the galaxy,

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:10%
and ruled for probably millions
of years before it collapsed.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they seed us?

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I believe
that we were seeded

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
based on my conversations
with the Aboriginal elders

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.877 align:middle line:90%
when I went to Australia.

00:21:37.877 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:90%
I believe that they were--

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've been everywhere.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.362 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I've been
everywhere, yeah.

00:21:41.362 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
They said that we
were seeded here.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:84%
We were the first people
seeded on this planet

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:90%
by the Pleiadians.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And so also I believe
that our cousins,

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:84%
before we were
genetically modified,

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
were also seeded here during
the time of those wars that

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:90%
were going on.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.300 align:middle line:84%
It was a preservation
type of a thing,

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.883 align:middle line:84%
just like we preserve--
unfortunately,

00:21:59.883 --> 00:22:01.383 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to use
the name animal.

00:22:01.383 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But we preserve animals by
taking them and moving them

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
to different areas
on the planet.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In our solar
system, is there

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.100 align:middle line:84%
anything unusual about any of
the planets in your opinion?

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yes, a lot
of unusual things.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
way that our moon

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.050 align:middle line:84%
is geostationary locked
with the rotation of Earth.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
The distance from
the Earth to the moon

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:90%
allows it to create a perfect--

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, it
was perfect design.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.470 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And then when you look at the
way that the moon was created,

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:84%
you look at all those
different craters.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't see any craters
that have hit at an angle

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and then skid to
a particular spot.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Everything seems to
be direct head on.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.907 align:middle line:84%
And they always
have the same depth,

00:22:45.907 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:90%
which is very interesting.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like it's carved out.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you have-- around the
rims of a lot of these craters,

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.412 align:middle line:84%
it's missing a lot of the
debris from the center.

00:22:53.412 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Where'd the debris go?

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So it makes you ask a
question, like, is this thing--

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.930 align:middle line:84%
are these real craters, or
are these artificial domes

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
that are being
hidden from our eyes

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.770 align:middle line:90%
with some type of technology?

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
dropped the ascent module

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:84%
back into the moon during
the Apollo missions

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and they had the
seismometers on the surface,

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.150 align:middle line:84%
it rang like a bell
for over an hour.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It pinged.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Now what backs this
up, more recently,

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.330 align:middle line:84%
just about five years
ago, we did a ground

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:26.100 align:middle line:84%
penetrating radar scan of
the moon using the Arecibo

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:26.900 align:middle line:90%
telescope.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Before it collapsed.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Before
it collapsed, yes.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle line:10%
And so with the
Arecibo telescope,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.620 align:middle line:10%
we were able to see beneath
the surface of the moon.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And what we see in
those images untouched

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.180 align:middle line:84%
appear to be what looks like
metallic or support beams

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:90%
underneath the surface.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:23:45.045 --> 00:23:47.440 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little boy, my
parents got me a telescope,

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and one of the first objects,
Billy, I looked at was Saturn.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:90%
And I could see the rings.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
It was like somebody painted
this perfect picture out

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:90%
in space.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:84%
On the Gaia show "Deep
Space," David Icke

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:84%
talks about the interesting
facts surrounding

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.098 align:middle line:90%
that planet, Saturn.

00:24:04.098 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: The more we
learn about the planet Saturn,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:10%
the stranger it becomes.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:10%
The spacecraft
"Cassini" has fallen

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:14.380 align:middle line:10%
into the atmosphere of Saturn
in its last great adventure.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:10%
With "Cassini" now gone, we'll
have no more visual access

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.250 align:middle line:10%
to the planet outside
of our telescopes.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:10%
But what if the planet is
something different than what

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.940 align:middle line:10%
we are told?

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:84%
In mythology, we discover
many stories of Saturn

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.060 align:middle line:84%
being a controlling
god, a fearful god who

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.040 align:middle line:90%
murders his children.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is also Father
of Time with his scythe.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is also associated
with Satan, the Dark Lord

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.040 align:middle line:90%
of Western mythology.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Is Saturn somehow
controlling us?

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID ICKE: If you can change
the information source that

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:10%
people are decoding--

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:10%
i.e.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:84%
you broadcast it from
Saturn with a heck

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of amplification
from the moon--

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:03.820 align:middle line:84%
then you can change the reality,
physical, actually holographic

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.470 align:middle line:90%
that people are decoding.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:10%
If you've got the headset on in
a video game and someone puts

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.070 align:middle line:10%
another disk in, your
reality completely

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:10%
changes, because now you're
decoding another information

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:10%
source.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:10%
That is what I say
happened, and that's

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:10%
what changed this reality from
something that was described

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:10%
in blissful, harmonious
terms into the madhouse

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.237 align:middle line:10%
that we have today
called human society.

00:25:29.237 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you agree
with him, Billy?

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.153 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's very interesting.

00:25:32.153 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a great perspective
to think about,

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.285 align:middle line:84%
the fact that I
really do believe

00:25:35.285 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that we're living in a
fractal holographic universe.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So what he's alluding
to is the fact

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that somehow Saturn
energetically

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.460 align:middle line:84%
has some type of a
programming effect

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:84%
on the actual hologram
or this light matrix

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.103 align:middle line:90%
that we're inhabiting.

00:25:50.103 --> 00:25:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
say that Saturn

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.737 align:middle line:84%
may be one of the most unusual
planets in our solar system?

00:25:54.737 --> 00:25:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, yeah, it is.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the more I
looked into Saturn,

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.618 align:middle line:84%
the more I realized--
first of all,

00:25:58.618 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:84%
it has a hexagon on top that's
a perfect shape hexagon.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The rings
are fantastic.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.263 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: The rings are amazing.

00:26:04.263 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But there's a book that came
out called the "Ringmakers

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.680 align:middle line:90%
of Saturn" by Norman Bergrun.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And that book took me
down a big rabbit hole

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.170 align:middle line:84%
when I started
analyzing these images.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.797 align:middle line:84%
And this man's credentials
are down the street

00:26:16.797 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:90%
and around the corner, you know?

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're impeccable.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Impeccable.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that there
looks to be sophisticated--

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:84%
what I would call man-made
structures or advanced

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:84%
being-made structures sitting
on top of these rings,

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and also some things that look
like they're actually guiding

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:90%
the rings in certain ways--

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.797 align:middle line:84%
is there a civilization that
lives on the rings of Saturn?

00:26:37.797 --> 00:26:38.672 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't know.

00:26:38.672 --> 00:26:39.820 align:middle line:90%
But it's really amazing.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But I did find some
interesting things

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.845 align:middle line:84%
on Titan, which is one
of the moons there.

00:26:43.845 --> 00:26:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
you find there?

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.412 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: An actual
anomaly, a massive anomaly

00:26:48.412 --> 00:26:50.620 align:middle line:84%
with the descent of the
Huygens probe to the surface,

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:84%
which landed in what
looks like a lake.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.673 align:middle line:84%
They're claiming that it's
hydrocarbons that are--

00:26:55.673 --> 00:26:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And methanes.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, and methane.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.470 align:middle line:84%
But they're saying it's so
dense that it looks like water,

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.270 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it is.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.110 align:middle line:90%
But however--

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've got to go there.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: We have to go there.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:07.630 align:middle line:84%
On the descent, though, it
picked up some amazing images,

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:84%
which we'll probably get a
chance to show a clip of that.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:84%
An amazing anomaly I found,
which is super massive.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Probably about a mile
high on the surface.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A mile high?

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: A mile high.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.095 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, it's massive.

00:27:20.095 --> 00:27:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't look to be--

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's a
structure made by someone?

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.937 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't look like a rock.

00:27:24.937 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like
anything that would be-- say,

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:84%
geologically would
be normal form.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.690 align:middle line:84%
It looks like something that
was made by intelligent hands.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we've got
rovers running all over Mars,

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.560 align:middle line:90%
looking for things.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Have they found
anything in your opinion

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.382 align:middle line:84%
that we really
should be looking at?

00:27:41.382 --> 00:27:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think they've
found a lot of stuff,

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.100 align:middle line:84%
which is why they have spent
trillions and trillions

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:46.900 align:middle line:90%
of dollars--

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.820 align:middle line:84%
it's more than billions
by now, it's actually

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.805 align:middle line:90%
trillions-- to go to Mars.

00:27:50.805 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chunk of
change for what

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:90%
they've been spending, right?

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, it's just peanuts.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's just-- you know.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.717 align:middle line:84%
You just press a button
and you print more.

00:27:56.717 --> 00:27:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Print more money.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's very easy
for them to do.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.960 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] They just
have to justify it.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But even with all the failed
missions, we keep going back.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.217 align:middle line:84%
Now we have Curiosity
Rover, which

00:28:07.217 --> 00:28:08.467 align:middle line:90%
has been up there for a while.

00:28:08.467 --> 00:28:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And we also have the
Mars Perseverance Rover--

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which
just got up there.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And the images coming back
from the Perseverance Rover

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:18.910 align:middle line:84%
have already shown incredible,
incredible anomalies.

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Unquestionable.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And these are some of the main
images that they've posted,

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and they put it right
on the main website.

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Everybody just takes a glance.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.460 align:middle line:90%
They go, oh, that's cool.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Nobody takes the
image and goes, let

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:90%
me take a closer look at this.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll start
to see things that

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.297 align:middle line:84%
have geometric shapes,
things that are--

00:28:34.297 --> 00:28:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they do,
Billy, and they just

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:90%
don't want us to know about it.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's possible.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes they just
hide the truth in plain sight.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:40.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you're
right about that.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm fascinated by the
ancient civilizations

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that talked
about intergalactic races.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.802 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Talk about that.

00:28:52.802 --> 00:28:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: If you look into
the ancient Indian epics--

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:84%
the Mahabharata,
the Bhagavad Gita--

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:84%
they actually talk about
intergalactic races

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:84%
specifically coming
from the Pleiades.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So again-- and some
of these records

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.670 align:middle line:84%
are really super
ancient and have been

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.050 align:middle line:90%
re-copied many, many times.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So just somebody
saying, oh, they're

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:84%
2,000 or 3,000 or
4,000 years old, no.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.800 align:middle line:90%
They're much older than that.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hundreds
of thousands of--

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And then when you look into the
Emerald Tablets of Thoth, which

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:27.070 align:middle line:84%
are about 36,000
years old estimated,

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.530 align:middle line:84%
the first thing they talk
about is getting in a ship

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and flying into space and
coming down to the Earth,

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.470 align:middle line:84%
to the land of Khem after
the great flood happened.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the opening scene
in the Emerald Tablets.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So this is
really amazing stuff.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And the deeper you look, you
start finding the Sumerian

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.210 align:middle line:84%
tablets now, the Akkadian,
the Babylonian versions

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.550 align:middle line:84%
are all talking about
these advanced beings

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.520 align:middle line:84%
coming from space to Earth
and interacting or engaging

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.840 align:middle line:90%
mankind in some way.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:84%
In more modern times,
you can find it

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.980 align:middle line:84%
in the Torah, the
mention of the Pleiades.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.600 align:middle line:84%
In the modern-day
Bible, you find

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.670 align:middle line:90%
it mentioned, Homer's "Iliad."

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can just--
the Greek mythology.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.480 align:middle line:90%
I can just keep going and going.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Knowing what you know,
does it excite you?

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Does it baffle you?

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Does it scare you?

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.790 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It really excites me.

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I really feel like
I'm not small anymore.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:18.820 align:middle line:90%
I feel massive.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:90%
I feel super massive.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Some people may think,
oh, man, it just

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:22.960 align:middle line:90%
means that we're nothing.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that it makes me
feel so great and big to be

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:84%
interconnected with all
this stuff in the universe.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And my main goal or mission is
to find out, how much more can

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.350 align:middle line:90%
I learn?

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And is there any
way that I can even

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:36.100 align:middle line:84%
get to see some of this stuff
in my lifetime potentially?

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close do you
get to the theory of God

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.230 align:middle line:90%
when you investigate all this?

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, it's
a great question.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that
there is a God, a creator,

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.987 align:middle line:84%
because when you look at the
science of what we're living

00:30:47.987 --> 00:30:49.195 align:middle line:90%
in, this holographic matrix--

00:30:49.195 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's
a genius design.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's
definitely designed,

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.570 align:middle line:84%
and so that means
there is a designer.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I just don't believe that
the designer is inside

00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:58.662 align:middle line:90%
the matrix with us.

00:30:58.662 --> 00:31:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the designer's
on the outside of the matrix.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looking in?

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.875 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Looking in.

00:31:02.875 --> 00:31:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Just like if I had an ant farm,
I can look at the ant farm

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.530 align:middle line:90%
from the outside looking in.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I can manipulate
things in the farm.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:11.480 align:middle line:90%
I can change things.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:90%
I can add food.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.005 align:middle line:90%
I can take food away.

00:31:13.005 --> 00:31:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I can take sand away.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Whatever I want, I can
manipulate their environment.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.597 align:middle line:84%
I'm the god to them
on the outside.

00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:20.180 align:middle line:10%
And so I believe
that what's happening

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.690 align:middle line:10%
in a lot of religious
texts, they've

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.350 align:middle line:10%
mistaken people that have
masqueraded as gods because

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.810 align:middle line:10%
of their advanced technology
and their advanced knowledge

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:10%
and put them as the deity
instead of understanding

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.623 align:middle line:10%
that there's something even
above them that really truly

00:31:34.623 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:10%
is the creator of all.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.707 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was a kid,
I had an ant farm, Billy.

00:31:37.707 --> 00:31:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to see how quickly
they could always rebuild.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I would always
shake the ant farm

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and watch them again
put everything together.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Carbon copy from what they have.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd shake it again,
and they do it again and again

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:53.410 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a little like what
we do on this planet.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.830 align:middle line:84%
If you take a look at a city
and you just take an open frame

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.550 align:middle line:84%
video and then you speed it up,
it looks just like an ant farm.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:90%
We look like we're the ants.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.358 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot of these
advanced civilizations that I

00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:08.950 align:middle line:84%
think are really
visiting us, they're

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.670 align:middle line:84%
just monitoring us, just like
if we monitor animals out

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.170 align:middle line:84%
in the wild, in
the wilderness now.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:15.463 align:middle line:90%
We sit back and we just watch.

00:32:15.463 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:84%
We hide cameras around
and we just watch them.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And through anthropology,
we learn about them.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.005 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that they're
doing the same thing with us.

00:32:23.005 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
your trip to Australia

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.410 align:middle line:90%
and what you uncovered there.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, that
trip was mind-blowing.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I came on your show
maybe two shows ago,

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and I talked about the fact that
there were Egyptian hieroglyphs

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:36.250 align:middle line:90%
out in the outback of Australia.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In Australia
of all places.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And I finally got a
chance to get out there.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And I got some Aboriginal
elders and some guides,

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and I went out way out to
the-- miles out into the bush,

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.010 align:middle line:90%
into the fires.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
beginning of 2020

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:84%
before the lockdown
happened, so I

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.240 align:middle line:84%
was happy I was able
to get out there.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And they took me
to, after some time,

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.048 align:middle line:84%
these proto Egyptian hieroglyphs
and also these Pleiadian

00:33:01.048 --> 00:33:02.590 align:middle line:84%
hieroglyphs out
there in the Outback.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.958 align:middle line:84%
And the Indigenous
people say what?

00:33:06.958 --> 00:33:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They say that the
Pleiadians have been coming

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:12.220 align:middle line:84%
here for hundreds of
thousands of years,

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and that the Egyptians were
coming across and coming

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:18.245 align:middle line:84%
there to learn wisdom from
the Aboriginal elders.

00:33:18.245 --> 00:33:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.328 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Just amazing stuff.

00:33:20.328 --> 00:33:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And these glyphs
have now been dated

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:26.080 align:middle line:84%
because of the growth inside
of the cracks or the curves--

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how did you come
across these Egyptian glyphs?

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Initially, I
saw the Strong family.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.670 align:middle line:84%
It was Evan Strong
and Steve Strong.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:34.805 align:middle line:90%
It's a father and son team.

00:33:34.805 --> 00:33:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Researchers?

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, researchers.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.140 align:middle line:84%
They were just out
there in the bush.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.840 align:middle line:84%
They had heard about
them from the elders,

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and they went out and found
the location where these were.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
talking about them,

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.223 align:middle line:84%
it was a story of-- one
of the glyphs was a story.

00:33:48.223 --> 00:33:50.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the lines of the glyphs--
because they would come and put

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.400 align:middle line:84%
their stories in lines over
many, many years, thousands

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.200 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.658 align:middle line:84%
And this one story
was interesting,

00:33:55.658 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:84%
because two brothers
came from Egypt.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.150 align:middle line:84%
When they landed and
came up to the area

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:02.870 align:middle line:84%
to meet up with the Aboriginals,
one brother got bit by a snake.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, god.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Like a rattlesnake?

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: A rattlesnake or
some type of jungle snake.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:90%
Right away.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like, they just got there.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:10.960 align:middle line:90%
And he tried to save him.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So the table that he used
to try to save him is there.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:17.349 align:middle line:84%
The stone he kind of made
it into a makeshift table--

00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:18.310 align:middle line:90%
surgery table, right?

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:19.300 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:23.220 align:middle line:84%
He ended up using that stone
to actually mummify him.

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He died.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: He died.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.632 align:middle line:90%
And he left that in the glyphs.

00:34:25.632 --> 00:34:27.460 align:middle line:90%
And he took him back to Egypt.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.530 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Egypt
in 2014, the story

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:31.780 align:middle line:84%
of him returning from
Australia with his brother,

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.880 align:middle line:84%
his dead brother, was
there in the glyphs.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.469 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it was like,
I have to go to Australia.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:38.469 align:middle line:84%
And I finally got a chance
to make it out there.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:40.594 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You gave us some
pictures about your trip.

00:34:40.594 --> 00:34:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at them.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.659 align:middle line:84%
And tell us what
we're looking at, OK?

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:44.459 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:34:44.459 --> 00:34:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A couple of them.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:47.239 align:middle line:90%
What is this, Billy?

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: This is the actual
location of the glyphs.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.699 align:middle line:84%
We're in this crevice where
they had this makeshift temple.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:55.489 align:middle line:84%
The roof has now been
long since deteriorated.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we're in this
crevice area way

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.807 align:middle line:84%
out there, miles
out in the Outback.

00:34:59.807 --> 00:35:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a little--

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:84%
some humans down in
the corner, right?

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, that's my team
that was down there, actually.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.482 align:middle line:10%
I think that looks
like it might even

00:35:06.482 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:10%
be Steven Strong, one of the
Strong family that was there

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:10.770 align:middle line:10%
with me.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we were out there, and
they got me to this location.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.592 align:middle line:84%
You can clearly
see these glyphs.

00:35:15.592 --> 00:35:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
with these glyphs,

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.758 align:middle line:84%
there's actually
a section where it

00:35:18.758 --> 00:35:21.200 align:middle line:84%
looks like a flying saucer
with little saucers coming out

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.960 align:middle line:90%
of the bottom of it.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.170 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty amazing stuff.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.692 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at the next picture.

00:35:26.692 --> 00:35:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: This side
here, these are

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.650 align:middle line:84%
some of the Pleiadian
glyphs which

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.720 align:middle line:90%
have not been deciphered yet.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.310 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Aboriginal elders,

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:37.600 align:middle line:84%
these glyphs were made and left
by Pleiadian elders and people

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.560 align:middle line:90%
that have come for--

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
carved away at that?

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.615 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, they carved
away and etched away at that.

00:35:42.615 --> 00:35:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So in between those cracks
and crevices of the glyphs,

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:48.100 align:middle line:84%
you get a patina and other
organic material that grows,

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.305 align:middle line:90%
and that can be dated.

00:35:49.305 --> 00:35:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How tall
is that, Billy?

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's about
60 to 70 feet tall.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That big?

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.278 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's massive.

00:35:56.278 --> 00:35:57.653 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty tall
stuff out there.

00:35:57.653 --> 00:35:58.453 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:58.453 --> 00:35:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Pretty high.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.038 align:middle line:84%
You have to climb up
on different rocks

00:36:01.038 --> 00:36:02.080 align:middle line:90%
to see the higher levels.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:84%
In some areas, you
can't even get up there.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.337 align:middle line:84%
So nobody knows how-- it's
such a very tight area.

00:36:07.337 --> 00:36:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows how
they were able to get

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:84%
to the highest parts of that
cliff to etch those glyphs.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now those symbols or
pictures, what do they depict?

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Those are
pictographs or hieroglyphs.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:23.290 align:middle line:84%
They depict ideas and concepts
typically is what they depict.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But because they
can't be deciphered--

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and the people who knew what
they meant are long gone.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.543 align:middle line:84%
But according to the Aboriginal
elders, those are Pleiadian.

00:36:32.543 --> 00:36:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at our last picture.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.940 align:middle line:90%


00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Again, just
more glyphs here.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:84%
These are proto
Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And so these glyphs were
verified by the Board

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:49.150 align:middle line:90%
of Antiquities of Egypt.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how big
is this structure here?

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: This one here is
probably only about-- maybe

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:54.980 align:middle line:90%
six feet tall.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's like a doorway.

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.130 align:middle line:90%
Really amazing.

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That looks like
an animal down there

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom, doesn't it?

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.168 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, it kind of
looks like an animal down there.

00:37:05.168 --> 00:37:06.233 align:middle line:90%
They depict stories.

00:37:06.233 --> 00:37:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Primarily what they
were talking about--

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.483 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the interactions that
they had when they came to this

00:37:10.483 --> 00:37:13.820 align:middle line:84%
area, when they came across who
they talked to, what they did,

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:14.620 align:middle line:90%
what interaction--

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.967 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old is that, Billy?

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: These were
around 5,000 years old.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And they could be dated
because inside the crevices

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.350 align:middle line:84%
of the glyphs, the patina and
the other organic material

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:25.670 align:middle line:84%
has been dated back
to about 5,000 years.

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look at how straight
the chisel lines are.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's incredible.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like they were made
with some type of a machine.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.020 align:middle line:90%
And you can see machine--

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like they
cut it out, yeah.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.085 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, there's some
machine marks left behind.

00:37:36.085 --> 00:37:37.593 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like it
was drilled out.

00:37:37.593 --> 00:37:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It was drilled
out, or some type of laser.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows exactly how,
but it's very, very accurate.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Egyptian
glyphs in Australia.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
that tell you?

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.188 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It tells me
we've got a lot to learn.

00:37:51.188 --> 00:37:54.740 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] What we thought
we knew, forget about it.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:58.220 align:middle line:84%
There was an interplanetary
civilization,

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.850 align:middle line:90%
maybe even intergalactic.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:00.650 align:middle line:90%
They came here.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
here, they weren't just

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:90%
in one region or this region.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis wasn't
just a ring city.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis was the entire planet.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they went around
this entire planet,

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:84%
interacting with different
Indigenous cultures,

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:84%
learning from them, teaching
them, building civilizations.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:84%
In the Emerald Tablets,
Thoth tells his crew

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.810 align:middle line:84%
after they rebuild the
land of Khem, which is now

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.480 align:middle line:84%
known as Egypt, he
brings them back up

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.730 align:middle line:84%
to a high level of civilization
after the great flood.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.272 align:middle line:84%
So that means at one point, they
were already at a high level

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:29.310 align:middle line:90%
before the flood.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And then he tells his
crew, go around the planet

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and duplicate this,
what we just did here.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is so special
about planet Earth, Billy?

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
what's special is

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.970 align:middle line:84%
we're out in the boondocks
in our Milky Way Galaxy.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.520 align:middle line:84%
We're in this area on one
of the outer rings that

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.650 align:middle line:90%
was dropped into this location.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:47.550 align:middle line:84%
When scientists
look into the sky

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:50.278 align:middle line:84%
now, that swath of stars
going across in the night sky

00:38:50.278 --> 00:38:52.070 align:middle line:84%
that they thought was
part of the Milky Way

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.930 align:middle line:90%
is actually not the Milky Way.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:84%
It's something called the
Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Not the Sagittarius
Constellation.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.770 align:middle line:84%
That's something
totally different.

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:02.600 align:middle line:90%
The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is another galaxy
much smaller than ours

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that actually merged with
the Milky Way Galaxy,

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's being gobbled
and swallowed up.

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And where they found
at the intersect point

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.970 align:middle line:84%
where that swath drops right
down into the Milky Way

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:15.660 align:middle line:90%
is exactly where we're located.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So our solar system,
our planet, everything

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.000 align:middle line:84%
here in this particular
sector of space

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.220 align:middle line:84%
comes from a whole
nother galaxy.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.345 align:middle line:90%
We ourselves are aliens.

00:39:24.345 --> 00:39:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.237 align:middle line:84%
What other evidence is out
there of ancient races?

00:39:28.237 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Well, there's so much.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.543 align:middle line:84%
Besides all the ancient
text, we obviously

00:39:31.543 --> 00:39:32.960 align:middle line:84%
have all the
megalithic structures

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that have been left
all over the planet.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.888 align:middle line:84%
And so no matter where
you go on this planet,

00:39:37.888 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find
megalithic structures.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we even found
pyramids in Australia.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:44.360 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't even aware of that.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.040 align:middle line:84%
That was something
new to me, OK?

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Pyramids were in Australia.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.898 align:middle line:84%
And then also, but
look off the planet.

00:39:49.898 --> 00:39:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some of
the space probe data.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:52.648 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the moon.

00:39:52.648 --> 00:39:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Why are there
pyramids on the moon?

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Why are there areas on the moon
that look just like Giza where

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.720 align:middle line:90%
the Sphinx is located?

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Then you move on to Mars.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Again, you find more of
these duplicated-type stones.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:06.140 align:middle line:84%
You find the same
stones on Mars,

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.540 align:middle line:84%
the same way built,
the structures

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:13.100 align:middle line:84%
built that you do in the Mayan
civilizations of South America

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.960 align:middle line:84%
where you have the
Chichen Itza and you have

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.820 align:middle line:90%
Peru and all these other areas.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:18.510 align:middle line:84%
You find the same
exact techniques,

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.910 align:middle line:90%
building techniques there.

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:22.165 align:middle line:84%
It's really amazing how
no matter where you look,

00:40:22.165 --> 00:40:23.540 align:middle line:84%
we're finding
similarities, which

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.610 align:middle line:90%
means there's one architect.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's next
for Billy Carson?

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Oh, so much stuff.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.980 align:middle line:10%
You know, obviously,
the situation

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.740 align:middle line:10%
we had with the
planetary shutdown

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.240 align:middle line:10%
stopped me from a
lot of my travels.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.160 align:middle line:10%
But moving into this
year, I'm heading out

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.757 align:middle line:10%
to document the Lalibela
temples and the Kailash temples.

00:40:40.757 --> 00:40:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't stop, do you?

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, I can't stop.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:44.030 align:middle line:90%
There's too much to do here.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.947 align:middle line:90%
There's just too much.

00:40:44.947 --> 00:40:47.208 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your
favorite region of the planet?

00:40:47.208 --> 00:40:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: My favorite region
right now still is Africa.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.010 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
hidden jewels there.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.578 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm not the only one--

00:40:53.578 --> 00:40:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
cradle of civilization.

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's one of them.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I think-- well, Mesopotamia
is really part of Africa.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It used to be part of Africa.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Now it's been sectioned
off where now that's Iraq

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.940 align:middle line:90%
and this is Africa.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.170 align:middle line:84%

the Middle East.

In ancient times,

you do remarkable work.

>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were a
teacher and you were teaching

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:17.090 align:middle line:84%
young people about
all these things

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and some little kid
comes up to you and goes,

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Carson, do extraterrestrials
really visit us, how

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.000 align:middle line:90%
would you tell him yes?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I would say,
not only do they visit us,

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.060 align:middle line:84%
but there are probably
some here right now,

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.310 align:middle line:90%
and you wouldn't even know it.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:32.120 align:middle line:90%

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

>>NOORY: Fascinating
discussion with a man

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.770 align:middle line:10%
who believes we've been
visited by extraterrestrials,

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.130 align:middle line:10%
and he's telling our
planet that it's happening.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:44.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
