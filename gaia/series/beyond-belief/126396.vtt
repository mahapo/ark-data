>>GEORGE NOORY: And welcome
back to another edition

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:10%
This subject may
scare you, so I just

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.440 align:middle line:10%
want to warn you ahead of time.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Dr. John Hall is
our special guest.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a listen to
some of the things he has done.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: He fights tirelessly
for victims of an unseen enemy,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:90%
organized gang stalkers.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Dr. John Hall explains
how criminal gangs

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
use government satellites
to penetrate an individual's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:90%
thoughts and drive him crazy.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:84%
But unlike many who've dismissed
the victims of organized

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:84%
stalking, Dr. Hall has
tried to reassure them

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
the attackers are actually
the ones who are mentally ill.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hall provides tips on how
to spot organized stalking

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:90%
and how to fight back.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.548 align:middle line:90%
Today on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And of
course, Dr. John Hall

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.190 align:middle line:10%
is extremely busy,
because his latest

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:10%
book is called "Guinea Pigs."

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, it deals with
this stalking and electronic

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:90%
surveillance of people.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle line:84%
John, this is a subject
that so many people are

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:84%
fascinated with, yet they
really aren't that aware of it.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you're
doing this for us.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.362 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN HALL: Well,
I'm glad to be on.

00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:10%
And this is affecting we think
up to 300,000 people in the US,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.032 align:middle line:10%
even more than that globally.

00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:84%
You're one of the
few people that's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:84%
actually helped touch on it and
help expose it to the public.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, a lot of
people just don't get it.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about they're
being electronically surveyed

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
or they're being stalked, they
probably say, oh, come on.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to watch
me or check into me.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:10%
>>HALL: And that's why they
get away with it so easily.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Because the common question that
most of these victims get is,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:90%
why you?

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Why would anybody be
spending this kind of money

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:90%
to surveil you?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line
is experimentation.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that reads "Guinea
Pigs," by the time you finish

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that book, if you don't believe
that the US government does

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.708 align:middle line:84%
have non-consensual
experimentation programs,

00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:84%
then there's something
wrong with you

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're probably
never going to believe.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But there has never been
successful legislation

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:84%
passed in this country
to prevent the government

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:84%
from experimenting on
the public, whether it's

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:84%
with radiation back
in the '40s and '50s

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
or now with directed energy
weapons in the 2000s.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think Congress
is aware of what's going on?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Congress is aware.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I know Senator John
Glenn had tried

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.020 align:middle line:84%
to pass legislation
making informed

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
consent with any type of
government experimentation law

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.390 align:middle line:90%
and it was shot down.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
bill that was tried

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:84%
to pass to help the
Space Preservation

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Treaty to make all the countries
agree to not weaponize space.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
That was written
by Dennis Kucinich.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And specifically in
that bill were the terms

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:84%
psychotronic weaponry,
weaponry that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
will bind to the
human nervous system,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
cause anger, cause aggression,
manipulate the senses.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.553 align:middle line:90%
That language was in the bill.

00:03:08.553 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:84%
By time the bill actually
made it to Congress,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.030 align:middle line:84%
that language had
been stricken out

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and then the bill was
shot down in its entirety.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's get definitions
for the two different types

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.170 align:middle line:84%
of things you've
been working on.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:84%
First of all, all of us know
what the word stalking means,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
But tell us what your
definition of stalking is.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Well, this
type of stalking

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
is the old term
was gang stalking.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:84%
The new term is
organized stalking.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is stalking by
a group of individuals

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.930 align:middle line:84%
unknown to you that inundate
you at home, at work, everywhere

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
you go, monitoring your emails,
monitoring your phone calls.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.267 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a scorned loved one
or an ex-husband or ex-wife.

00:03:48.267 --> 00:03:49.892 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or somebody
obsessed with you.

00:03:49.892 --> 00:03:51.475 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Or somebody
obsessed with you.

00:03:51.475 --> 00:03:53.550 align:middle line:84%
These are trained
government operatives,

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
whether they're subcontractors
or directly working

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:84%
for the government,
that are not only

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.810 align:middle line:84%
gathering information
but stalking you,

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
at least we think, to
get biometric parameters

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:90%
on the victim.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Because once the
stalking tails off,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:84%
then the electronic
harassment begins.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now,
electronic harassment.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Electronic
harassment, usually

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
most people notice it first
with emails disappearing,

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.130 align:middle line:84%
lights turning off
and on in their home,

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
radios turning off and on
in their home on their own,

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
garage doors
opening and closing,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
garage lights going on
and off on their own.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
In San Antonio, we had
an entire neighborhood

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that were voicing complaints
that their garage doors were

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:33.803 align:middle line:90%
opening and closing.

00:04:33.803 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Their car wiring was going awry.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have two NSA
bases in San Antonio now.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And it took a year
before they came forward,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
but eventually the
NSA said, well,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:84%
we're experimenting with a
new ground wave technology.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:84%
But this one neighborhood
seemed to be chosen

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:90%
to get all of these effects.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know if it
was truly experimentation

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:84%
with a communication system
or were they experimenting

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:90%
on the neighborhood itself.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, are they
coming by in these vans?

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:84%
We always see them
in Hollywood movies

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:84%
where they're all in this
van with all this equipment

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and monitoring and
things like that.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.845 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Sometimes the
stalking does start that way.

00:05:09.845 --> 00:05:11.220 align:middle line:84%
The boots on the
ground stalking,

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:84%
you will notice people in
cars or groups of people

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:90%
taking turns following you.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
But then that trails
off and the rest of it

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:84%
seems to be either positive wind
tower, cell tower, or satellite

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle line:90%
based.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Because the stalking trails off
and the electronic harassment

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:90%
follows you everywhere you go.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here's the question.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Why do this to general
Americans, middle class

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Americans?

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.418 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Well, I
think eventually they

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.260 align:middle line:84%
want a way to control the
population, at least decision

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:84%
making of the
population as a whole.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.880 align:middle line:84%
If you look back on
experimentation in the past,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.270 align:middle line:84%
whether it was MKUltra
or radiation experiments,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:84%
bacterial radioactive iodide
that they floated clouds over

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:84%
to see if it would
cause thyroid cancer.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
these experiments,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:84%
they were done on
the common people.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The common folks,
they don't have

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
the money or the political
clout to do anything about this.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We know they
have equipment now

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:84%
where they can look at
your house from the outside

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and they know exactly
where you are in the house.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:90%
They can see you.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Yeah.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:84%
That's Forward Looking
Infrared, FLIR.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the old
days, like you remember

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.460 align:middle line:84%
"Terminator" or some
of these old movies

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:84%
where they would
show a thermal print

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and it was a swirl
of blue and yellow.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's not anymore.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
thermal imaging now,

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a black
and white photo.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%
They can see exactly
where you are

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
in a room, which means they can
also anatomically attack you

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
correctly with other satellite
based directed energy weapons.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just amazing
the technology

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:84%
that we're really
not aware of that we

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.190 align:middle line:90%
must have as a government.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: And even
the Russians were

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:90%
the first to come out with it.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Putin has actually mentioned
the term psychotronic weaponry

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:90%
in statements that he's put out.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Actually made the comment
that whichever country

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.510 align:middle line:84%
has the best
psychotronic weapons

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.827 align:middle line:84%
will control the globe
without bullets or missiles.

00:07:03.827 --> 00:07:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's right.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:90%
He's right.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember, and we're
talking 20 years ago,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.130 align:middle line:84%
that the Russians would
bombard our embassies

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.960 align:middle line:90%
with listening devices.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So they would be able to
hear what was going on

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:90%
inside the embassy.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Yeah, they call
that the woodpecker signal.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And that was when
Nixon was in office

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and they noticed that he would
have emotional breakdowns when

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.975 align:middle line:90%
he was at that embassy.

00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And they found out that it
was a woodpecker signal.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Interesting thing with
that is that disappeared

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:90%
after it was confronted.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:84%
They confronted the Soviet
Union at the time with it.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:84%
But in 2014, ham radio
operators in the United States

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
noticed they were hearing
the woodpecker signal again

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:90%
on a 14 millihertz band.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was all over the place,
that the woodpecker signal was

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
back and that the Russians were
passing electromagnetic waves

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:90%
over our country again.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and you talk
about the former Soviet

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Union and the psychotronic
weaponry that they used.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look first.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.590 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.500 align:middle line:10%
- Well, in the Soviet Union,
a Radio Frequency or RF device

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:10%
has been used for over
30 years to manipulate

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:10%
the moods of mental patients.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:10%
It's called a Lida machine.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:10%
It radiates pulses of
radio frequency energy

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:10%
as well as light,
sound, and heat.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:10%
The pulse rate is in the
extremely low frequency

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:10%
range between 0 and
100 pulses per second.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Ross Eady is
the top researcher

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:10%
at the Veterans
Administration Hospital

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:10%
in Loma Linda, California.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:10%
He has been investigating the
effects of the Lida machine.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.640 align:middle line:10%
- Now, what do the Soviets
use this machine for?

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.057 align:middle line:10%
- Well, they don't
use it anymore.

00:08:39.057 --> 00:08:40.704 align:middle line:10%
We should be very
clear that this

00:08:40.704 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:10%
is a machine which is
regarded by them as somewhat

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.570 align:middle line:10%
obsolete technologically.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:10%
- This scientist who did
not want his identity

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.040 align:middle line:10%
revealed is employed
by the US government

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.040 align:middle line:10%
and has done secret
RF weapons research.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:10%
He believes the tests
done with the Lida

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.210 align:middle line:10%
and similar machines
prove that humans

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:10%
are susceptible to remote
alterations of mood

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:10%
and awareness.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:10%
- Certain kinds of weak
electromagnetic signals

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:10%
look exactly like drugs.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:10%
So the premise is
that anything you

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:10%
can do with drugs you could do
with the right electromagnetic

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:10%
signals.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:10%
Apparently there are
specific sites involved,

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.040 align:middle line:10%
specific functions involved.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:10%
It's a matter of
matching up just

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:10%
like it is with a pill or
a drug to cause and effect.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:10%
You could have a
cause and effect

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:10%
relationship between
a magnetic field

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.112 align:middle line:10%
and a biological function.

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.390 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, frightening,
but at the same time

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.487 align:middle line:84%
fascinating that they
would be able to do this.

00:09:37.487 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: No, and I've always
said for years in this fight

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:84%
that this technology
has a place.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.648 align:middle line:84%
And I've never been one
that's calling for the ban

00:09:45.648 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:84%
on this technology,
because certainly there

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:84%
is some good that
can come from it.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, there's no
good coming from it right now.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly bad.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But as you saw on the clip,
the Soviet Union kind of

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:90%
started working on this first.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've actually worked
on it here in this country

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.180 align:middle line:84%
too, especially under the
Navy with microwave research

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.250 align:middle line:84%
where they were able
to take people, bombard

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
the temporal areas of the
brain with the right frequency

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:84%
of extremely low frequency
waves and create what they

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:90%
call a sentinel being effect.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
these people either

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
felt like they were
in the presence of God

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:84%
or the other thing is felt
like they were taken by aliens

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
aliens in the room.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.657 align:middle line:84%
Now that's
interesting, because we

00:10:26.657 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:84%
have millions of people in
this country that think they've

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.702 align:middle line:90%
been abducted by aliens.

00:10:30.702 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: And that's why we're
kind of on the fence with that

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:84%
is can some of that
be experimentation

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.080 align:middle line:84%
with electromagnetic
weapons on the brain?

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And certainly I think
maybe some of it is.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: John, you're a doctor.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.190 align:middle line:84%
You specialize in
stem cell therapy.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.530 align:middle line:84%
How in the world
did you get involved

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.090 align:middle line:90%
in electronic surveillance?

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: I actually was
engaged to a girl who

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:84%
came to me after a broken
engagement with some very

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:90%
weird complaints.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:90%
And she came to me.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.868 align:middle line:84%
She said, you're the
only person I trust.

00:10:58.868 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else is going to
send me to a psychiatrist.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I've got people that I
don't recognize stalking me.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:84%
They're with me following
me every time I go anywhere,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hearing
voices in my head that

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:84%
are describing where I'm at
and the type of attacks that

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
are being perpetrated on my
body with weapons I can't see.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.627 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you believe her?

00:11:19.627 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Well, I mean,
I knew this girl well.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she was not--

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.573 align:middle line:84%
had no psychiatric
illness history.

00:11:24.573 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's stable?

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.973 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: She had no drug history.

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So we spent the money and
we counter-surveilled her.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
We put counter-surveillance
equipment in her condo.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, she was being
stalked by a former FBI

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
agent working with a giant
private investigative

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.480 align:middle line:84%
She was being
followed everywhere

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
she goes and unfortunately was
being drugged with rohypnol

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:90%
and sexually assaulted.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Mostly part
of experimentation.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And the way it looks with
this type of technology,

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:84%
you do have to have some form
of clearance to access it.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:84%
This isn't something you
and I can Google and order

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:90%
this equipment online.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:84%
You have to be hooked up
to a system to use it.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.555 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the way
it works is the groups

00:12:07.555 --> 00:12:09.055 align:middle line:84%
in every major city
that are allowed

00:12:09.055 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:84%
to access it can use it carte
blanche on whoever they want

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.580 align:middle line:84%
to for whatever reason as
long as the data gets back

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:90%
to the appropriate agency.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And the group in Texas tends
to use it for sexual assault.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And she happened
to be singled out.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bizarre.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
When Edward Snowden blew
the lid off of the NSA

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things
they were doing,

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it is just the
tip of the iceberg.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Oh, he said it's
the tip of the iceberg.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:84%
He still has more
documents to release.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
The big favor that Edward
Snowden did to this community

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.060 align:middle line:84%
is everybody that's victimized
by this technology has been

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:84%
saying for years that their cell
phones are being listened to,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
their texts are being
read, their emails

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:90%
are being manipulated.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I myself have sat down,
looked at my email,

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and watched emails disappear
without me erasing them

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.105 align:middle line:84%
as well as most
victims have reported.

00:13:01.105 --> 00:13:02.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, nobody believed that.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
They called them the
tinfoil hat people.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.517 align:middle line:84%
And the government
just wouldn't do that

00:13:05.517 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:84%
to you is what most
people would say.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, when Snowden released his
documents, well lo and behold,

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:84%
yes, the government
can scan all your text,

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
they can scan all
your emails, and we

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:84%
do have supercomputers that
can handle that much data now.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of brought it
from conspiracy theory

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:90%
to conspiracy fact.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My late father,
John, was in World War II.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And if I were to talk to him
about this when he was alive,

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:84%
that the government was
doing this and that,

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:84%
a World War II veteran
wouldn't believe it.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't believe it.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because at that time,
even though our government was

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:84%
experimenting on people,
they were putting biologicals

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:90%
over sailors and ships.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
They tested people in St.
Louis with biologicals.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:90%
But he wouldn't believe it.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you
would ever question

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.210 align:middle line:84%
the authenticity of
what this nation was

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:90%
doing it to protect citizens.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.980 align:middle line:90%
He was a military guy.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And he would say,
George, you're nuts.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:90%
You're crazy.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Today he'd probably hear
this, listening to my show

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.790 align:middle line:84%
as he often did, going, what
in the world is going on?

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:90%
What made this change?

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:27.530 align:middle line:84%
What happened from
a nation that was

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.450 align:middle line:90%
for the people, what happened?

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Where did it change?

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.170 align:middle line:10%
>>HALL: Well, that's
an interesting story,

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.003 align:middle line:10%
because I had the same
thing with my father.

00:14:35.003 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:90%
We're similar in age.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.540 align:middle line:84%
My father who's now passed on
as well, when he first read

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:84%
some of my books and
heard some of my radio

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:84%
shows, he was like, well, the
government wouldn't do this

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:90%
to its own people.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't do it.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.088 align:middle line:84%
Well, he wasn't into the
computer age right off.

00:14:50.088 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was later in life,
right before his death,

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:84%
that they got their
first computer.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, I came to
his house one day

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and he had a quarter duct
taped over the camera

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.510 align:middle line:90%
on the computer.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.042 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's with the
quarter on your computer?

00:15:02.042 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you know
they've got programs now.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:84%
The government can watch
you through the camera.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.823 align:middle line:84%
And I said, dad, I've been
saying that for 10 years.

00:15:08.823 --> 00:15:10.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He finally understood.

00:15:10.115 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: He finally understood.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It took him that
long to understand.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And you're right, that
generation is hard to convince,

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.948 align:middle line:84%
because they don't believe
the government would

00:15:16.948 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:90%
attack its own citizens.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I think what we've
come down to a point

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
now where the government,
whether on either side

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:84%
of the political
spectrum, whether it's

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Democrat or Republican, I
think they all want control.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:84%
They want larger
government and they

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:84%
want a way to control the
initiatives of the public.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.652 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they want to know.

00:15:33.652 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
They want to know who
is being subversive,

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
who is being
anti-government, and they

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
want to know where those
people are at any given time.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: And the bad thing
is that you never know--

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.990 align:middle line:84%
that is a situation that changes
depending on who's in office.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.450 align:middle line:84%
What makes you a
radical one day may

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:90%
make you a patriot the next.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:90%
In our eyes.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.817 align:middle line:90%
You talked about the emails.

00:15:55.817 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:90%
We've got a few.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Justin from Apple Valley,
California writes, "My family

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.700 align:middle line:84%
doesn't believe
I'm being targeted.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.513 align:middle line:90%
How can I convince them?"

00:16:04.513 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: My recommendation,
I come across this a lot,

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.417 align:middle line:84%
is don't browbeat
them to believe you,

00:16:08.417 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:84%
because that makes you look more
mentally ill than if you just

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.740 align:middle line:90%
let it go.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.232 align:middle line:84%
Certainly have them read
"Guinea Pigs" or any other books

00:16:16.232 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that are written
by some of us that

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:84%
have kind of chosen that
pathway to deal with the public.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:84%
"Guinea Pigs," if
anybody reads this,

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:84%
this is all backed
up by factual stuff.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not written based
on Google searches.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:84%
It's written to some extent
based on classified documents.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Certainly try to vent
your frustrations

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.135 align:middle line:84%
in with some of the
groups that we have

00:16:38.135 --> 00:16:39.260 align:middle line:90%
that are dealing with this.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Don't vent to family
members that don't believe,

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
because it'll be your
family members or the people

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:43.580 align:middle line:90%
you work for.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Difficult for the
family members to believe.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Difficult for the
family members to believe.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But if they look at
it when they read

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
"Guinea Pigs," because I've
seen so many people with this

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
that I can put it in the
context that it's not just

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:90%
that family's loved one.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It's 300,000 other
people's loved ones.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.847 align:middle line:84%
Then it puts it in
a better context.

00:17:01.847 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of 10 people
who claim that they're

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.475 align:middle line:84%
being electronically
stalked, what percent

00:17:07.475 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
would you say are
telling the truth?

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.188 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: It's hard to say.

00:17:13.188 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
problems we have with it is

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.786 align:middle line:84%
this technology was designed
to look like mental illness.

00:17:18.786 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:84%
Specifically designed to
look like mental illness,

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
because when it initially
started with MKUltra,

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.720 align:middle line:84%
the people that headed this
up were psychiatrists heading

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.520 align:middle line:90%
departments for MKUltra.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:90%
So there's no mistake on that.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.990 align:middle line:84%
The big distractor
with it is for one,

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.090 align:middle line:84%
schizophrenics
don't seek out help.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:90%
They avoid it at all costs.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.182 align:middle line:84%
These people are risking getting
a mental diagnosis to get help

00:17:41.182 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:90%
for a criminal problem.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That goes
on their record.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: And that
goes on their record.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Also true schizophrenia
will respond to medications.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:84%
People that are
being targeted, even

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.050 align:middle line:84%
once they're on medications,
they're still targeted.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if somebody
comes up to you and says,

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:57.950 align:middle line:90%
this is happening to me.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm being targeted.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I know my neighbor's
listening to me.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:90%
He's with the government.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you generally
accept that quickly

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.710 align:middle line:84%
or do you look at them
with a grain of salt?

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: No, we have
to listen to the story

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and kind of decide what
they're being convinced is true

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.180 align:middle line:90%
and what really is true.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.638 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that they are

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.170 align:middle line:84%
great at doing with
this technology

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:84%
is convincing you that it's your
family members doing it to you

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:84%
or convincing you that it's
your neighbors doing it to you.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want
you to think that.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: They want
you to think that.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:84%
The quickest route to a mental
home or a mental evaluation

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
is to go accusing your neighbors
or accusing your family.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:32.912 align:middle line:90%
And they realize that.

00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everyone's
looking at you.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.102 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: So it's done very
specifically that way.

00:18:37.102 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have to sit down
with these people,

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle line:84%
explain to them the way
the technology works,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't have to be
somebody next door doing it

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.790 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not somebody
with a microwave

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.180 align:middle line:84%
oven with a funnel in it
doing it from the other wall.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's hard to convince
when you have people

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:90%
living in apartment settings.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:84%
When we've done our research,
we've done it in Texas.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:84%
We've taken these
people out onto ranches

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:84%
that are 6,000 acres that have
no power lines and no cell

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:90%
service.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:84%
We've taken them out in
boats in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:90%
No power lines, no cell service.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's not somebody with
a handheld weapon doing it

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:90%
anywhere near.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:84%
There's not somebody doing
it from a power line,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and there's not somebody
doing it from a cell tower.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
being attacked.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:84%
So that means it is coming
from HARP or satellite based

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.633 align:middle line:90%
or a combination of the both.

00:19:20.633 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
of these people,

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:84%
John, who are being
stalked may be

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:84%
known to the individuals in
government that are doing this?

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.503 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Probably all of them.

00:19:33.503 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:84%
who is with the government
who says, let's do this guy.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:90%
I know him.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:40.220 align:middle line:90%
He's a little weird.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's do him.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.478 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: No, what
they often will do

00:19:42.478 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
is the perpetrators
will come and they

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
will try to get some of
your neighbors to join in.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.345 align:middle line:84%
And that's one thing I'm
very clear with people.

00:19:51.345 --> 00:19:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I said, when you first move into
a neighborhood or an apartment

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.772 align:middle line:90%
complex, meet your neighbors.

00:19:55.772 --> 00:19:56.730 align:middle line:90%
Go meet your neighbors.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Introduce yourself.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Don't necessarily
tell them about this.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:84%
But at least let them
know you so that way

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.430 align:middle line:84%
when people come pretending
to be the FBI, usually

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:84%
private investigators
pretending to be the FBI,

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and say, we need your
help watching this person,

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:84%
they'll call you and tell you
it happened or call the police

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and say, I've got people here
pretending to be the FBI.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another
email in from Janice

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:90%
in West Hartford, Connecticut.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:84%
"I'm getting voice
to skull targeting.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:90%
How do I make the voices stop?"

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.035 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is an
interesting question.

00:20:30.035 --> 00:20:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: That's the most
disconcerting part of this.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it in
her head or not?

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Well, and
typically if you

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.880 align:middle line:84%
look at descriptions from
schizophrenics on what they

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.690 align:middle line:84%
hear with auditory delusions,
it's usually voices of God,

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.880 align:middle line:84%
voices of angels,
people telling you

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:84%
you've been anointed or
garbled voices like you

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:90%
would hear on a subway.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.860 align:middle line:84%
What these people
hear is descriptions

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.690 align:middle line:84%
of their whereabouts,
descriptions

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.060 align:middle line:84%
of what they're wearing,
descriptions of what they look

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.380 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:84%
It's made to be very
apparent to the victim

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.605 align:middle line:84%
that someone is watching and
knows what they're doing.

00:21:04.605 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next step is
they feel like there's

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.502 align:middle line:90%
cameras in the house.

00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:90%
They know where I'm at.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.150 align:middle line:90%
They know what I'm wearing.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:84%
There must be
cameras in the house.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's not.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:15.182 align:middle line:84%
It's all done by manipulation
of the EEG in the brain.

00:21:15.182 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:84%
They'll dig through their homes
and dig through their sheet

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:84%
rock to look for cameras, but
there's usually none found.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:84%
The best way to
avoid that is we've

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
found that there's a certain
waveform within the EEG

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
that has to be there for
this technology to take.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
If you can re-synchronize
both hemispheres of the brain

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.300 align:middle line:84%
with a similar pattern for
the EEG, then most of this

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:90%
will go away.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And what we've been using
are binaural beat programs

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:84%
We'll have the victims
put earphones in,

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.840 align:middle line:84%
pick an ambient sound, pick
a binaural beat program,

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and re-synchronize both
hemispheres of the brain

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:90%
to 7.8 hertz.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
works that way?

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: And that works.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.090 align:middle line:84%
John, Carla from
California claims

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
that she is under
electronic surveillance,

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:90%
that she is being stalked.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.260 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to
her via Skype right now.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.325 align:middle line:84%
Carla, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLA: Good
morning, gentlemen.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.337 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:22:11.337 --> 00:22:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's my pleasure.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:84%
We're with Dr.
John Hall as well.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Carla, tell us a little bit
about what has happened to you

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and how long this
has been going on.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLA: I've been a
victim of covert harassment

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:90%
and stalking since 1992.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
However, it did not become
visible to me until about '94.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I was in a bad relationship
and it ended bad.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And he actually told me that
he put me in this program,

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:48.510 align:middle line:84%
but I just shunned it because
it didn't even make sense to me.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
good luck getting out.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
maintain a job for a while

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:90%
and raise my children.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And about a year and a
half ago, my daughter

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:09.240 align:middle line:84%
was actually murdered and they
have not found the suspect,

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and there have been
no arrests made.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:84%
She was murdered
in North Carolina.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that
people were stalking me

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:90%
and they were also--

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:84%
they had also begun harassing
my 21-year-old son as well.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, my son came to me and
said that he had voices,

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:34.810 align:middle line:84%
he heard voices, which I
know the terminology is

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.150 align:middle line:90%
the remote neuromonitoring.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I also have been suffering
that as well since 1994.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.270 align:middle line:90%
I do know the difference.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I do know that I
am completely sane.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:90%
And so I never questioned that.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But then I began to see
that around 2000, people

00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:84%
were acting strange, using hand
signals when they would talk.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And I began to experience
pain in my body that

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.600 align:middle line:90%
did not make sense.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And I went all these years
just thinking that it was me.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:84%
However, when my
daughter was murdered,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I actually Googled my
symptoms and became aware

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:23.640 align:middle line:84%
of the terminology and
began to read about it

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and actually found
supportive groups on Facebook

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:90%
and in social outlets.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So it really validated
what I was going through

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and it gave me some clarity,
because I'm the type of person

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:84%
that there has to be a
logical explanation for what

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:90%
is going on.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So the more I dug
into it, the more I

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:55.090 align:middle line:84%
became aware of different
things and what it meant.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I was relieved
to know and I'm

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:84%
sorry for everybody
that's going through this,

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:84%
but I was relieved to know
that it was just not me.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And so from there, I
have made police reports.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:90%
I contacted the FBI.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.940 align:middle line:90%
I began reaching out to people.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, I
met Dr. John Hall.

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And he's willing
to help me as well.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very grateful
for the people

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.300 align:middle line:90%
that have come across my path.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, as you
look at her situation,

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:90%
it's not uncommon, is it?

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: No.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Her situation pretty much
as a situation of most TIs.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I've even had, like she said,
she knew she wasn't crazy.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:84%
She knew she was
being victimized.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I've even had some TIs contact
me asking me, well, am I crazy?

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing voices, and
typically that's schizophrenia.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:90%
Do you think I have it?

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, true schizophrenics
never do that.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't come to their
doctors and say, well, I'm

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:03.960 align:middle line:90%
hearing voices.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:90%
I must be crazy.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.410 align:middle line:84%
These people, like
I said, they're

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:84%
risking accepting
or risking getting

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.170 align:middle line:84%
a mental illness in
their quest for help

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.040 align:middle line:90%
with a criminal activity.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So kudos to them, because
once you get that diagnosis,

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:84%
it can ruin your life even more
than the electronic harassment.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, she's pretty
common for a victim,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.310 align:middle line:90%
and most victims are female.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a predilection for
female victims, especially

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:84%
those that are divorced,
single, or living alone.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Carla, first of
all, accept our condolences

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:84%
on the tragic death
of your daughter.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLA: Thank you.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.403 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:26:43.403 --> 00:26:44.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you
think that somehow

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.840 align:middle line:10%
was tied into this
electronic surveillance?

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLA: I know it was.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.920 align:middle line:84%
My daughter was
expressing major fear.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to my
daughter actually the night

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:90%
before she was found dead.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And she was
expressing major fear

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.500 align:middle line:84%
that she was being
followed and she

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.090 align:middle line:90%
thought she had been poisoned.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.040 align:middle line:90%
She didn't feel good.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had told her
go to the doctor.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And she was expressing that
she was hearing voices as well

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.130 align:middle line:90%
and people were following her.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:90%
So it was a major concern.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.660 align:middle line:90%
I have not--

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I definitely would
begin to see danger

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:84%
of what he was expressing to
me, I got a restraining order

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:90%
and I have not seen him since.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that
wherever you go,

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.150 align:middle line:90%
they pass the contract around.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So back in the day, you used
to be able to get in your car

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and drive away from this,
go to another state,

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and it would take them
years to find you.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But thanks to the
social outlet, the media

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.880 align:middle line:84%
with Facebook and things like
that, they can actually--

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and the GPS on your phone
and the tracking devices

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:90%
that they have.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he
part of government?

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLA: Actually no.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.550 align:middle line:90%
He had mob ties.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:13.270 align:middle line:84%
He was a hardened criminal,
and I did not know it.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I was 22 when I met
him and very naive.

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I do fit the criteria
for what they're

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:23.990 align:middle line:90%
looking for in this program.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:90%
I was raised in a foster home.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.280 align:middle line:90%
I have a broken family.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:90%
I am widowed.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a very hard
time in my life.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:36.030 align:middle line:90%
My husband died of colon cancer.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I was very
vulnerable and very naive

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and was not paying attention to
things that I should have been.

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:48.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How long did you date
this guy before he started

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:52.390 align:middle line:10%
doing these things to you?

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLA: Probably three
years, four years.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How unusual is it
for an ex-boyfriend or husband

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:03.508 align:middle line:84%
to, as she said,
be in the program?

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Oh, it's
not uncommon at all.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.940 align:middle line:90%
This can be hired done.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.370 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, the
groups that have access

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.200 align:middle line:84%
to this technology,
most of them are

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:84%
private investigative groups
run by former FBI and former CIA

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:15.970 align:middle line:90%
agents.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:19.810 align:middle line:84%
We proved that in Texas because
we counter-surveilled a group

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.570 align:middle line:90%
that does this in Texas.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So basically, one
way to look at it

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:84%
is they are subcontracting
the research

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.985 align:middle line:84%
for the legitimate agencies
within the government.

00:29:28.985 --> 00:29:31.360 align:middle line:84%
They started doing that after
the Rockefeller Commission,

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.410 align:middle line:84%
because the CIA got
their hand slapped.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So now you basically
have a group

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.580 align:middle line:84%
of subcontractors that can carte
blanche experiment on whoever

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:40.480 align:middle line:90%
they want to.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Or if somebody comes to
you with money and says,

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:84%
I want to hire you to drive this
person crazy, they'll do it.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.640 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
finance themselves.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.520 align:middle line:84%
As long as the data goes back
to the appropriate agency

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.050 align:middle line:90%
on how well it works.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Carla, let me ask you
this as we wrap up with you.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:84%
This has obviously
destroyed your life.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.330 align:middle line:90%
How are you coping?

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLA: I've learned
to just balance myself.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I encourage any
targeted individual

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.870 align:middle line:84%
that is out there to stay
proactive in being social.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.320 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody is bad.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody is against you.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And to stay proactive
in being social.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Don't give up your
church activities.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Don't give up your social
life because people

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.960 align:middle line:90%
are trying to harm you.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.410 align:middle line:84%
That is the intent of what
they are trying to accomplish

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:90%
is keeping you isolated.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And the more isolated you
become, the more of a danger

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.990 align:middle line:90%
you are in, actually.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So I've been very proactive
in speaking out against it.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I have been proactive in
just being very social

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and just being outside and
doing functioning activities,

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.420 align:middle line:90%
staying busy as I can.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I really am trying to move
forward with getting this scan.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.310 align:middle line:90%
It gives me hope.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.260 align:middle line:90%
That really does.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.560 align:middle line:84%
As I can collect the
information and present it

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.510 align:middle line:84%
in a proper order,
that gives me the hope

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.293 align:middle line:90%
that this will come to an end.

00:31:24.293 --> 00:31:26.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You stay strong,
Carla, and thank you

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:31.487 align:middle line:10%
for giving us some of the time
to talk with you about this.

00:31:31.487 --> 00:31:33.404 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLA: Thank you very
much for having me on.

00:31:33.404 --> 00:31:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And you guys have a great day.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, I
feel for Carla and I

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:84%
feel for the
hundreds of thousands

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.410 align:middle line:84%
of people who
apparently are going

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
through the same
situation as she is.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But she seems strong in
spite of all the things

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.000 align:middle line:90%
that have happened to her.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.670 align:middle line:84%
The death of her daughter,
the surveillance.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:84%
She seems like
she understands it

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and she knows how to
battle it and fight it.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:84%
What recommendations
do you give to people

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.440 align:middle line:84%
who think they're being
electronically stalked

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.240 align:middle line:90%
like Carla?

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Well, she
made a good point,

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's the same
point I make in my book.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Don't be a recluse.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.880 align:middle line:90%
Continue to try to go to work.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Continue to try and
go and socialize.

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Go to church.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Go to whatever
you ordinarily do.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.208 align:middle line:90%
Go be with your friends.

00:32:21.208 --> 00:32:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't shut down.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.143 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Don't shut down,
because that's what

00:32:24.143 --> 00:32:25.310 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to do to you.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.050 align:middle line:84%
They want you to
stop all of that

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately
the goal is to get you

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.340 align:middle line:84%
in front of a psychiatrist
and get you a diagnosis.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Because once they
do that, they know

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:84%
you'll have no option pretty
much except to sit at home

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:36.980 align:middle line:90%
and be a guinea pig.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So what you need to do
is continue socializing.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly the
recommendation that she's made

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and how she's dealt
with this successfully.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same recommendation
I make in "Guinea Pigs."

>>NOORY: Do they, and those who
are testing you and surveilling

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.580 align:middle line:84%
on you, do they stop
eventually and just

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.320 align:middle line:90%
move on to the next victim?

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Actually, from
our counter-surveillance

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:84%
of the group in
Texas that does this,

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.550 align:middle line:90%
it's a matter of manpower.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.227 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of
manpower to do this.

00:33:07.227 --> 00:33:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And once they see that you're
going to continue working,

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.430 align:middle line:84%
you're going to continue social,
continue living, a lot of times

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:15.920 align:middle line:84%
they will move on
just to dedicate

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.700 align:middle line:84%
that manpower to surveil
somebody on another victim.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you live
your life, I mean,

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that probably is your
best defense against it.
