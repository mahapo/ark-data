>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:10%
For years, we have talked
about the phenomenon of UFOs.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.070 align:middle line:10%
Extraterrestrials.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:10%
And tonight, we've
got a great one.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ANNOUNCER: A UFO report by
an American Airlines pilot

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:84%
recently became international
news thanks to a UFO enthusiast

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:84%
with a ham radio, a
Freedom of Information Act

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:84%
request, and a devoted group
of people who spread the word.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:10%
Among those people
was Erica Lukes,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:10%
the host of "UFO Classified"
and the former Utah State

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:10%
director for the Mutual UFO
Network, also known as MUFON.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:10%
After catching interest
at just six years of age,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:10%
she has spent her life
delving much further

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:10%
into UFOs, abductions,
and the paranormal.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
Erica shares stories of
her firsthand experiences

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
with UFOs and the orange orbs
captivating Utah residents,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:90%
today, on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Quite a
background, Erica.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ERICA LUKES: You know, I do.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:10%
But it's so fabulous.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.140 align:middle line:10%
I've had such a diverse
life, and I've always

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:10%
had an interest in this subject.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.037 align:middle line:10%
And it's just the more I
learn, the more I want to know.

00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about the little girl

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
episodes, which really became
your catapult for all of this.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I was six
years old, and I

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:84%
remember being in the school
library, of all places.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a book with
a UFO on the cover.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And I picked it up,
and from that second,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:90%
I was just-- I was mesmerized.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:90%
I was hooked.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know what
it was all about.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.125 align:middle line:84%
And so I began reading
everything I could get.

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:84%
You get the "Communion,"
Whitley Strieber

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
stuff in high school
and different things.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I just-- and
Budd Hopkins, as well.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I miss him.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: I know.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I am so sorry that I didn't
get the chance to meet him.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:90%
But it was fascinating.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had, as an early adult,
some paranormal experiences.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:84%
Some pretty profound
paranormal experiences

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
that everyone around
me, they were all

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:90%
witnessing this as well.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And so Always the
interest there.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a UFO sighting,
an orange orb sighting,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.787 align:middle line:90%
in 2013.

00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, not too long ago.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: No, not too long ago.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But it was such a
trip, because we've

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
got this beautiful view of the
valley, of Salt Lake Valley.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And my friends and I were
hanging out on my porch one

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:84%
summer night and
looking, and you

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:84%
can see the aircraft coming
in and all of this stuff.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But we noticed this big,
bright, orange ball.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.202 align:middle line:84%
And we looked at
it and thought, OK.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:90%
Let's give it a second.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's a plane.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.912 align:middle line:90%
What could this be?

00:02:52.912 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we got
the binoculars out.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:90%
We were watching it.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And there were no
navigation lights

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.550 align:middle line:84%
like you would
expect on a plane.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And then another one appeared
to drop out of the large object,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and then it moved around in a
circle around the big object.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:84%
We were all just sitting
there like, that was very odd.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big was it?

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.536 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: You know,
it was probably

00:03:14.536 --> 00:03:17.220 align:middle line:84%
the size of my thumbnail if
I were to hold my hand out.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.971 align:middle line:90%
So it was larger--

00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: About the
size of the moon.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yeah.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:84%
It was very-- it was such
one of those experiences.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And you always try to
rationalize things.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But I knew with the behavior
of these two objects,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:84%
this was nothing
I could explain,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and so that made me want
to really delve into this.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Because if I was
seeing that, that

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:84%
means other people in Salt
Lake were seeing that.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And as I did my
investigations, I

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
contacted anybody
I could think of.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.317 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I even called
Dugway Proving Ground.

00:03:49.317 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they listen to you?

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Of course not.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.584 align:middle line:84%
But it was worth a try.
[LAUGHS] You know, I just--

00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This whack job's
on the phone, right?

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Ah, you know.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:90%
But it was-- I wanted to know.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to
approach it and talk

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:90%
to every person I could.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I talked
to the observatory

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:90%
in Utah and scientists, pilots.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that
there was a definite need

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.105 align:middle line:84%
for a strong
organization in Utah

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:84%
because I knew we
had Skin Walker

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Ranch and places like this.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a great place
for sightings.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.213 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Oh my gosh.

00:04:22.213 --> 00:04:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Utah is just-- it's bri-- it
truly is a hotbed of activity.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:84%
But I became an
investigator for MUFON,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and then I became
the state director.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And we have so many
great cases there.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And now we just need
to expand awareness.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
We need to let people
know that we're there,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and they can report to us, and
we can do some great things.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Erica, what has
happened to the field of UFOs?

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember
back when I was a kid,

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
these cases were
absolutely staggering.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had Lonnie Zamora,
the New Mexico police officer,

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:84%
witnessing an object with
several occupants walking

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.480 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
We had indentations in the
ground of landing spots.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:84%
We had burned areas where
the craft had come down.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
We had all these
incredible encounters

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
that we don't hear
today anymore.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.806 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I think it's a
combination of things,

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and that's a great question
that we often talk about.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I think that perhaps the
phenomenon is changing,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and now we're getting a
lot of the orb sightings.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that people don't
know where to report things.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes
they report things

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:90%
to larger organizations, and--

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've got
Peter Davenport's National UFO

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Reporting Center.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Right.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.870 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And a majority of his
sightings are orange orbs.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Lately.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Fireballs.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lately.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:90%
He's been getting lots of them.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.710 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
drive him crazy. [LAUGHS]

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I talk to him
frequently about that

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.437 align:middle line:84%
because he knows that
I'm an advocate for that,

00:05:56.437 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and we're both trying to get the
word out, which is important.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we don't
have a lot of transparency,

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that we are
getting those good cases,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:84%
but for whatever
reason, organizations

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:84%
aren't choosing,
perhaps, to share

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.010 align:middle line:90%
those cases with the public.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
We just aren't
getting those cases

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.130 align:middle line:84%
anymore that-- even the
far-fetched ones from way

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:90%
gone back.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
George Adamski talking
about being taken to Venus.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, that-- whether you
believe that or not.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.870 align:middle line:84%
But we don't even
get those anymore.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I think maybe too
there's a ridicule factor.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can't--

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.343 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, there always was.

00:06:36.343 --> 00:06:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Right, but--

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I mean,
the really hardened

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:84%
cases, the incredible
cases, even

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.050 align:middle line:84%
the mutilation stories we
don't hear a lot about anymore.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, the cattle mutilations
and things like that.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Right.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:90%
And they're still happening.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.170 align:middle line:84%
We're still getting reports
in Utah all the time.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're getting
crop formations.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Right.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:90%
With lots of crop circles.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have my own
theories about that.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But it just seems like
something has gone back.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.640 align:middle line:84%
But orbs, I always
thought orbs might

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.720 align:middle line:90%
be spirits floating around.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.500 align:middle line:90%
You don't think so.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I think
that we don't know.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is a
connection between what

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:84%
you would classify a
paranormal orb or the orb

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:84%
that you would see
in your bedroom.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I think that you get those
types of orbs, maybe a little

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:84%
bit larger, the size
of a basketball,

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.290 align:middle line:84%
that people will witness outside
their homes, above power lines.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the
objects in the sky,

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.730 align:middle line:90%
the sphere objects, UFOs.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they're different.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.380 align:middle line:84%
We need funding, and we
need to research this.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
difficult to find.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.546 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: It is really
difficult to find.

00:07:41.546 --> 00:07:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think in America, we have
such a stigma against this.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's for lots
of different reasons.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I think we've let the fringe
element overtake a lot of what

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
UFOlogy, quote
unquote, "UFOlogy" is,

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think that's
necessarily done us any favors.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We need
a great sighting.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:04.760 align:middle line:84%
We need a great national
sighting of something landing

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:84%
to get people excited
again about this.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Right?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.745 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have-- I mean, look at
the Phoenix Lights case in '97.

00:08:12.745 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:84%
That was such a great
case, and yet still you

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:90%
have people arguing about it.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:90%
That they were flares.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.940 align:middle line:90%
That they were Chinese lanterns.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.840 align:middle line:90%
That they were military jets.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: I know.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.763 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You get all these
people seeing an object which

00:08:27.763 --> 00:08:30.457 align:middle line:90%
was about a mile long.

00:08:30.457 --> 00:08:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: It's interesting.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know because you deal
with so many people's belief

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And we have to try to
separate this from a belief

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:90%
to a factual thing.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.770 align:middle line:90%
Here is the data.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:84%
You cannot look at all of the
government documents that have

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:90%
been obtained.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
You can't look at all of the
scientific evidence in places

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:90%
like Hessdalen, over in Norway.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:90%
30 years of data over there.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:84%
They've identified
four different types

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
of light phenomena that
responds intelligently.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.100 align:middle line:90%
So you can't argue about that.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And we need to get
some good people out

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
there in front that are
professional, that can lead

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.946 align:middle line:90%
the way and say, look at this.

00:09:15.946 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a
belief, it's a fact.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Erica, there
was a case that you folks

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.460 align:middle line:84%
in the field of UFOlogy call
the American Airlines Case.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.880 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.282 align:middle line:90%
>>PLANE CREW: American 434.

00:09:29.282 --> 00:09:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>APPROACH TOWER:
American 434, go ahead.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.654 align:middle line:84%
>>PLANE CREW: You
wouldn't happen

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:34.227 align:middle line:84%
to know what these bright,
orange-ish squares are, flying

00:09:34.227 --> 00:09:36.468 align:middle line:90%
over, would you?

00:09:36.468 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>APPROACH TOWER: Um, no,
that's a good question.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what they-- is
it off to your right side?

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PLANE CREW: It's directly
off our nose right now.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.095 align:middle line:90%
It's right below us.

00:09:45.095 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But we've been watching
it for a while.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- I don't
know what it is.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfect square,
and it's bright orange.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] off
our 2 o'clock low.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.095 align:middle line:84%
>>APPROACH TOWER: American 434,
that is Nephi, Nephi, Utah.

00:09:59.095 --> 00:09:59.928 align:middle line:90%
>>PLANE CREW: Nephi.

00:09:59.928 --> 00:10:00.884 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:10:00.884 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll see what I go find.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>APPROACH TOWER: You bet.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, that's an FAA
actual recording, Erica.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.436 align:middle line:84%
But tell us more
about the episode.

00:10:10.436 --> 00:10:11.360 align:middle line:90%
About the case.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: This-- oh my
gosh, this is, I think,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
one of the best cases that
we've seen in a long, long time.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And it made international
news, it was so important.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So I have an
acquaintance in Utah.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:84%
His name is Pat Daniels, and
he's host of "Fringe Radio."

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.570 align:middle line:84%
He contacted me because
he had overheard-- he was

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:90%
scanning different frequencies.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
He's a very experienced
ham operator,

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and he was scanning VHF
channels or frequencies.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And he overheard two
different transmissions

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:45.290 align:middle line:84%
that were incredibly odd to him,
between an American Airlines

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:84%
crew and the Salt Lake
City approach tower.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting
enough to him

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.280 align:middle line:84%
that he could tell that there
was alarm in the pilot's voice.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
The pilot, according to Daniels,
came over the air and said,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:84%
there's an object
that's a mile wide.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be
pacing the plane.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Do you have it on radar?

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:90%
So you've got that.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And he told me
this, and he said,

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.910 align:middle line:84%
this is the frequency that
I was hearing this on.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:19.041 align:middle line:84%
You can go to the ATC website
and download the audios.

00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's there.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: So I did that,
and I thought, oh my gosh.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:90%
This is a cool case.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So I called in my team, my then
assistant state director, Jeff

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Cox, and I called Bill
Puckett, with UFOs Northwest,

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:90%
who's brilliant.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.990 align:middle line:90%
He's helped me on cases before.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So I get them involved,
and we determine

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that the flight
that was in question

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:84%
here was an American Airlines
Flight 434, headed from San

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.922 align:middle line:90%
Francisco to Philadelphia.

00:11:48.922 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one we
heard the audio on.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Exactly.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So we did a FOIA request
for radar information,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.410 align:middle line:84%
radar data, the audio
information in the tower logs.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
a miracle happened.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Because we know how
getting stuff from the FAA

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:90%
can be a bit tricky sometimes.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But we received portions of
the audio tape which you just

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:84%
heard, and then we
received radar data

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:84%
that was mind blowing,
in my opinion.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was found
on the tower logs.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:84%
We didn't think there
would be anyway.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But with these two key
pieces of evidence,

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:90%
this was a great case.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:90%
It is a great case.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.291 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's look
at some of the returns,

00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
because this object apparently
came back again and again.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:90%
How many times?

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.236 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: You know, it was there
for the whole half an hour

00:12:38.236 --> 00:12:39.290 align:middle line:90%
that we have radar.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Oh, it was incredible.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- we were
really, truly hoping

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
that people we come forward
with this information,

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.970 align:middle line:84%
because it was over an
interstate in a really

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
remote part of-- right
outside of Nephi, Utah.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:84%
But so far, nobody
has come forward.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But surely
you had some witnesses.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm calling
you Shirley, Erica.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Well, you know.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always
wanted to say that.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Shirley, Erica.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to
look at some video

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and have you explain to
us what we're seeing.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at our next one.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.561 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:13:09.561 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:10%
So what are we looking at here?

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:10%
>>LUKES: So this is looking
northwest towards I-15,

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.930 align:middle line:10%
and you can see how absolutely
remote this area is.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:10%
There's some train tracks.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There's
nothing out there.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:10%
>>LUKES: No.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:10%
Nothing.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And this object
was hovering in that area?

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:10%
>>LUKES: Yes.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:10%
It was hovering in that area.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:10%
And the radar returns
are suggesting

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:10%
that this object or
objects, whatever

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:10%
we're getting the returns
from, span a nine mile area.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And the plane, the
American Airlines plane,

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.300 align:middle line:10%
witnessed that
light, that object,

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:10%
whatever it might have
been, around this region?

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.359 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yes.

00:13:49.359 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
another video, here.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:10%
This is the same area, right?

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.596 align:middle line:10%
>>LUKES: Yes, it
is the same area.

00:13:59.596 --> 00:14:00.470 align:middle line:10%
But you can just see.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there would be no--
with regard to the radar data,

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.300 align:middle line:10%
there would be nothing
there that would

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:10%
be causing anything other
than very unique returns,

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:11.511 align:middle line:10%
anomalous returns.

00:14:11.511 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got some
animation now of the radar

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.760 align:middle line:90%
of some of the returns.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm exci-- so what are those
little dots popping up?

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Those are returns.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those are the returns?

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yes.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it showed up on
radar as something solid.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: It did.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:90%
You know, they were solid.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.159 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they were.

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:90%
The really unique thing--

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would have to be
solid to get a radar return.

00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:90%
A blip back.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.403 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Oh my gosh.

00:14:35.403 --> 00:14:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And the really interesting
thing is the towers

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.690 align:middle line:84%
where we were getting the
radar data are spread out 90

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.752 align:middle line:90%
miles to 115 miles apart.

00:14:43.752 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
these aren't birds.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.212 align:middle line:90%
We know they're not drones.

00:14:47.212 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Over what time
period is this occurring now?

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: So this is from
about 12:10ish to-- we did it

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:90%
for a half an hour.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:90%
So we've got a half an hour.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.315 align:middle line:84%
And this was happening
the whole time.

00:14:58.315 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One object, though.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:90%
One object?

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: All of
these little objects.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:90%
106.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.732 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 106 objects, or
just one object 106 times?

00:15:04.732 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: You know what?

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:84%
We are-- we could only
speculate with regard to this.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that maybe
it was one large object,

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:90%
but we just don't know.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it just kept
bouncing around all over the--

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yeah.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it go-- kind
of blink on and blink off?

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yes.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.897 align:middle line:84%
And in areas that were
a couple miles apart.

00:15:22.897 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And picked up by radar.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yes.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when
it disappeared,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:90%
what happened to it?

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.118 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: We don't know.

00:15:29.118 --> 00:15:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Because when we did the
radar, the FOIA request,

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:84%
we only requested
a half an hour.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.857 align:middle line:84%
And in hindsight, we
will never do that again.

00:15:36.857 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: Because we
need-- we definitely

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.560 align:middle line:90%
should have gotten much more.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And we tried to go
back in after the fact,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.300 align:middle line:84%
but we all know that
the FAA dumps data

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.800 align:middle line:84%
after a certain period of time,
so we couldn't find anything

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.440 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And the other lesson that
we learned in this case

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
is that we would, instead
of just requesting audio

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:84%
for that specific
flight, we would

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:84%
have tried to pull audio in
from all the different flights

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:84%
in the area, because surely
somebody else would have seen.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Erica, what is your
experience as a MUFON director,

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:84%
as an investigator, what
does your experience tell you

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:84%
what we might have
been looking at there?

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: My experience says that
there was a very large object

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.544 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's no--

00:16:20.544 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't
know the origin.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: No we don't.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't-- for me, the
more I learn about this,

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:90%
the more questions I have.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know necessarily if
we're dealing with an ET thing,

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:84%
or if it's something that
is inter-dimensional,

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:90%
if it's something--

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or it's
ours, or Russian, or--

00:16:36.645 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yes.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows what?

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: Yeah, I think, with
regard to it being ours,

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
we have tens of
thousands of acres

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.484 align:middle line:84%
in Utah that is used for
top secret military testing.

00:16:48.484 --> 00:16:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
missile base out that way?

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.025 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: So there
isn't a missile base,

00:16:52.025 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:84%
but we've got Dugway Proving
Ground, which is chemical

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and biological weapons testing.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:90%
A pretty famous place, there.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have the
Utah Test and Training Range,

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:90%
and then we have the NSA.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what do
you think is happening?

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.369 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I think whatever
is happening very well

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:84%
could be keeping track of
what's going on in our state.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.510 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I think somebody needs to
be because there are too

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:84%
many interesting
things that happen--

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could we have
that kind of technology?

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Wow.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:90%
We could.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.969 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if we do.

00:17:29.969 --> 00:17:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would
be pretty amazing.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But you always--
conspiracy theorists

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.290 align:middle line:84%
say that we do have a lot
more than we're divulging.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:90%
We probably do.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.590 align:middle line:90%
We're probably 10 years ahead.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did your
colleagues tell you about this?

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: My colleagues
were blown away.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.355 align:middle line:84%
You don't get a radar
case like this anymore.

00:17:50.355 --> 00:17:51.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't get the
audio and the radar--

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:52.140 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
hear the pilot.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yeah.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So it was just--
it's a cool case.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.490 align:middle line:10%
And for me, it's a case
that will never be closed,

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.410 align:middle line:10%
because I think
that once you have

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.170 align:middle line:10%
a sighting in a
specific area, that it

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:10%
will show you a pattern.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we don't-- as
investigators, as researchers,

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:84%
we aren't good at
looking at the patterns.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we absolutely have

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:84%
to go with this if we're going
to step forward with research.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're observing us.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
they want with us?

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.517 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I don't know
if they're studying us.

00:18:27.517 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they're
utilizing something.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they abducting us?

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I believe that
they are abducting us.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I do.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:33.620 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Genetic testing.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Haven't they done
enough over all these years?

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: You would think they
would get a little bored,

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:90%
but who knows?

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.980 align:middle line:84%
See, I think-- and David
Jacobs has a theory

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.490 align:middle line:90%
that it's very nefarious.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.500 align:middle line:90%
That it's not good.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I think they're replacing
us with hybrids.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're here
on the planet now.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But I think one day, we're
going to have 10 million

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:84%
of these creatures plopped
down on the planet,

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.420 align:middle line:90%
and we're history.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.920 align:middle line:90%
I think that's their plan.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.337 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I think that there
is evidence to support that.

00:19:13.337 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hope I'm wrong.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: I know.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:90%
I hope so too.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But I think that unless we
get people that are really

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
serious researchers looking into
this, we're not going to know.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And this could be
the end of humanity.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:90%
We need to get going on this.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they know that
our current species might not

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:84%
survive a planetary change,
but the ones they're

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
making and seeding will.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're extinct,
they bring the other ones in

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:90%
to keep this planet going.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.374 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I like
that plan. [LAUGHS]

00:19:49.374 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:84%
That might not have be
bad at the rate-- well,

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.831 align:middle line:84%
I mean at the rate
we're going, we're

00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:55.750 align:middle line:84%
so kind to our environment
and all the creatures

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think that you can go down
the road of Dr. Carla Turner.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.189 align:middle line:90%
You can go Phil Schneider.

00:20:07.189 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:90%
You can do all of these things.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I get so
terrified by the possibilities

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.030 align:middle line:90%
of what is truly happening.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But then I have to pull
myself back and say, OK.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a lot
of factual information

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:84%
about this, so is
that truly happening?

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got
the Steven Greer camp,

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that it's all love and light and
beings communicating with us.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think the truth probably
lies perhaps somewhere

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.180 align:middle line:90%
in the middle.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somewhere
in the middle.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you have some
benevolent races and some

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:90%
that are not.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:38.625 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Right.

00:20:38.625 --> 00:20:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.884 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that they
have their own agenda.

00:20:40.884 --> 00:20:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: They do.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I got
interested in this back

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:84%
during the Barney and
Betty Hill case, a long,

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:84%
long time ago, when
"Look" magazine

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:90%
did "The Interrupted Journey."

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yes.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.046 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: John Fuller's book.

00:20:53.046 --> 00:20:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And we got involved in that
and kept reading about it.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:84%
One of my first radio interviews
was with the psychiatrist,

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Benjamin Simon.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.090 align:middle line:84%
My first radio
interview on my own

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
was with Stanton
Friedman, the UFOlogist.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But that's what evolved
me into all this.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've come up with my own
theories that do they exist?

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:90%
Are they visiting us?

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Have they been visiting us?

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, why?

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose?

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And I really think they have
a hybrid program underway,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:90%
for whatever reason.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing I
haven't figured out yet.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I've speculated, as
I just mentioned,

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a
replacement thing.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:84%
But something indeed is
happening on this planet.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: And I think if
anybody would come up

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:84%
with a great theory about
that, that would be you

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.550 align:middle line:84%
because you've had so
much experience talking

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:84%
to all the leading
researchers in the field.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there have
been some good ones.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.826 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yeah, I know.

00:21:51.826 --> 00:21:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we've
lost some good ones,

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
like Dr. John Mack and
Budd Hopkins, people

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:90%
like that in the field.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: We have.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
right now, we're

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.920 align:middle line:84%
in a really pivotal
time in UFOlogy.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.720 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
people that have done--

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, spent decades, 50
years, researching this,

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and they've got their files
stored in bins somewhere.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And if something were
to happen to them, where

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:90%
does that research go?

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And I really think
that we need to work

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:84%
hard as a younger generation
coming into this to make sure

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:84%
that information
is saved, archived,

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and accessible to all of us
that are researching this.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if we can get
all of that information

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:84%
in a central location, we
could make great strides

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.871 align:middle line:90%
in figuring out what this is.

00:22:37.871 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These orb
objects that you look at,

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:90%
are they solid or not?

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: Sometimes they
appear to be solid,

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we have accounts
of witnesses who see them up

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.390 align:middle line:84%
close, and they appear
to be this plasma-like--

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a plasma
around maybe a physical craft?

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: It very well could be.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But you just get lots
of different-- I've

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:84%
talked to a couple people
who have witnessed this,

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's just this
turning, churning motion

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.850 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the orb.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:12.290 align:middle line:84%
People get the impression
that it is alive, almost.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's fascinating.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.940 align:middle line:90%
It responds to people.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.170 align:middle line:84%
So it definitely has an
intelligence behind it.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I go back to what happened
over in Hessdalen,

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:84%
because Erlang Strand and his
group of researchers over there

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:84%
had a laser pointer and would
point it at the objects,

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
kind of like Steven Greer will
do, and the objects will--

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:90%
it responded back.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.765 align:middle line:90%
So it's fascinating.

00:23:37.765 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
they're alive,

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.190 align:middle line:90%
with intelligence behind it.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:84%
We get reports of
small orbs, almost

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
like the size of quarters,
also flying all over the place.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:90%
So what could they be?

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: Are they
some sort of probe?

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.110 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be on a mission.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting
that when you see--

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.952 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or could
they be ant-sized ETs?

00:23:57.952 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: They could be.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I have heard people that have
had these experiences say

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
that they'll see the orb, and
then some ET like creature

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:90%
comes out of the orb.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Up in Skinwalker Ranch, Colm
Kelleher and George Knapp.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I think they wrote about this
in "Hunt For the Skinwalker"

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.910 align:middle line:84%
when there was this
light, and then creatures

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:90%
got out of the object.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just the whole thing
is fascinating and frightening.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- I
want to know more.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.346 align:middle line:90%
But how do we do that?

00:24:30.346 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I'm in the
process of assembling people

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:84%
from all over the
world because there

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
are great people out
there that have made

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:84%
the investment in
good equipment,

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:45.180 align:middle line:84%
know how to take reports, and
we are going to define protocols

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.382 align:middle line:90%
for each and every person.

00:24:46.382 --> 00:24:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're not
getting help from government.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.397 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: Not that
I know-- I wish.

00:24:50.397 --> 00:24:51.230 align:middle line:90%
That would be great.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would have
really help solve the issue.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Then they may already
know what it is.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: They may.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.730 align:middle line:84%
You always get reports from
both sides of the camp.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The government knows all about
it, they're meeting with ETs.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you hear people
that say they don't really

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:84%
know about it, and that's
why they're not telling

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:90%
the citizens about this.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So be it.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's check some
emails here for you.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.550 align:middle line:90%
Jenny from New Hampshire.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Do you really see disclosure
happening within the next 20

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.190 align:middle line:90%
years?

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I think
that disclosure--

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:90%
I think it's happening.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a soft disclosure,
like many other people do.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we'll ever see
the President get on TV and say,

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:90%
they've landed.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:90%
There here.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
But I think when you see NASA
having a press conference,

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
saying that within
the next few years,

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:84%
they will more than likely
be announcing that they've

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:46.641 align:middle line:84%
found life, when you have
Podesta pushing for disclosure

00:25:46.641 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:90%
of government documents.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Saying that it's
one of his biggest regrets

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't get the answers
while he was in government.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:90%
So he wants back in.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yeah.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And then Clinton coming
out and making her comment

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:90%
about Area 51.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that they know
that something is going--

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:90%
that they can't stop this.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just--
it's a tidal wave.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And now with the
privatization of space,

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:14.330 align:middle line:84%
you can't hide it because
people will go up there and see.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think our
astronauts saw anything

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:90%
on the moon?

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: I would wonder.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a very
good possibility.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hear
conflicting stories.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:84%
There was one case that
Buzz Aldrin, our second man

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:84%
to walk on the moon, has denied
every time I've seen interviews

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.120 align:middle line:90%
with him or interviewed him.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.792 align:middle line:84%
Has denied that they saw
anything on the moon.

00:26:36.792 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another
clip where apparently,

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.880 align:middle line:84%
a few years ago, he talked
about things that they saw.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
what's going on there.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Oh, I know.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's confusing.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: It is confusing.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are so
many cool areas to focus on

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.360 align:middle line:90%
for research.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And I wish that I had
enough time in my life

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.100 align:middle line:84%
to focus on the historical
aspect with regard

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.600 align:middle line:84%
to the moon landing and
really delve into that.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:84%
But man, I've got so
many other places to go.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roger from
Salt Lake City.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Are aliens walking among us now?

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: I would be-- my
gut says, yes, they are.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.840 align:middle line:90%
But that's a belief.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:90%
That--

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they look like us.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Or we look like them.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: I would think so.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.870 align:middle line:90%
But again, this is speculation.

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.030 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
I have not researched.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I think you've got
both camps on that.

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.316 align:middle line:90%
But I would be willing to bet.

00:27:33.316 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.290 align:middle line:90%
And then Marcy from Florida.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:41.340 align:middle line:84%
She says, what excites you
the most about UFOlogy?

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: I love-- oh my gosh.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.021 align:middle line:84%
I just get to have one answer
for that, or can I-- you know.

00:27:47.021 --> 00:27:48.311 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can have a couple.

00:27:48.311 --> 00:27:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: [LAUGHS]
Well, thank you.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The thing about UFOlogy
that I find so exciting

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.950 align:middle line:84%
is that we're dealing with a
subject that is life changing.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this will
rewrite history.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.720 align:middle line:84%
This will change
everything we know.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that is
beyond exciting.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
It is incredibly important
that we look into this

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.290 align:middle line:90%
and we take this seriously.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is phenomenal.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.750 align:middle line:84%
We've got this
other intelligence

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.320 align:middle line:90%
interacting with us.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And is it something that
we could learn from?

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Could we figure out
different means for energy?

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:25.620 align:middle line:84%
It's such a multi-layered,
fascinating subject.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.330 align:middle line:90%
So I love that part of it.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Erica, I'm going
to give you some names.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I want you to tell
me the episode.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: OK.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chris Bledsoe.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.732 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: Chris
Bledsoe is a person

00:28:36.732 --> 00:28:38.190 align:middle line:84%
that I have come
into contact with.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed him
a couple weeks ago.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:43.140 align:middle line:84%
He was-- back in
2007, he was out

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.800 align:middle line:84%
fishing with his son, who
was 17 years old at the time,

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and two of his
coworkers or employees.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were out there, and
he wasn't feeling really great.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:90%
He had Crohn's disease.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So he was just not in a good
place, and so he wandered off,

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and he noticed-- he
saw these two orbs.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:04.414 align:middle line:90%
These big objects.

00:29:04.414 --> 00:29:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Orange orbs, right?

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yeah.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And the objects-- he
was shocked and stunned,

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and he felt that they
were watching him.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And so he crouched down
and was trying to hide.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And then he stumbles back to
camp, and his son isn't there.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And he's frantically trying to
figure out where his son is.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
people, the two other men

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:84%
that he was with,
they were panicked,

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.320 align:middle line:84%
because they had realized
that Chris-- Chris was

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.272 align:middle line:90%
gone for a while.

00:29:36.272 --> 00:29:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He just disappeared?

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: He did.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.152 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't really have memory
of any of that at the time.

00:29:42.152 --> 00:29:44.360 align:middle line:84%
It was like, well, this has
been a five minute thing.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Now he's back.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:84%
But he finally finds his son,
who is in absolute hysterics.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking about these
creatures, and oh Daddy,

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.420 align:middle line:84%
why could-- why did
you let this happen?

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
absolutely terrified.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And so they just said, we've
got to get out of here.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Because they see
the objects again,

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.040 align:middle line:84%
this time on the other
side of the river.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.360 align:middle line:90%
They abandoned everything.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.530 align:middle line:84%
They dropped their fishing
poles, left the gear,

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:90%
got in their car, their truck.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And as they're in their
truck, one of the fellows

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.950 align:middle line:84%
looks back behind and
sees this creature

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.840 align:middle line:84%
running on all fours
following the truck.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I don't
know what you would do.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:27.169 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Put your
foot to the pedal.

00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: But I mean,
that would be the most

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.014 align:middle line:90%
terrifying experience.

00:30:31.014 --> 00:30:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I can't comprehend
how terrifying.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they describe
the creature as looking like?

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:35.908 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: You know what?

00:30:35.908 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of a hairless
humanoid-type creature

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.130 align:middle line:90%
that was on all fours.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:47.532 align:middle line:84%
And they see this, and they
are thinking, oh my god.

00:30:47.532 --> 00:30:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Then they see that
the objects that

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:84%
are blocking their
entrance onto the freeway

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.330 align:middle line:90%
to get out of there.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And so they pull up
to this trailer home.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.480 align:middle line:84%
This trailer that was out
there with the door open.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:90%
The TV's blaring.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Chris gets right
up to the door--

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
a horror movie.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Oh my god.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It was the worst horror
movie imaginable.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So they're right up
next to the door.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:84%
He is honking the horn,
just feverishly, trying

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:90%
to get anybody to answer.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:90%
They're banging on the door.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Nobody answers.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, they
just get back home.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And a day later, I believe
it was a day later,

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.000 align:middle line:84%
they went back to
the home and said,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.489 align:middle line:84%
hey, we were here
in fear of our life.

00:31:25.489 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:90%
What were you guys doing?

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:27.863 align:middle line:90%
And they said, oh, we were here.

00:31:27.863 --> 00:31:28.960 align:middle line:90%
We were watching TV.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With the door open.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Not coming to.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Right.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.056 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird.

00:31:33.056 --> 00:31:35.876 align:middle line:84%
How about the case
of Delbert Newhouse.

00:31:35.876 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: You know, the
Delbert Newhouse thing

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:90%
is really intriguing to me.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you've seen
the Newhouse footage.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But it is an old, kind of a Blue
Bookish type case, where you've

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.430 align:middle line:84%
got this fellow who
was in the military,

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.980 align:middle line:90%
and he's out in Tremonton, Utah.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And he sees these
spherical objects.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything's
happening in Utah.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: Well,
you're not kidding.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.150 align:middle line:90%
In more ways than one.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.600 align:middle line:84%
We won't even get into the
politics, but you know.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So he gets his camera out
and videotapes these objects.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see, if you
go on to YouTube or something,

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.390 align:middle line:84%
you can see an
interview with him.

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:19.000 align:middle line:90%
And they analyzed this footage.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this footage was
put under intense scrutiny

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.830 align:middle line:84%
along with the Montana
case about the same time.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And they really
couldn't figure it out.

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.110 align:middle line:84%
But then, of course, they had
to come out and say eventually

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:34.850 align:middle line:90%
that it was a flock of birds.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:37.840 align:middle line:84%
You know how that
went back in the day.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.360 align:middle line:90%
It still is kind of like that.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's very intriguing
to hear his testimony,

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.850 align:middle line:84%
to see him testifying and
talking about the case.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:47.480 align:middle line:90%
To see the footage.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And so now my goal is to
really look into that case

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and try to find more
information out about it.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could
be a great case.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: And the Montana case.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Both of them.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.550 align:middle line:90%
Tie them together.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Yeah.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: O'Hare Airport.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I remember that case.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Did not people see some
kind of donut-shaped object

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:90%
going through the clouds?

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: They saw a very
large disk-like object

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:84%
that was hovering above
one of the runways.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think a crew on the ground
observed it and everybody,

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.380 align:middle line:84%
from my understanding,
the people in the tower,

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.120 align:middle line:84%
everybody was
observing this object.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was there for quite some
time, and then it just shot up,

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and there was a big hole in
the clouds where it shot up.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this was
around the same time

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:37.670 align:middle line:84%
the Stephenville,
Texas sighting was.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:39.070 align:middle line:90%
They seem to go in flaps.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: They do.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:41.200 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
O'Hare thing that I

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.090 align:middle line:84%
find so intriguing
is we've never

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.980 align:middle line:90%
seen any footage released.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.781 align:middle line:90%
People took photos.

00:33:49.781 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.500 align:middle line:90%
We had photos.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: But there's not a lot.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard
rumors-- again, this

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.560 align:middle line:84%
could be just the conspiracy
theory kind of things.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.427 align:middle line:84%
But I heard rumors that Akroyd,
Dan Akroyd, bought the footage.

00:34:02.427 --> 00:34:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you, Erica?

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.400 align:middle line:84%
What keeps pushing
you in this field?

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.270 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:08.120 align:middle line:90%
What are you looking for?

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.078 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: You know what?

00:34:09.078 --> 00:34:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I want to make the
biggest change that I can.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I go to bed
at night and think,

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.820 align:middle line:90%
how can I change the world?

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.042 align:middle line:84%
How can I help people
to take this seriously?

00:34:19.042 --> 00:34:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know that feeling.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.219 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: I know you do.

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
other wonderful men

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and women in this field
that feel the same way.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.679 align:middle line:84%
But we're at a
really pivotal time.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:32.780 align:middle line:84%
We've got all of these brilliant
people that are passing away.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:84%
We have-- you go to
conferences and symposiums,

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.639 align:middle line:84%
the average age is
60 or over, and it's

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:41.260 align:middle line:84%
the same people,
which is wonderful,

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.219 align:middle line:84%
but we need to mobilize
a younger generation.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We need to excite
people and teach people

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that this can be scientifically
and must be scientifically

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.670 align:middle line:90%
explored and studied.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:56.389 align:middle line:84%
And we need to change
the sentiment in America.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:35:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so crazy
here, and the field

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.770 align:middle line:90%
has really taken a nosedive.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And we need to bring over
people like Erling Strand

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:84%
from Hessdalen, who goes out
twice a year with his kids

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.940 align:middle line:84%
at Ostfold University,
and he teaches them.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.320 align:middle line:90%
He has a science camp.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Goes out there to explore
unexplained phenomena.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how cool is that?

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.175 align:middle line:90%
We need to do that here.

00:35:20.175 --> 00:35:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.600 align:middle line:90%
We need more and more of that.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: We do.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you?

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: They can go on
Facebook, UFO Classified or UFO

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Classified.com.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.050 align:middle line:90%
So give me the orb stories.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:32.850 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Orbs you specialize in.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: I do.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.600 align:middle line:90%
I am--

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And can you rule
out that they're spirits?

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: No, I can't.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: But what
I really hope to do

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.350 align:middle line:84%
is train people to
be better observers.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.130 align:middle line:90%
So how do you rule out aircraft?

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.950 align:middle line:84%
How do you rule out
Chinese lanterns?

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:52.770 align:middle line:84%
How do you know
they're not drones?

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:55.102 align:middle line:10%
I'm planning on, really,
with my new group,

00:35:55.102 --> 00:35:56.560 align:middle line:10%
I've got a new
group in Utah I just

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.010 align:middle line:10%
put together, Unexplained Utah.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.810 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to be
adding educational material.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, people will become
better observers and witnesses.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Should we be concerned?

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Should we be scared about this?

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Or should we be enlightened?

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Oh boy.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.240 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.090 align:middle line:84%
I would like to think we
should be enlightened.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.090 align:middle line:90%
But we need to be cautious.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:20.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:21.806 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just in case.

00:36:21.806 --> 00:36:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Just in case.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Gotta be on our toes.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:24.880 align:middle line:90%
But we can't wait.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the worst
they could do to us?

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Well-- [LAUGHS].

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a cookbook.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:30.320 align:middle line:90%
"To Serve Man."

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: Is that--
well, you never know.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:32.530 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:33.710 align:middle line:90%
The Soylent Green.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.429 align:middle line:84%

a subject matter

00:36:40.524 --> 00:36:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that we've
