>>ROBERT FELIX: We're standing
in Kerry Park overlooking

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.325 align:middle line:84%
the city of Seattle with
the Space Needle here.

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:11.100 align:middle line:84%
If it weren't quite
so cloudy, you

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.590 align:middle line:84%
could see Mount Rainier rising
into the sky in the background.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.860 align:middle line:84%
16,000 years ago, this entire
area, all the way-- everything

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.370 align:middle line:84%
you can see was buried beneath
3,000 to 4,000 feet of ice.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm talking
more than a half

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:84%
a mile of ice, more than
one kilometer of ice

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
straight up from
where I'm standing.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Robert Felix, author
of "Not by Fire But by Ice,"

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
and I'm here to warn
you that the next ice

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:90%
age could begin any day.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd like to explain why,
so please stay put and prepare

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.390 align:middle line:84%
yourself for a
fascinating episode

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.534 align:middle line:84%
of "Beyond Belief"
with George Noory.

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.116 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
to believe anymore

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:00.793 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
the information.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:17.252 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.252 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Fascinating indeed.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:10%
And of course, Robert
Felix is with us.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:10%
Robert, that's kind of
scary, I got to tell you.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.110 align:middle line:10%
>>FELIX: It is really scary.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:10%
And right now, I live
in the Seattle area,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:10%
but my wife and I
have been looking

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:10%
for other locations
that might be safer--

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: --a little bit
further south, not that much,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:90%
but a little.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.211 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people
will say, come on,

00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be
thousands of years from now.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
The point is, based on talking
to you for so many years

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and especially on
"Coast to Coast AM,"

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a gradual
increase that can still

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.070 align:middle line:84%
cause incredible
havoc, can't it?

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:10%
>>FELIX: Well, actually,
it's not so gradual,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:10%
because up until
the 1990s, I think

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:10%
scientists pretty
much believed that.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:84%
But there was a project called
GRIP, Greenland Ice Core

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Project.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:10%
I think it was in 1989 that they
drilled into the ice in Central

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.522 align:middle line:10%
Greenland, and they went
down more than two miles

00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:10%
so that they could
pull up these 4 inch--

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.105 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: These cores.

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: --cores, yeah, and they
could study the ice that was--

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.135 align:middle line:84%
or the snow that was deposited
as much as 250,000 years ago.

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:28.010 align:middle line:84%
At first, they didn't
believe their own study

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:84%
so they didn't
publish this for--

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they baffled?

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.188 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: They were
totally baffled.

00:02:32.188 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
It showed that the ice ages had
begun in less than 20 years.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:84%
So they studied
more, and more people

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:90%
were getting those same results.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, what they
finally came up with

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
is that every ice age in the
last quarter million years

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.667 align:middle line:84%
began in less than 20 years--
sometimes as short as 10 years

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:90%
or even three years.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that in time.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Just like that.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing is-- well, the
big one that I'll talk about

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.254 align:middle line:84%
is there was something
called the Eemian period.

00:03:03.254 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eemian.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: "Ee-mi-an."

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Eemian.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this was from
about 127,000 years ago

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:84%
to 115,000 years ago, which
ended with a magnetic reversal,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.840 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the Eemian period
was even warmer than today.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, we descended into a
full-fledged glacial severity

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:90%
in less than 20 years.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I'm saying that when
it comes, it comes in a hurry.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it doesn't
take much to disrupt

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:90%
a person's life, right?

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, no.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.219 align:middle line:10%
Well--

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.325 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One bad season
could screw you up.

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: That could.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And you know, and I see--
well, I see the evidence now

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:90%
that it's starting to come.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.836 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just in July there was
this record cold across so much

00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:57.210 align:middle line:84%
of the United States,
across the plains,

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.820 align:middle line:84%
across the Southeast
and the East.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing more
and more of that,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and we're having more and
more record snows every year.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So I fear that we're
entering that 20 year period.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Having been
raised in the Midwest,

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:84%
we had a lot of discussions
about the lakes freezing over.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And there would be some seasons
that lakes would freeze over

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:90%
in its entirety.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:84%
The Detroit River
would freeze up.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.470 align:middle line:90%
Lake Erie would freeze up.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Lake Superior would
start freezing up.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:84%
It played an incredible havoc
on shipping and commerce

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.102 align:middle line:84%
Do you see that as a
commonplace occurrence?

00:04:39.102 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, yes.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And I see that-- I mean, just
look at this last winter,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.322 align:middle line:84%
is that the Great Lakes did
freeze more than at-- well, no,

00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say
any time on record,

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:90%
but certainly more than--

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.989 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a long time.

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: --any time since
satellite records began,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
is that 92% of the Great
Lakes were ice-covered.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:10%
There were some people
talking about maybe

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.583 align:middle line:10%
they'd be able to
take a snowmobile all

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:05.567 align:middle line:10%
the way from Chicago
to Canada, and--

00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They might
have been able to.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:10%
>>FELIX: They might
have been able to.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.806 align:middle line:10%
They might have.

00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And US Steel, they shut down
their production because they

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:84%
weren't-- you know, they ship
their iron ore by the Great

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Lakes, and they
weren't able to do it.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we're looking
at these things,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:84%
to me, that indicate
something's going on right now.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then of course,
it gets warm, it melts.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But then it comes back
with another rough season.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.214 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so wintertime this year
could be a disaster, right?

00:05:34.214 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, it could.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the hallmarks
of entering an ice age

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:90%
is extremes.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.790 align:middle line:10%
And where I learned
about this, there

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:10%
was a scientist in the
United Kingdom, H.H. Lamb.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.790 align:middle line:10%
Hubert H. Lamb, I think
his first name was.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:10%
But he studied
climatology for years.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:84%
He was probably one of
the world's greatest

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
climatologists, wrote several
books on the Little Ice Age.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:84%
But he pointed out that our
entry is a time of extremes.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And he said, for instance,
going into the Little Ice Age,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:84%
there were areas
of the world that

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.739 align:middle line:84%
had the worst
droughts in 300 years.

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're having that now.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well then
later that year,

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
same location, same year,
they had the worst snowstorms

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:90%
in 500 years.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:90%
So yeah--

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the
droughts went away,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.220 align:middle line:84%
but they got replaced
with something else.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.845 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Right.

00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And so these extremes
that I'm seeing now

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
that I know that some
of the media are saying

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
global warming, I

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:84%
go, no, they have to
do with this cycle.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.240 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's a cycle, it's
a cycle, it's a cycle.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And if we could just get that
into our computer models,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.870 align:middle line:84%
we'd be seeing a
different scenario.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Last winter,
we had a rough season

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:90%
where a lot of cattle died.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:84%
They simply froze to
death, and farmers

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any
place to take them.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:84%
There were tens of
thousands of dead cattle.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
They had to-- at least
until things thawed out,

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.050 align:middle line:84%
they were just left out
there on the fields of ice.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Yeah, that
was, what, South Dakota,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.264 align:middle line:84%
and I think that was like last
October, something like that.

00:07:05.264 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Decimating to them.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: More than 100,000
cattle in South Dakota.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: They were gone.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
What had happened is
they had huge rainstorms,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:84%
so these poor cattle
were all wet and soaked.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.722 align:middle line:84%
And then came this huge
snowstorm-- 4 feet of snow.

00:07:20.722 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They froze to death.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Now, how do you
move in 4 feet of snow?

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:90%
A cow can't.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you can't eat.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.922 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: And what the cattle
apparently did is-- this

00:07:28.922 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
is part of their DNA,
whatever-- but they

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.470 align:middle line:84%
all moved into lower
locations because it would

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.804 align:middle line:84%
be a little bit warmer
in the lower locations.

00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:84%
But then that's when the
wind started blowing.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:84%
That's when the snow
started accumulating.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.571 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, they
froze to death, yeah.

00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could
happen to people, too.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.861 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: That could
happen to people.

00:07:47.861 --> 00:07:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it's
not just South Dakota.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
That happened last
year in Bolivia.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Something like 70,000 cattle
were killed by huge snowstorms.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And then this spring in
Bolivia, another 60,000.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.077 align:middle line:84%
So oh yeah, it could happen
with-- now, at least,

00:08:04.077 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:90%
people were a little bit warned.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.344 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if
we'll be warned in time.

00:08:09.344 --> 00:08:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And of course that
beef, even though it's frozen,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.610 align:middle line:90%
is-- you can't use it.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, it's lost.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And these farmers, they don't
have insurance for something

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.630 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So it wiped out a
lot of ranchers.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 100,000.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.624 align:middle line:10%
>>FELIX: 100,000 in
South Dakota alone, yes.

00:08:26.624 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What about the sun?

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.170 align:middle line:10%
Does the sun play
havoc with any of this?

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Oh, I think the sun
has everything to do with it.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:84%
And what we're looking
at-- the reason

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I say that is a big
part of it is sunspots.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:10%
And sunspots are areas
of magnetic turbulence

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:10%
on the sun that
are actually cooler

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:10%
than the rest of the sun.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:10%
But there's a strong correlation
between times of low sunspot

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:10%
activity and it getting
cooler on Earth.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And the one I'll
bring up, really,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:84%
is during the Little
Ice Age, there

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:84%
was a period of about 40 years
when there were no sunspots.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 40 years?

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Yeah, about 40 years.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:84%
It's known as the-- Now, we
were able to find that out

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:84%
because Galileo had
invented the telescope.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:10%
Before that, we
really didn't know.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But scientists were able to
look up there and study the sky.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And for about 40 years, none.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:10%
And it's called the
Maunder Minimum.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:10%
And that is when the
Little Ice Age came along.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:10%
And also, it appears that
volcanic activity increases

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.670 align:middle line:10%
during these times
of lower sunspots.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, right now-- and
this is according to NASA.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:90%
This is not my imagination.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Right now, sunspot
activity is the lowest

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
it has been in more
than 100 years.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.580 align:middle line:10%
And 100 years ago, or
a little bit more that,

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:10%
is that's when we had what
was called the Dalton Minimum,

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:10%
a period of very low
sunspot activity.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:84%
That was sunspot
cycle number five.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in sunspot
cycle number 24.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 24.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: And when
you look at a graph

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and see how today's rise
and fall of the intensity

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.450 align:middle line:84%
follows sunspot
cycle five so closely

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of scientists
are now saying-- well,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.650 align:middle line:84%
there's landscheidt.info--
no, landscheidt.com

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:84%
is a website run by Geoff
Sharp who keeps track of this.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, NASA, when they're
tracking sunspots,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:84%
they're using all of
today's technology,

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:84%
so they're seeing more sunspots
than might have occurred

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.280 align:middle line:84%
during the Dalton Minimum
or the Maunder Minimum.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at the sun
using the same technology

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.040 align:middle line:84%
as they had back then, we are
matching it almost perfectly.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And so Geoff Sharp
keeps track of that.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at that chart,
you realize we are on our way,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.579 align:middle line:84%
at least, to a Dalton Minimum,
maybe to a Maunder Minimum.

00:10:57.579 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I think we're headed
for a Maunder Minimum.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.453 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, one the things
we're concerned about,

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Robert, of course, X-flares
from the sun, which

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:84%
could play havoc
with our power grid.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And our campaign, of
course, is to get the power

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:84%
grid insulated, protected,
against something like that.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
don't factor in the fact

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.210 align:middle line:84%
that sunspots also can play
around with the weather.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, yes, so much.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are some scientists
out there who say, no, sunspots

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:90%
have nothing to do with this.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But there are others,
like the astrophysicist

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
that I talked about,
who absolutely

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:84%
say sunspots have everything
to do with the weather.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.220 align:middle line:84%
This Piers Corbyn
that I mentioned,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
he was able to predict the
polar vortex reaching low

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
down into the United
States last winter,

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
long before any of the official
scientists were able to do it.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:84%
The UK Met Office has, what,
$40 million worth of computers.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
As near as I can tell,
Piers is working at home

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.360 align:middle line:90%
with a little laptop.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.980 align:middle line:84%
But because he knows
what's actually happening,

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.670 align:middle line:90%
he's able to tell us the truth.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many undersea
volcanoes are there

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, and what are
they contributing to this?

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.055 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, I think everything.

00:12:11.055 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that will be
my contribution eventually.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:84%
When I started writing
the book back in 1991,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:84%
scientists thought there were
10,000 underwater volcanoes

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:90%
in the entire world.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Active?

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: No, just 10,000 total.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And at least the
ones that are active

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.830 align:middle line:84%
are pumping lava into the sea
that's 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.900 align:middle line:84%
hot, so we're talking
a lot of heat there.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.170 align:middle line:84%
But that was 10,000
underwater volcanoes.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 1993, they
discovered another 1,100

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
underwater volcanoes off
the coast of Easter Island.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:90%
So in just a matter of months--

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just in one area?

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.663 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Yeah, in one area,
in a matter of months,

00:12:54.663 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:84%
they increased the world's
supply of underwater volcanoes

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:90%
by 10%.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, now-- I mean,
they were so far off.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, NASA estimates that
there are more than three

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.297 align:middle line:90%
million underwater volcanoes.

00:13:08.297 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: And they estimate--
and again, not all of those

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:90%
are active.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.143 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's like simmering
a pot of water, isn't it?

00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, to me, it is.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:84%
They're not all active,
but they estimate

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that there are probably
at least 140,000

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.000 align:middle line:90%
of them that are active.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, look at what's happening
in Iceland right now.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what do
you mean by active?

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.221 align:middle line:10%
>>FELIX: Active, I mean--

00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:29.917 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Volcanoes are
spewing ash, underwater?

00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:10%
>>FELIX: Underwater.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:10%
Not ash, necessarily, but just
magma that's coming up slowly.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're talking
about the above-water

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
volcanoes, they have to force
their way up through miles of--

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:42.956 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of water.

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:90%
The pressure holds it down.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, but when it's
above earth, above the water,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:84%
they've got to push up through
the earth, essentially.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.694 align:middle line:84%
Whereas down next
to the water, they

00:13:53.694 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:84%
can just-- when they're
below the water,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.069 align:middle line:84%
they don't have all
that soil above them.

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:58.526 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just
kind of oozes out.

00:13:58.526 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:10%
>>FELIX: They just
kind of ooze up out.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.710 align:middle line:84%
But scientists are finding more
underwater volcanoes every day.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
the name of it is,

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.380 align:middle line:84%
but just this summer,
they discovered

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:84%
the biggest underwater volcanic
concept that they've seen.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.965 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've probably
talked about Bardarbunga,

00:14:18.965 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:90%
a volcano in Iceland.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it, yeah.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Well, let's face it.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.020 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
always ready to go.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:24.801 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Yes.

00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's part of
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
that has come up
out of the water.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
But that Mid-Atlantic Ridge
is like more than 10,000 miles

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.782 align:middle line:84%
It's made up entirely
of volcanoes.

00:14:36.782 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:90%
How many of those are active?

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.720 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.382 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:39.382 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Now, in the-- I'll
give a different example.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.050 align:middle line:84%
We do hear about the Arctic
ice melting as opposed

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.980 align:middle line:90%
to Antarctic.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:10%
I hope we can get to that.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:10%
But when I was writing
the book, scientists

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:10%
couldn't quite understand
how this happened.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.770 align:middle line:84%
But even though during
the last ice age,

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:01.010 align:middle line:84%
even though Canada was covered
by one to two miles of ice,

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:84%
the Arctic Ocean was
no more ice-covered

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:90%
than it is right now.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:10%
And they couldn't
understand why.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.482 align:middle line:90%
Well, they didn't--

00:15:08.482 --> 00:15:09.398 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know why.

00:15:09.398 --> 00:15:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: They didn't know
about the Gakkel Ridge.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:84%
There is a chain of
underwater volcanoes

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:84%
beneath the water in the
Arctic Ocean that's called--

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Heating up the water.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, this chain, it's
bigger than the Alps, actually.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:90%
It's 1,100 miles long.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:90%
It's all underwater.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, scientists thought
it wasn't active.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
But a few years ago,
the Max Planck Society

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:90%
sent down submersibles.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And the Gakkel
Ridge is so active

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:84%
that they had to
be careful that it

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.350 align:middle line:84%
didn't melt some
of their cables.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: So to me, that is what
is keeping the Arctic Ocean

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:90%
warmer than the other areas.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the magma hits
the water, what happens?

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well,
I've seen pictures

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:84%
of the underwater smokers,
is that essentially,

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.830 align:middle line:90%
it just comes out.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:84%
You can see the little
explosions, so to speak.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, that's
where the kinds of metals

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.960 align:middle line:84%
that are rare metals
that accumulate there.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And there are kinds
of shrimp that

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.330 align:middle line:84%
seem to survive-- thrive--
in this 800 degree water.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But I'm looking
at-- because I don't

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:84%
deny that what the-- the
ocean has been warming.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.370 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
humans are heating it.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:84%
I think it's coming
from the way down there,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is that those
underwater volcanoes are

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:90%
heating the ocean.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's a
contributing factor here,

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.898 align:middle line:84%
because we had talked in
our previous "Beyond Belief"

00:16:30.898 --> 00:16:33.330 align:middle line:90%
show about a magnetic reversal.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:10%
So you include a magnetic
reversal; underwater volcanoes;

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.230 align:middle line:10%
sunspots, or lack of--
all this is hitting us

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.210 align:middle line:10%
at the same time
right now, Robert.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.407 align:middle line:90%
What does this all mean?

00:16:45.407 --> 00:16:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: All of it is
hitting us at the same time.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I'm seeing is as
the underwater volcanoes heat

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:84%
the oceans, then they're
causing more evaporation,

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
so more and more moisture
is rising into the sky.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
the sky is being

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:84%
cooled by the
above-water volcanoes.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.609 align:middle line:84%
So you've got what I say is
warmer oceans and colder skies.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:90%
That is a recipe for disaster.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're in
this disaster, right now?

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: As near as
I can see, and it

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
appears that volcanic activity
is heavier than it has been.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:26.109 align:middle line:84%
I say, it appears
because scientists

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:84%
didn't used to be able to keep
track of volcanic activity

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And so some
scientists are saying,

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:84%
no, there's no more
volcanic activity

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:84%
than usual, it's just that we
didn't know about the other.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:90%
I think there is.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at magnetic
reversal-- for instance,

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:84%
the Gothenburg magnetic
reversal that I mentioned

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:51.110 align:middle line:84%
11,500 years ago, they have
found piles of mammoth bones

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:84%
in Alaska interspersed
with volcanic ash, all

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
at the same time as
the magnetic reversal.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And in-- well, in
Washington state,

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:84%
they had that-- the Glacial
Lake Missoula floods.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they have found
a tremendous amount

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
of ash from Mount
St. Helens that's

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:84%
interspersed with
the flood deposits.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So again, all of these things
happen at the same time.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a product of
disasters, isn't it--

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.506 align:middle line:90%
a recipe for disaster.

00:18:24.506 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: It is.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I think
we could survive.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:84%
If we knew what was
coming, I think we could.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the
ice age that you

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.169 align:middle line:84%
believe we're in is not going
to blanket the planet, right?

00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, right.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there could be some
regions that you can escape to.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Absolutely.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.525 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, I had
mentioned that I

00:18:42.525 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:84%
am looking further south
from Olympia, Washington.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
But again, if somebody
would look at the map--

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I have a map on my website
that shows where the ice

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:84%
sheets extended during
the last ice age.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And the ice
extended-- it covered

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:01.046 align:middle line:84%
all of Seattle-- 3,000
to 4,000 feet of ice.

00:19:01.046 --> 00:19:02.420 align:middle line:84%
But then it moved
slightly lower.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can't imagine that.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.835 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Oh, yeah--
3,000 to 4,000.

00:19:04.835 --> 00:19:06.542 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's more
than half a mile.

00:19:06.542 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
being on Europa.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Yeah, that's more than
a half a mile, straight up.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.500 align:middle line:84%
How do you escape that, unless
you get out before it happens.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it went
up into Montana.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Then it followed
glacial Lake Missoula

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.386 align:middle line:84%
so that on the north side--
not Glacial Lake Missoula,

00:19:24.386 --> 00:19:26.040 align:middle line:90%
the Missoula river.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
But on the north side
of the Missoula River,

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
there was a cliff of ice
about 15 stories high.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
On the south side
of the river, you

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.400 align:middle line:84%
could have survived
quite easily.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:84%
All of Chicago was
covered with ice.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it went down
as far as Saint Louis.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to look at
my map to make sure.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:84%
But all of New England,
all six states,

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle line:90%
were totally covered with ice.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And for how long?

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Probably 5,000 years.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:51.270 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 5,000 years?

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:10%
>>FELIX: Yeah, it started--
that particular-- the major part

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:10%
of that ice age started
about 23,000 years ago.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it happened
today, 5,000 feet

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:84%
of ice, 5,000
years, the buildings

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.679 align:middle line:90%
would be covered in ice.

00:20:10.679 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Yes.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'd be
preserved in ice.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Yes.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When it thaws, what
happens to those buildings?

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:10%
Do they collapse?

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:10%
Do you dry them out
and use them again?

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.696 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: I don't think
they'll be there,

00:20:25.696 --> 00:20:27.220 align:middle line:90%
because ice is plastic.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So ice is always
moving downhill.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, they'll
rip it with that.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: It will--
moving slowly.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at a
glacier from the air,

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:84%
you usually see it has a
spine of darkness, right,

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.020 align:middle line:90%
up the center of it.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.365 align:middle line:84%
And that's because as it
moves down the valley,

00:20:45.365 --> 00:20:48.460 align:middle line:84%
it grinds rocks off of
both sides of the valley,

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and it flows like
water but very slowly.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So all of those rocks end
up sort of in the center

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and moving on down, but
it will wipe things out.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been to
the Athabasca Glacier

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.140 align:middle line:84%
in Canada, which is now--
it's has been receding.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the glaciers in
Alaska have been receding.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:90%
The Mendenhall Glacier--

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.273 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the
glaciers, by the way,

00:21:09.273 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:90%
remnants of past ice ages?

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, yes.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing,
as they recede,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:90%
you see ancient tree stumps.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.852 align:middle line:84%
Now, they've wiped out the
trees themselves, so buildings,

00:21:19.852 --> 00:21:21.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they would wipe out.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient
trunks are there.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, in today's world, I hear
a lot of people taking-- media

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.700 align:middle line:84%
is taking pictures of these
tree stumps that are showing up,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying that's
proof of global warming.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, no,
that's proof that it

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:84%
used to be warmer
than it is now.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.690 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to some
people this morning who

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
in the Denver area,

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:50.310 align:middle line:84%
they've uncovered mammoth bones
from before the last ice age,

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:84%
that as the-- and with points,
somehow, they have been killed.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm saying, yeah, there
were humans existing there,

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:90%
and mammoths.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:10%
So it had to have been warmer.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:10%
So when people talk to me
about this being unprecedented

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.470 align:middle line:10%
warming, no, no.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we going
to wake up one day

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and have a 10 foot
snowfall outside?

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.561 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Oh, I think various
parts of the world, yeah.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Because that-- what
essentially-- you had mentioned

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.455 align:middle line:84%
the 5,000 years of
the ice builds up.

00:22:21.455 --> 00:22:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, because it
takes 100 feet of snow

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:27.760 align:middle line:84%
to compress down
into one feet of ice,

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to be
looking at winter after winter

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.994 align:middle line:84%
after winter of 100 feet of
snow-- 10 stories of snow.

00:22:32.994 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh, Robert.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Just driving in the Midwest
with a dusting of snow

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle line:84%
or a little bit of ice
renders people useless.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:90%
You can't drive on ice.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.165 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
a quarter of an inch.

00:22:48.165 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Right.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, just this
last winter, Atlanta

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:90%
had those ice storms that--

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They take
down power lines.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.876 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Oh, they
take down power lines.

00:22:58.876 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I forget,
but I know that kids

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:84%
had to stay in their
schools overnight.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I mentioned in
my book, looking at an ice age,

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:84%
is that the climate of
Chicago will essentially

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.810 align:middle line:90%
move to Georgia.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.269 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, I'm seeing
these snowstorms in Georgia.

00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:19.893 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The devil
went down to Georgia

00:23:19.893 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So now, people survive
just fine in Chicago,

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:90%
so you can still survive this.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.214 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah, for a while, not
if it keeps building up though.

00:23:29.214 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:10%
>>FELIX: But again, it
only goes so far south.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:10%
This last year, when we
had the polar vortex,

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.480 align:middle line:10%
I looked at the maps
of that polar vortex,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:10%
and it was just incredible how
those maps curve down and it

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.274 align:middle line:10%
matches--

00:23:43.274 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The ice ages.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.100 align:middle line:10%
>>FELIX: --the ice age,
the extent of glaciation.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it just
shows, right there,

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.144 align:middle line:84%
where it's going tobe
covered or not covered.

00:23:51.144 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I wonder why.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, because
the jet stream does change

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:90%
during the ice age.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.770 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I had mentioned
that Seattle was covered.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:84%
It only went down
as far as Olympia.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's a convergence
zone, essentially,

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:84%
where you have snow
on the north side

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:90%
and warmer air in the south.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And that convergence zone
essentially moves south.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
south of that area,

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:84%
you'll be fine as long
as you can get food.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.926 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are ice ages
planet killers, just wipes

00:24:18.926 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:90%
out everything?

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: No, not wipes
out, no, because I

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
think that if we're
south of that area that's

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.340 align:middle line:84%
going to be covered,
we're going to be fine.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:84%
We just have to be prepared
for a few degrees colder.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to be coming up
with different kinds of food.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I had one old
geologist, Jack Sauers,

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:90%
who was raising akusti rye.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:84%
He was experimenting
with different kinds

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:84%
of foods that will grow
better in a cooler climate.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's one thing that I
would suggest that farmers

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:84%
be looking at, is at least
have the seeds ready,

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:84%
that they could plant
a different kind of--

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have witnessed,
just with a little snowfall,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:84%
that if a weather forecaster
goes on television

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and says we have
a blizzard coming,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:90%
the stores are ransacked.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:90%
They take everything.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:90%
They buy everything.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:90%
That's just with the one storm.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.940 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen
in terms of social unrest

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.310 align:middle line:90%
when this gets even worse?

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.399 align:middle line:90%
Predict this for us.

00:25:21.399 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, some of it
I hate to actually say.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.540 align:middle line:10%
But this H.H. Lamb I had talked
about one time, a climatologist

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.850 align:middle line:10%
out of the UK who wrote a
book about the Little Ice Age,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.390 align:middle line:10%
pointed out that
the crops failed.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.460 align:middle line:10%
What happened in--
United Kingdom

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.310 align:middle line:10%
did not get covered with ice.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:42.270 align:middle line:10%
But what happened is the rainy
season lasted five weeks longer

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:45.194 align:middle line:10%
in the spring, so people were
not able to plant their gardens

00:25:45.194 --> 00:25:46.485 align:middle line:10%
or they had to plant them late.

00:25:46.485 --> 00:25:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was too soggy.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: And then,
the rainy season

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.970 align:middle line:84%
came back five weeks
earlier in the fall,

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.910 align:middle line:90%
so their crops failed.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, literally, millions of
people died of starvation.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: It was a bad
time to go to jail.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, the
people who went to jail

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.460 align:middle line:84%
became food for the
other prisoners.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're kidding?

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Cannibalistic?

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Cannibalistic,
absolutely.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And H.H. Lamb talks
about the fact

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that-- and this is
horrible, but some people

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.590 align:middle line:90%
ate their own children.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [GASPS].

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:18.931 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: It was horrible.

00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:22.647 align:middle line:84%
So I don't like to talk
about that too much, but--

00:26:22.647 --> 00:26:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a reality, though.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, it is.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:90%
There's a--

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
hide from reality.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.744 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: There's
a book out there.

00:26:27.744 --> 00:26:28.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember the author.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.084 align:middle line:90%
It's "One Second After."

00:26:31.084 --> 00:26:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
William Forstchen.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.064 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: OK, and what
happens after an EMP--

00:26:35.064 --> 00:26:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Attack.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: OK.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or an X-flare.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: That book,
to me, tells me

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot about what would happen
after a magnetic reversal.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.426 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: That's scary.

00:26:46.426 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't really
like to talk that much.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'd like
people to be prepared.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you see, right now,

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.720 align:middle line:84%
is the biggest thing we
can do, as a society,

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.920 align:middle line:90%
to protect ourselves?

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.971 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything?

00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: I think the
biggest thing is just

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:90%
to tell us the truth.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, right now-- you
know, if you put me on a plane

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.130 align:middle line:84%
to Alaska, and you
told me in advance

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.780 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to Alaska,
I'd figure out what to do.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:90%
I'd pack the right things.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.739 align:middle line:84%
I'd pack the right
survival gear.

00:27:15.739 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.439 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For a short term.

00:27:17.439 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Yeah, but
people would, too.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're smart.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you tell me that
you're sending me to Florida

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and then you put me on a plane--
so I've prepared for Florida

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and you put me onto a plane
to Alaska, now I'm in trouble.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think
is happening today.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:84%
We're being told we're
going to Florida.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.152 align:middle line:84%
We're being told
it's global warming.

00:27:38.152 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I think we're headed
the other direction.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.300 align:middle line:84%
So just tell us the
truth, and I think

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:90%
that we can do a lot of things.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
you could be wrong?

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.871 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: I hope so.

00:27:48.871 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You want to be wrong?

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: I want to
be wrong, right.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.800 align:middle line:84%
But when I-- no,
I actually, no, I

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.460 align:middle line:84%
don't think-- I could be
wrong with the timing.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.410 align:middle line:84%
But when I look at what
has happened before

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and when I look at what
is happening today--

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.640 align:middle line:90%
and it's right there.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm not even a scientist.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You're a
former architect.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: I am quoting
scientists here.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I have a 28 page
bibliography in this book.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.350 align:middle line:90%
I've done my homework.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:18.627 align:middle line:84%
And as near as I can see, all
of those cycles are there.

00:28:18.627 --> 00:28:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I could be a little off on
timing, but that's about all.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.168 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do you
answer that argument, Robert,

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:25.170 align:middle line:84%
from people who say,
hey, Robert Felix,

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.690 align:middle line:84%
you're not a climatologist,
you're not a meteorologist,

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:90%
you're a former architect.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:32.556 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing,
talking about ice ages?

00:28:32.556 --> 00:28:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, I
think part of it

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is that I can look at it without
being-- my mind being colored

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.740 align:middle line:90%
by other things.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But what I have to
say is that I've

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.430 align:middle line:84%
had plenty of climatologists,
geologists, physicists,

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:84%
astrophysicists who have
endorsed the book, who

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.190 align:middle line:84%
have read it, and who
at least agree with me

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.720 align:middle line:90%
enough to have endorsed it.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'd
have to say, is

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.940 align:middle line:84%
that the people who have
published in this field

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.710 align:middle line:90%
do agree with it.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:04.918 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you first got
into this, when you first

00:29:04.918 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:84%
wrote "Not by Fire But by Ice"
back a long, long time ago,

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:90%
what scared you about this book?

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, the
shock to me, at first,

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.980 align:middle line:84%
was the magnetic
reversals, because when

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I was studying the
dinosaur extinction,

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:84%
magnetic reversals were
just mentioned in passing.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
in all honesty,

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard of
a magnetic reversal

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:90%
until I started studying this.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And then as I studied
more and more and more,

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and then I found out about the
underwater volcanoes-- again,

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:84%
underwater volcanoes
contribute to an ice age--

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's great science.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: I couldn't
find anybody.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I found-- and gee, I'm
not thinking of his name now.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:90%
But I finally found a scientist.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.920 align:middle line:84%
He was a South African
geologist who published in 1929,

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:84%
saying that underwater volcanoes
could cause an ice age.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, I didn't
find anybody outside of that.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think that'll
be my contribution.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one thing we know
for sure, Robert-- this planet

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:12.320 align:middle line:90%
is undergoing a major change.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: It is.

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.520 align:middle line:10%
And you know, this
little ice age

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.770 align:middle line:10%
cycle that I've talked
about, it correlates

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:10%
with the collapse
of the Roman Empire.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.850 align:middle line:10%
It correlates with the
collapse of the Grecian empire.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:27.030 align:middle line:10%
It correlates with the
collapse of the Sumerian.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:30.360 align:middle line:84%
It correlates with the time
when Genghis Khan swept out

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:30.960 align:middle line:90%
of the north.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we always
come back, don't we?

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.661 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: We always
come back, but I'm

00:30:33.661 --> 00:30:36.671 align:middle line:84%
afraid it could be correlating
with the end of a few empires

00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:37.170 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Thank you, George.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
called "Not by Fire

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:45.400 align:middle line:90%
But by Ice: The Coming Ice Age."

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.240 align:middle line:10%
Get yourself a coat, and get
ready for what's to come.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:56.270 align:middle line:90%
