00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.898 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:11.949 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:13.490 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.432 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:19.245 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.550 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory,
and my guest is

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.666 align:middle line:10%
a colleague of mine, Chris Geo.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:84%
He's a journalist, of course,
and also a noted researcher.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
He dives deep into
various topics.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Plus, he's also the
communications director

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.200 align:middle line:84%
for Mypatriotssupply.com
and he's

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.564 align:middle line:84%
the program director of
The Truth Frequency Radio.

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Chris, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS GEO: Thank you
for having me, George.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's good to have you.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So many things going on
in this planet right now.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
How do we keep up
with all this stuff?

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:10%
>>GEO: It is crazy, but
we have to have our finger

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.937 align:middle line:10%
on the pulse of
everything at every time,

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:10%
and we can take a look at
several different events

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:10%
and they seem unconnected,
but when you get down

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:10%
below the veil,
they're all connected.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people
call me on Coast to Coast

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:84%
and they say, how are
you always on, George.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:90%
You're always ready.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.962 align:middle line:84%
You always have the answers to
everything, and you have to.

00:01:16.962 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:84%
You have to study everything,
whether it's a situation here,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:84%
economically, civil unrest,
problems in the Middle East.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.751 align:middle line:84%
We got to be on top of that
as broadcasters, don't we?

00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Absolutely.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.041 align:middle line:10%
And we are cut from
a different cloth

00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:33.794 align:middle line:10%
because we really take
the brunt of everything.

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:10%
When you're down
there researching

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:10%
some of the most horrible
things that mankind

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.572 align:middle line:10%
is capable of doing, it takes
a special kind of person--

00:01:39.572 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They do.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Yes-- to be able to
separate yourself and take

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:84%
a look at all of this from
a third person perspective

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.569 align:middle line:84%
and say, I'm looking at this as
a journalist, not as a person,

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle line:84%
because if you look at
it as a person, then

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.690 align:middle line:90%
your heart starts to break.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:84%
My heart is broken
a million times

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.984 align:middle line:90%
over from looking at all this.

00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But, you know what?

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.066 align:middle line:84%
You have to desensitize
yourself from it, too.

00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
other gift or the art

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:90%
or maybe it's a curse.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.519 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I think it's a
little of everything.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:84%
It is a gift and it is
a curse at the same time

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes I keep
myself up at night just diving

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.100 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper and deeper
into realms of information

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
that the average person
just looks at the surface

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
and goes about their day,
but I think that we're really

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:84%
called here, George,
to do something

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:90%
special for this world.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.359 align:middle line:84%
We're really
called-- I don't know

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
if you've interviewed
Dolores Cannon.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I sure did, and she's
passed on now, isn't she?

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.510 align:middle line:10%
>>GEO: She has,
unfortunate, but I

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.009 align:middle line:10%
think we're some
of those souls that

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:10%
have come to help the
rest of these people here.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I interviewed
Dolores back in 1997

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:10%
to start when I was
doing my St. Louis Show,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.425 align:middle line:10%
and then we stayed friends
all the way through her death.

00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I was just with her at
her Ozark Martin event--

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Oh, fantastic.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --just in the summer.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:90%
So, sad to see her go.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Yes I interviewed
her, and she just

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.250 align:middle line:84%
had that grandmother
feeling to her.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Very down
to earth, wasn't she?

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cute little
giggle and stuff like that.

00:03:00.175 --> 00:03:00.675 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:03:00.675 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, as we look
at world events these days,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.827 align:middle line:84%
we have a nation in, I think,
turmoil, quite frankly,

00:03:08.827 --> 00:03:10.160 align:middle line:90%
with everything that's going on.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Uh huh.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you see as
some of the pressure points

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:90%
for a journalist these days?

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Right now, some of
the biggest things to look at

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:84%
is Iraq and ISIS,
because everything

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.946 align:middle line:84%
seems to be revolving
around Iraq.

00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what level
of information you look at--

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We keep
coming back to Iraq.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.201 align:middle line:10%
>>GEO: --we keep
coming back to Iraq.

00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.960 align:middle line:10%
Is it because of Babylonian
and Sumerian artifacts?

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it because of oil?

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Is a because of
economical situations

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.829 align:middle line:90%
or military strategical points?

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Your guess is as
good as mine, and it

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
depends on how deep the
listener in the audience

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.486 align:middle line:84%
really wants to go when
looking at this information,

00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
but I like to look at everything
from a 360-degree angle,

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.444 align:middle line:84%
and it really is all connected
and goes right back to Iraq.

00:03:53.444 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody watching
the show right now,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Chris, might say, come on.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Iraq?

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:84%
It's thousands and thousands of
miles away from where I live.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:90%
How does that affect me?

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.452 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: That's the
cradle of civilization.

00:04:06.452 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what people
need to realize,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.914 align:middle line:84%
that the first civilization,
Sumar, had a Congress.

00:04:11.914 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:90%
It had a Senate.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It had all of these different
things of modern society,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:84%
while the rest of the world
was painting on caves,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and they got their
information from somewhere

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and maybe this is a topic for
a completely different show,

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle line:84%
but we seem to be going back
to the exact same place.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.451 align:middle line:84%
Now the first operation that
they ran in Iraq in 2003,

00:04:32.451 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:84%
you'll never guess
what it's called.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's it called?

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.824 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Operation Planet X.

00:04:35.824 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Why would they call
it Operation Planet X?

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.331 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: On the surface, it
was to secure a village

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and arrest 264 Al Qaeda
members, as well as a leader.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
However, 11 miles away
was the Museum of Tikrit.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:84%
The Museum of Tikrit is famous
for the little serpentine

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:90%
statuettes--

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.173 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:56.173 --> 00:04:57.105 align:middle line:90%
The Baghdad Battery.

00:04:57.105 --> 00:04:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything like that.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes, exactly.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So maybe there's something
more than what's on the surface

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and why would they call
it Operation Planet X?

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.288 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we seem
to get involved, though,

00:05:06.288 --> 00:05:09.860 align:middle line:84%
in these countries, ousting
these dictators, who

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:84%
at one point they supported
us and we supported them,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:90%
and then they changed.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And in two cases, Gaddafi
in Libya and Saddam

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Hussein in Iraq.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Saddam was fine until he invaded
Kuwait after getting basically

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
our approval to
do that, and then

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:84%
the bottom fell out for the guy,
but I think his biggest mistake

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.740 align:middle line:84%
that he made was when he was
trying to convert dollars

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
for oil to euros, and that's
when we stepped in and said,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:90%
oh no no no.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Because in spite of his
whacked-out sons, who are dead,

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.160 align:middle line:84%
he kept at least his finger
on the pulse of Iraq.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:90%
The country functioned.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Uh huh.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
functioning now.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Absolutely.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And we see that every time we
go into one of these countries.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.759 align:middle line:84%
Afghanistan, for
instance, in the '70s.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
You see women walking
around in mini-skirts

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.650 align:middle line:84%
and going to university,
and we installed

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.894 align:middle line:84%
these radical
governments and then

00:06:06.894 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:84%
we point the finger
and say, look,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:90%
they're under Shariah Law.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Look what they're
doing to their women.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:90%
What about Saudi Arabia?

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.864 align:middle line:84%
Saudi Arabia is one of
the biggest guilty--

00:06:14.864 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They still
behead people.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
For being homosexual or for
being a woman who's been raped

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:90%
or anything under Shariah Law.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.946 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take a loaf of
bread from a Saudi bakery.

00:06:26.946 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:90%
They'll chop off your hand.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're not pointing
the finger at them.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Because we get
our oil from them.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.872 align:middle line:90%
They're our friends.

00:06:32.872 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:84%
However, we'll radicalize
all these other governments

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.332 align:middle line:84%
and install the Taliban,
for instance, and then point

00:06:37.332 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:84%
the finger and say, look
how barbaric they are.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're working for us.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did we not create ISIS,
these butchers who are truly

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:84%
out there doing horrendous
things to people, beheading

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:56.440 align:middle line:84%
people, raping and pillaging
women, shooting to death

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.390 align:middle line:84%
other soldiers from
different areas.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:90%
But didn't we create them?

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Didn't we arm them?

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: There seems to be two
generations going on here.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.665 align:middle line:84%
The first generation,
of course, is Al Qaeda.

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
The second generation
is ISIS, and in ISIS, we

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:84%
armed them while
they were fighting

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.452 align:middle line:84%
in Syria as the
Free Syrian Army.

00:07:14.452 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To get rid of Assad.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.758 align:middle line:84%
We drop all these weapons on
them, and then all of a sudden

00:07:18.758 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:84%
they turn their weapons on
us and now they're the enemy,

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and now we have to
go and get ISIS.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, we as
independent journalists

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:84%
were exposing what was happening
with the Free Syrian Army

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.741 align:middle line:84%
while we were supposedly
allies with them,

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:31.823 align:middle line:84%
and that was they were
eating people's hearts out.

00:07:31.823 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:84%
We have videos of them literally
eating people's hearts--

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.883 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:34.883 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: --so it does show
a level of barbarism

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.216 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with and
that we're ultimately funding,

00:07:39.216 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:84%
but when we go all the way
back to the '70s, to Al Qaeda,

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.937 align:middle line:84%
we ultimately, as most people
know, created Al Qaeda.

00:07:45.937 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes we did.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Al Qaeda
means the database--

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were the
Mujahideen of Afghanistan.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.310 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to provoke
Russia into a war

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that they could
not sustain, so we

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:84%
backed Afghanistan and
the Taliban in doing so.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.280 align:middle line:90%
Our hero was Osama bin Laden.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
He was a CIA card-carrying
member, and he was our hero.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.002 align:middle line:90%
His name was Tim Osman.

00:08:07.002 --> 00:08:08.210 align:middle line:90%
You can see newspapers here--

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tim Osman went to
Sherman Oaks California,

00:08:10.335 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:84%
not far from my broadcast
studio, touring the area.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.200 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So then all of a sudden
they attack us in 1993

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.520 align:middle line:84%
at the World Trade
Center bombing

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and then they attack
us in 2001 supposedly.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.336 align:middle line:84%
And then in Libya,
they're our friends

00:08:25.336 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're taking
down Gaddafi for us.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.335 align:middle line:84%
And in Syria,
they're our friends

00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and now they're
our enemies again,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.120 align:middle line:84%
so it really makes
absolutely no sense

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.740 align:middle line:84%
unless you start to realize that
the Western governments have

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
been creating these
problem-reaction solutions

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.100 align:middle line:84%
in order to maintain wars in
order to take over regions,

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle line:84%
the same way that
we created Saddam.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
that's the bottom line?

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Absolutely.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.921 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
I've always wondered

00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
why do these groups that we
help turn on us so much and so

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:90%
quickly?

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: It's because we've
created them to do so.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.700 align:middle line:84%
We create them out of a
need for war or a pretext

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:84%
to do something that-- maybe
take resources, maybe go

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.015 align:middle line:84%
into Iraq and take
all the artifacts.

00:09:03.015 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, Saddam, he was going
to put all those artifacts out

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:84%
on display for the
entire world to look at,

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.061 align:middle line:90%
and, once we took them over--

00:09:10.061 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what Zecharia Sitchin
has was a small, small portion

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:90%
of what actually exists.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.949 align:middle line:84%
What is it that they're trying
to hide in that situation?

00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
He was saying that
he had a stargate.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
He was saying he was
the reincarnation

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.900 align:middle line:90%
of Nebuchadnezzar.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Now, was he a crazy
dictator or was he really onto

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:84%
something, and is there
some information--

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or both.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: --in those artifacts.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.156 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this conversation can go
so many different ways, George,

00:09:31.156 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's just
absolutely fascinating,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's great to
have your finger

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:84%
right on the pulse
of all of this.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, as a person
who is seeking the truth,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:43.070 align:middle line:84%
like you, how do you even begin
to start something like this,

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and what direction
do you go down?

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: The first thing that
I do is I use my intuition

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.192 align:middle line:84%
and I follow my heart,
whatever feels right to me,

00:09:50.192 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll start
going down that road.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let that
gut work for you.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yeah.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And if I run into stumbling
blocks, then I'll go back

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:90%
and I'll change my analysis.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:84%
See, as a radio broadcaster,
I've had listeners write me

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, on December
10, 2010, you said this

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.166 align:middle line:84%
and today you're saying
something completely contrary.

00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
That's because
I'm doing research

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not afraid
to change my mind,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and people have to realize
that, that if they're

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:84%
changing their minds, it's
because new information is

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.990 align:middle line:84%
coming in and they're
doing research.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it's all about.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.388 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Biggest tinderbox
right now in this country,

00:10:18.388 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:90%
in this world, where?

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:90%
The Middle East?

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Absolutely.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything revolves
around the Middle East.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.700 align:middle line:84%
ISIS is the Islamic
state of Iraq and Syria.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.870 align:middle line:84%
That changed to the Islamic
state of Iraq and the Levant.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.475 align:middle line:84%
The Levant is Cyprus,
Turkey, Jordan, Palestine.

00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Now all of a sudden
we have this group

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.900 align:middle line:90%
encompassing this entire region.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.417 align:middle line:84%
So now we see the focus is
much broader than just Iraq,

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
but, ultimately, we're talking
about the Persian Empire.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.580 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about Babylon;
we're talking about Sumar.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it really
comes down to the question

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:90%
of why is all this happening.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.805 align:middle line:84%
I can speculate as
to where exactly this

00:10:54.805 --> 00:10:56.430 align:middle line:84%
is going, what
direction this is going.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that, if you look at
the-- if you look at the map--

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.815 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you this for
sure-- you look at the map

00:11:00.815 --> 00:11:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and you see it's
like a chess board.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're setting up our
pieces all around Iran.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Iran is the final target.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
We've been wanting to
go in there for a decade

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:84%
now, if not longer, and so now
that we have our pieces set up,

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:84%
if we make a move towards
Iran-- and we might not even

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:84%
have to-- but, ultimately,
to provoke Russia and China.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: In 2007, I was talking
about how there is a plan

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:84%
to provoke Russia and China into
a war that they cannot sustain.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:90%
How do I know this?

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm an oracle and I
get messages from the sky.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:84%
It's because I read
their documents.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Zbigniew Brzezinski writes
about how he goes in there

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and provokes these countries
into wars that they cannot

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.300 align:middle line:84%
sustain, thus bringing
down the Soviet Union.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to bring
down Russia and China,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what we're doing.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We keep doing that.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yeah.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So we poke the bear a
little bit too much,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:84%
the bear is going to attack
exactly the way we want him to,

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and we already see Russia and
Putin flexing their muscles,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
flying planes over
to our coastlines--

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.891 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: So there is something
absolutely going on,

00:11:57.891 --> 00:11:59.516 align:middle line:84%
and Putin is not
somebody to mess with.

00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:00.682 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was going to say.

00:12:00.682 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Can't this backfire?

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
It can, but the reason
we haven't gone into Iran

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:84%
is because Zbigniew
Brzezinski, himself, said,

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
we can't predict
what's going to happen,

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:84%
so they've been playing
their cards very, very--

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they'll
let Israel do it.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.752 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Possibly.

00:12:16.752 --> 00:12:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
Israel's involvement is

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:84%
in this whole
situation, but they

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.932 align:middle line:84%
seem to be tied
into MI6 and CIA,

00:12:22.932 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and the Western governments
seem to be working all together

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.915 align:middle line:84%
in unison, so I would
say that they ultimately

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle line:90%
have the same agenda.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, they've been
talking about and concerned

00:12:31.165 --> 00:12:34.650 align:middle line:84%
about for years
Iran's nuclear program

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's getting closer
and closer and closer,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and if Iran is, indeed,
working on nukes,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:90%
they got to be almost there.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I think Iran has
a right to have nukes.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:90%
Why would they not?

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:90%
They're a large country.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:90%
They're a westernized country.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a, you know, they're-- Iran
hasn't invaded anybody in 200

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.750 align:middle line:84%
The United States invades
somebody every 20 to 30 years,

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:90%
so we're really the bad guys.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:90%
We're really the terrorists.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think Iraq
attacked them first.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that correct?

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:02.669 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:13:02.669 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.224 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at it,
it's the same situation

00:13:06.224 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:84%
we have here in
the United States.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:90%
They want to take our guns.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.961 align:middle line:84%
They want to take our guns,
while all the while they're

00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:13.174 align:middle line:84%
the ones who are being the
aggressors with the guns,

00:13:13.174 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:84%
so that's ultimately
what we're doing to Iran.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:84%
We're saying, no, you can't
have a nuclear weapon.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Iran just wants to
defend themselves or be

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.193 align:middle line:84%
able to defend
themselves in the event

00:13:20.193 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:84%
that a nuclear weapon is used
on them, which I don't even

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
think it's going
to come down to,

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:84%
because right now we're at a
point of mutual destruction.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.510 align:middle line:84%
If somebody launches
a nuke, everybody--

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody else launches.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.936 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard of
the Samson Option?

00:13:30.936 --> 00:13:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But-- Yes, I have.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: OK.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that is in Israel.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.741 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That they will
launch everything--

00:13:39.741 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --if hit.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Absolutely.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is a scary
mentality to have.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:45.545 align:middle line:90%
A country that's saying--

00:13:45.545 --> 00:13:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --if we're going down--

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: If we're going down--

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you're
all going down.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.283 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: --the whole
world's going down,

00:13:49.283 --> 00:13:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.505 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same mentality
when we fired up Cern.

00:13:53.505 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:84%
They thought that
they were going

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.044 align:middle line:84%
to blow up the atmosphere,
and they said, oh, we'll

00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
just do it anyways
and see what happens.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.293 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:59.293 --> 00:14:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: If the world
ends, so be it.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.716 align:middle line:84%
This is the type of
mentality that we're

00:14:02.716 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:90%
dealing with here, George.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:84%
As a journalist, I
just sit back and I

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:84%
cringe, because how can you
have this type of mentality?

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you hear
conspiratorial stories,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.720 align:middle line:84%
do you scoff at them or
do you say, you know,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.429 align:middle line:84%
there could be
some truth to this?

00:14:18.429 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I find that the truth
always lies in the middle,

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.152 align:middle line:84%
and so when somebody's
in one direction

00:14:23.152 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
or in another
direction, I say, you

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:84%
know what, let's look
right in the middle.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the moon
landing, for instance.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are pointing at
that and saying, it's a fake.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.020 align:middle line:90%
It's all fake.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We were there.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.530 align:middle line:90%
I know we were there.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: And other people
are saying we were there.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:90%
I know we were there.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.321 align:middle line:84%
What if the truth
lies in the middle?

00:14:36.321 --> 00:14:39.090 align:middle line:84%
What if we did go, but
the pictures are fake.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Made in a studio.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.234 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:14:41.234 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they got mixed
in with the real ones.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I always
find to be the case.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:84%
With the ISIS situation,
are they a threat?

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:84%
To a point, because you have
an ideology of radical Islam,

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and it can hook in a small
percentage of these people

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.642 align:middle line:84%
and so, naturally, you're going
to have some people that go out

00:15:01.642 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and think that they're
doing something for God,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:84%
but the majority of these people
we call Islamic extremists

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.130 align:middle line:84%
are really just
freedom fighters.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.006 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: They're fighting
for their homes.

00:15:11.006 --> 00:15:13.202 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if anybody invaded
the United States--

00:15:13.202 --> 00:15:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Russia, or China,
or anybody else--

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I would expect every
American out there

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
to stand up and
fight along with me,

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and they would call
me a rebel and they

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:90%
would call me a terrorist.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The horror
that we see, though.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:84%
The video horror of
them beheading people,

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
soldiers that have
been captured,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Americans that are there,
aid workers, journalists--

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:84%
assuming those videos
are real-- barbaric--

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --totally
barbaric and uncalled for.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes, absolutely.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, during the UK
beheading, George,

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I looked at these
beheading videos coming out

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
from these cartels
and the impact

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
that it left upon my soul
is something that I hope

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.090 align:middle line:84%
that nobody has to go
through, but as a journalist,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I had to look at these because
I had to understand exactly

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:84%
how real beheadings
look, how they sound,

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.790 align:middle line:84%
every single detail,
how much strength it

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:90%
takes to dislocate the neck--

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you die
instantly or what?

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: --everything.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the
people die instantly,

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:84%
yes, but I'm actually
pretty amazed at how

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:84%
some of these people are
able to slice the heads off,

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.787 align:middle line:84%
and these kids look like they
were about 15, 16 years old,

00:16:18.787 --> 00:16:20.911 align:middle line:84%
and then I did a little
more research and found out

00:16:20.911 --> 00:16:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that they were
arresting assassins down

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:84%
on the south border who
are 15, 16 years old,

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and they were paid $2000 to
go cut somebody's head off.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they did.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: So these are the cartels
that we're talking about--

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:31.095 --> 00:16:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: --but I looked
at these videos

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to examine,
what does a real beheading

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:90%
video look like.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the James Foley
videos and these other ISIS

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.590 align:middle line:84%
videos, I can't
say that they look

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.492 align:middle line:90%
the same as genuine videos.

00:16:43.492 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:84%
James Foley, himself, is a
very interesting character

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.660 align:middle line:84%
because he was supposedly
kidnapped in Libya, released.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.790 align:middle line:84%
He was paraded around on the
BBC, re-kidnapped in Syria,

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:55.590 align:middle line:90%
and then beheaded.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bad luck for him.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Yes, but does lightning
strike twice in the same place

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.189 align:middle line:90%
or are they using crisis actors?

00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, do you
think he was beheaded

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.040 align:middle line:90%
or he's alive somewhere?

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.339 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I think
that he died before

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and they just used maybe an
actor or maybe even a dummy

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.647 align:middle line:84%
when they show the
actual beheading.

00:17:14.647 --> 00:17:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I can't say for
certain what happened.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.099 align:middle line:84%
I can only speculate
on that, but I

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:84%
do know that there's a lot of
inconsistencies in the video,

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:90%
in the way the video was cut.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in this production
of these beheading videos--

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me back up
for just a moment.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.280 align:middle line:84%
The beheading videos that
I've seen that are genuine

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
are usually done with a
cellphone, a single camera,

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:32.920 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:84%
This James Foley video
was a whole production

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:84%
with lighting and
everything else,

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and you see two different
camera angles, and it's absurd.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:90%
It looks like it's--

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Staged.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: --on a studio.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.715 align:middle line:84%
And there was actually a
company out of the UK--

00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember their name
off the top of my head,

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:84%
but they came out and did a
forensic analysis on the video

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and said this is most
likely fake, so I'm not

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.060 align:middle line:84%
the only one screaming
that this is fake.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even screaming
that it's fake.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.186 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I
notice and I'm moving on

00:17:57.186 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:84%
with the situation, but looking
at the other five beheadings,

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.852 align:middle line:84%
you lie to me once and show
me a fake video one time,

00:18:02.852 --> 00:18:04.935 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to believe
the third, fourth, fifth,

00:18:04.935 --> 00:18:06.240 align:middle line:90%
or sixth video.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So why don't
we round up these people

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
or find out where they're
training and use tactical nukes

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.611 align:middle line:90%
and just obliterate them?

00:18:15.611 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: That's a very
interesting question,

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and I'm chuckling a little bit
because the answer is so funny

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:84%
because Baghdadi, the
previous Baghdadi-- we have

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.950 align:middle line:84%
two Baghdadis who are
the leader of ISIS.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.641 align:middle line:84%
The previous one was actually
trained in a US military base.

00:18:30.641 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: So when you say,
why don't we bomb them,

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:84%
we're essentially talking
about bombing ourselves.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But don't
you think that would

00:18:38.015 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:90%
put a stop to everything?

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes and no.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because we would threaten
anybody who's actually

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.499 align:middle line:84%
fighting for a cause other
than protecting their homes.

00:18:49.499 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:84%
However, the majority
of these people

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.457 align:middle line:84%
in Iraq, Afghanistan, these
are regular people like you

00:18:53.457 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and I, who are fighting
for their homes, who

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:84%
we call Islamic
extremists and terrorists.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.869 align:middle line:84%
When you're fighting
for your home, George,

00:18:59.869 --> 00:19:00.910 align:middle line:90%
that's what you're doing.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, the problem is--

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.859 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: That's why we haven't
been able to win in Iraq.

00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The problem in Iraq is
once we took over and instilled

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
a different administration,
they threw out

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
all of Saddam Hussein's people:
doctors, soldiers, teachers.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.360 align:middle line:90%
They were all gone.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:90%
They were all out of jobs.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Their careers were over.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Rather than try to
work with them and say,

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:84%
hey, Saddam's out,
but you know what?

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:90%
It had nothing to do with you.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:84%
We still want you here in
our colleges, in our schools,

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:90%
in our hospitals.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have
had this problem.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:84%
ISIS was also created
by those people

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.019 align:middle line:84%
that were displaced
and kicked out.

00:19:42.019 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Right.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.976 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're coming back
because they want their jobs.

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:90%
They want their homes.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.580 align:middle line:90%
They want a life back.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the people in
Iraq, when they came in,

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.454 align:middle line:90%
destroyed that for them.

00:19:54.454 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I think
what the answer is,

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:84%
is that the Western
governments need

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.189 align:middle line:84%
to take a step back and
mind their own business.

00:19:59.189 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Ron Paul talked about blowback.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Originally.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.490 align:middle line:84%
We should never have been
in Iraq in the first place--

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --you know.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Saddam wasn't doing
anything to us.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:84%
He was playing ball, but as
soon as he went into Kuwait

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and, basically, we turned
our face a little bit when

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.099 align:middle line:90%
he talked about this--

00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Well, Kuwait was
doing horizontal drilling

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:90%
and taking his oil.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.678 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We specifically
told him when he said,

00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I have to stop this, we said,
we're not getting involved.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.860 align:middle line:84%
This is an Arab
to Arab situation,

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.595 align:middle line:84%
and so he basically
said, oh, OK,

00:20:30.595 --> 00:20:33.679 align:middle line:84%
and in he went and then the
bottom fell out for him.

00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Right.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
But we did install
Saddam, and there's

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.320 align:middle line:84%
a picture of Donald Rumsfeld
shaking hands with him--

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We gave him
chemical weapons.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: --after the
chemical weapons sale.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're right on
line with that.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So, again, it goes right back to
creating all of these dictators

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.981 align:middle line:84%
and then pointing
them out as a bad guy.

00:20:51.981 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gaddafi--

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Gaddafi.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --was not a saint, but
changed when Reagan bombed them

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and, unfortunately, killed
one of his wives and children,

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Gaddafi changed.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he said, enough
is enough, turned in his nukes,

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:84%
got rid of them, and at least
started playing ball again.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Yes, was involved in the
bombing of one of the airliners,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:90%
but he straightened out.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:90%
He had Libya under control.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:84%
He shared the oil
money with the Libyans.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:90%
He took care of hospitalization.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:90%
He took care of schools.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Call him what you may,
Libya was somewhat

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
calm under his leadership after
he stopped being the terrorist

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:84%
that he once was, and once
he came out of office,

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:90%
the bottom fell out there, too.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Look what happened, Benghazi
and everything else.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Well, I have to disagree
with some of those points

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:55.270 align:middle line:84%
because my mother grew up in
Libya and my grandfather moved

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:84%
from Cyprus to Libya to
work in the oil industry,

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.582 align:middle line:84%
and Libya was pretty much
a thriving country and--

00:22:02.582 --> 00:22:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Under Gaddafi?

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Under Gaddafi.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.575 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: I never heard about any--

00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I meant.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Stories of-- Oh,
OK. --about any stories

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.524 align:middle line:84%
of tyranny or anything like
that, and the whole Lockerbie

00:22:10.524 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:84%
situation, where he supposedly
bombed the airliners,

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.980 align:middle line:84%
it turned out that it
wasn't even him that did it.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
But Gaddafi, when
he took over, he

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:84%
lived in a tent with his
mother until every man, woman,

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:90%
and child in Libya had a house.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.300 align:middle line:90%
In Libya, housing was a right.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.840 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
that you buy.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.810 align:middle line:84%
You could buy an upgraded
house, but housing

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:31.893 align:middle line:90%
was a right for everybody.

00:22:31.893 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Electricity was free.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.405 align:middle line:90%
Gas was $0.17 a gallon.

00:22:35.405 --> 00:22:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Health care was free.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.571 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not that way now.

00:22:37.571 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: No, absolutely not.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Most of the population
was upper middle class.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Everybody got a percentage of
the oil revenue and the profits

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.227 align:middle line:90%
every single month.

00:22:45.227 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that
they're mostly afraid of,

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion-- well, there's
two things, the Islamic banking

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.269 align:middle line:84%
system and the
gold, which I want

00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:90%
to talk about here in a moment.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.186 align:middle line:90%
But the Islamic banking system.

00:22:55.186 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you want
to start a business.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.216 align:middle line:84%
You go to the bank and say,
I'd like to start a business,

00:22:59.216 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and they give you a
loan, no interest--

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No interest.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: --with a small--

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.493 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's against their law.

00:23:03.493 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Then, your job is to help
another business succeed.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So they have an
economy that is based

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:84%
on helping small businesses
thrive instead of eliminating

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.216 align:middle line:84%
small businesses through
interest and through debt,

00:23:15.216 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
like we have here in
the United States.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.256 align:middle line:84%
So they're deathly
afraid of that,

00:23:18.256 --> 00:23:20.550 align:middle line:84%
but Gaddafi had
tons of gold, which

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:84%
he was going to actually take
and turn into the gold dinar

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:90%
and also trade as oil and gold.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.582 align:middle line:84%
He wanted only gold, which is
the same mistake Saddam made.

00:23:29.582 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.664 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: But he
wanted to circulate

00:23:31.664 --> 00:23:33.337 align:middle line:84%
this gold around
the African Union

00:23:33.337 --> 00:23:34.670 align:middle line:90%
to strengthen the African Union.

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've found Council of
Foreign Relation documents

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:84%
from the '40s that
were stating, we

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.136 align:middle line:84%
could never allow the
African Union to unite,

00:23:41.136 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:84%
because, if they do, they
will take over the world,

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly
what Gaddafi was doing,

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.660 align:middle line:84%
was trying to unite
the African Union.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And now he's gone.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And Libya is bombed
back to the Stone Age.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.748 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the people
who attacked him,

00:23:52.748 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:84%
aren't they part
of the ISIS group?

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:90%
They're Al Qaeda.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Gaddafi was saying while this
whole uprising was happening,

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:90%
it's Al Qaeda that's doing this.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:84%
It's Al Qaeda that's doing
this, and nobody was listening,

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and so we were saying that
there were all these protests

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and uprisings and violence
going on in Libya,

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:84%
while Russia Today had
their cameras there

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.950 align:middle line:84%
showing in Tripoli the
bombings weren't actually

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:15.940 align:middle line:90%
even happening.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Russia Today had their cameras
posted on one building,

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and they were filming the
Western journalists rallying

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
the protesters up
and making them chant

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and creating a scene as
if something was actually

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:84%
happening, and the whole
situation was staged.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing that came across
my view and the first red flag

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.960 align:middle line:84%
was the story that
Reuters carried,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and it showed this picture of
a bunch of mugshots or driver's

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.700 align:middle line:84%
license photos and a
date that said 1996,

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and it was a huge,
beautifully printed up banner,

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and the caption
read, "Protesters

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.507 align:middle line:84%
are honoring the
fallen in the uprising

00:24:52.507 --> 00:24:54.090 align:middle line:84%
against Gaddafi in
the last few days."

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that
went through my mind

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:84%
is, how did they get these
photos of all of these people

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:84%
who had fallen in
the last few days,

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and if there's upheaval and
uprising going on in Libya, how

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%
are they able to print
this beautiful banner?

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.410 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out,
the date 1996 was

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.377 align:middle line:84%
because it was a
prison massacre that

00:25:10.377 --> 00:25:11.960 align:middle line:84%
took place because
of some corruption,

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and every year at
that time, the people

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.790 align:middle line:84%
would get together and
do a memorial service

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.390 align:middle line:84%
for all of the people who were
killed in the prison massacre.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were killed there.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Now, this was
a series of photos.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.100 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just one
photo, so we can't say,

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.570 align:middle line:90%
oh Reuters made a mistake here.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: It was
something intentional,

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and then we started doing
more and more investigation,

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and the last thing
Gaddafi actually did,

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.800 align:middle line:84%
because he was busy building
his country and giving all

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.360 align:middle line:84%
the profit of the oil
revenue to his people,

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.766 align:middle line:84%
he gave everybody
AK47s and he said,

00:25:38.766 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:90%
you have to fight because--

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
the mistake he made.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Well, no, no, no.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.865 align:middle line:84%
He gave everybody AK47s to fight
whatever intruders or invaders

00:25:45.865 --> 00:25:46.740 align:middle line:90%
there were, because--

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.323 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but
they turned on him.

00:25:48.323 --> 00:25:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Supposedly.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.000 align:middle line:84%
That's according to the official
story, but what really happened

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
is that the Western governments
hired 50,000 mercenaries

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:84%
to go into Libya
to quote/unquote

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.210 align:middle line:90%
quell the protesters.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Those mercenaries were
Al Qaeda members and also

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.717 align:middle line:84%
African mercenaries as
well, who went in there

00:26:05.717 --> 00:26:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and were causing all
of this violence.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.674 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
wanted Gaddafi out.

00:26:08.674 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:84%
They wanted Gaddafi
out, but it wasn't

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:90%
the people living in Libya.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It was the Western governments
who were going in there

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and creating this
whole staged war.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the next point
is they want Putin out.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So we have a whole
nother situation there

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.175 align:middle line:90%
with the Ukrainian airliner.

00:26:24.175 --> 00:26:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's a
little more dangerous.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: He's extremely
more dangerous,

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.360 align:middle line:90%
and he is not a George W. Bush.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:84%
He's not a bumbling president,
as we've seen in the past.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.986 align:middle line:90%
He was former head of the KGB.

00:26:38.986 --> 00:26:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't trust him.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: No.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.310 align:middle line:84%
No, but this man
knows what he's doing,

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and he's not going
to allow any of this.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean the BRICS
alliance in itself

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:84%
has created a situation
to where Russia and China

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and a few other
countries are free

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.070 align:middle line:84%
from the economic oppression
of the Western banking systems.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So now that they've
already created

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:59.140 align:middle line:84%
their own little banking system
and their own little cartel,

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.640 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better
term, there really

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.749 align:middle line:84%
is a division in the world
that is ripe for World War III.

00:27:06.749 --> 00:27:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
You can just feel it,
and it's unfortunate.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
The next president who comes
in after the 2016 election

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.770 align:middle line:84%
is going to have his
or her hands full.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: And here we are
again with another choice

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.582 align:middle line:84%
between Jeb Bush
and Hillary Clinton.

00:27:22.582 --> 00:27:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It appears
to be that way.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So we had Reagan in the
'80s, who behind him

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:32.910 align:middle line:84%
was George Bush, Sr., and
once Reagan was injured--

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.080 align:middle line:84%
it was an attempted
assassination on Reagan-- Bush

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.940 align:middle line:84%
pretty much took over, and
then after that, we had Bush,

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and then after that,
we had Clinton,

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and then after that, we had
Bush for two terms, his son,

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and then we had Obama,
who, as it turns out,

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.660 align:middle line:84%
is linked up with
this whole family,

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and now we have a choice of
Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.170 align:middle line:84%
If this isn't an
oligarchy, I don't what is.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
happened to Ron Paul

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and do you think
Rand Paul will run?

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Rand Paul
might, but I don't

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.405 align:middle line:84%
think that Rand Paul has
the views that Ron Paul did.

00:28:07.405 --> 00:28:09.405 align:middle line:84%
I had the chance of meeting
Ron Paul personally.

00:28:09.405 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was a good guy.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: He was a very good guy.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was on my
show a couple times.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.438 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: You can tell he's
a very genuine person,

00:28:14.438 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:84%
but, unfortunately, nobody
wants to listen to the truth.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he won
most of the debates

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.250 align:middle line:90%
that they included him in.

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:84%
When you did your internet
polling afterwards,

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:90%
he was always way up there.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And then the mainstream
media gets on the interviews

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and says, oh, well, it must
be just internet forums that

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.690 align:middle line:90%
are manipulating the numbers.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.170 align:middle line:84%
People don't really
want Ron Paul.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not those who vote
that make the decisions.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.400 align:middle line:84%
It's those who count the
votes that make the decisions.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Stalin said that.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me ask you
some quick questions.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.764 align:middle line:84%
Social networking, helping
or hurting society?

00:28:51.764 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:10%
>>GEO: I think it's doing
a little bit of both

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:10%
because the CIA
couldn't have asked

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:10%
for a better database
than Facebook.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:10%
Everybody volunteers where
they're at, what they're doing,

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:10%
friends, all of that.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.650 align:middle line:10%
But then again,
at the same time,

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:10%
we have an ability to network
and get a message out there

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.940 align:middle line:10%
and share information, so it's
really a double-edged sword.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not the
technology that's bad.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.797 align:middle line:90%
It's what you do with it.

00:29:16.797 --> 00:29:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, if people
want to track you and find out

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.500 align:middle line:84%
what you do, where you
are, how do they find you?

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Truefrequencyradio..com.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes sir.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.576 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Thank you, sir.

00:29:26.576 --> 00:29:29.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Amazing interview
with an amazing journalist,

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.700 align:middle line:10%
who simply wants the truth.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.350 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
