00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.100 align:middle line:10%
Laurie McDonald is with us,
the former president of OPUS,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:10%
she'll explain what that is,
and a clinical hypnotherapist.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
She's also an ET
abduction researcher

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and an international
public speaker

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:84%
on the topics of consciousness
and spirituality.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.025 align:middle line:90%
Laurie, welcome to the program.

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, George.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Explain what OPUS is.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:10%
>> OPUS is the Organization
for Paranormal Understanding

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:10%
and Support.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:10%
They offer a free
24-hour online support

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.430 align:middle line:10%
group for people who
have had experiences

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:10%
and need some help now.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:84%
They also do
analyses on anything

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
related to the topic
that might require a lab.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>> So tell us more about you.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I'm a clinical
hypnotherapist.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.720 align:middle line:10%
And during school,
at one of my exams,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:10%
we have to regress
somebody in front

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:10%
of a panel of four judges.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually looking
for some suppressed creative

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.490 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:84%
But he spontaneously
regressed to a younger child,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
where he and his
brother on a camp trip

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:84%
were viewing a UFO that landed,
and that beings exited the UFO.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:84%
When I was about to
ask him a question,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
a softball size of
light appeared right

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.500 align:middle line:84%
at his forehead,
skimmed down his body--

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Like an orb?

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Like an orb.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:84%
A little heavier,
more dense than an orb

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:90%
because it wasn't see-through.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Then I'm a little bit shocked.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.030 align:middle line:90%
This has never happened.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I turned to look at the judges
who indicate for me to continue

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.640 align:middle line:90%
as I do have a subject under.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:90%
I asked him the next question.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:90%
He was blank.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Had no idea of what
he had just said.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I got a reputation back
then in the early '90s

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:90%
for working with experiences.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:84%
That one event really
snowballed into what I do today.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:90%
You went to Southeast Asia.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>> What was that trip for?

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> That was because I'd worked
with a number of Vietnam

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
veterans who had
experienced face to face,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:84%
eye to eye contact with
non-humans who battled UFOs,

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:84%
who had seen portals open,
and were silenced for decades.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I regressed them, learned
additional information,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and booked a trip to
the DMZ near a village

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.810 align:middle line:84%
called Cam Lo in Vietnam and
went to check it out myself.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It has changed
a lot, hasn't it?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It has changed a lot, but
they're still the same stories,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
although the people are
reluctant to speak about it

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:84%
until they're more
comfortable with you.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But there were many
stories about babies being

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:90%
born that looked different.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
clearly differentiate

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:84%
between being half
American and half

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Asian different or
extraterrestrial

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:90%
and human different.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And the ladies say that
they were sent away

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:84%
with their babies to
monasteries and never came back

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:90%
with the babies.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember stories of our
soldiers in Vietnam talking

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:84%
about an enormous
amount of UFO presence--

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It was huge.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>> --when were there.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:84%
General Brown reported the Viet
Cong and many of the US Marines

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:84%
joined together on several
nights and battled UFOs,

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:84%
where they thought that a
portal was opened in UFO

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:84%
were flying out of
a portal as opposed

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.850 align:middle line:84%
to coming out of the
ground or the sky

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and the portal energy was highly
magnetic and extremely static

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.090 align:middle line:84%
to the people who
were very close to it.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they saw more than just
UFOs come out of that portal.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:90%
They said that they--

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:84%
the Marines that I
worked with described

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
beings that were more
animal than human and large.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Very large.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Almost second
dimensional entities.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
The portal that was
opened accidentally

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:90%
is what they gathered.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>> And they came flying out?

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And they came flying out,
as if something happened.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps it was the war.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Electrical spiking in the area.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I was gonna say.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:90%
What opens or closes a portal?

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Frequency.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Energetic frequency.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Accidental?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It can happen.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>> All you have to do
is resonate or create

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:90%
the appropriate harmonics.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> What would happen, Laurie,
if you were walking through

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:90%
a portal, and it closes on you?

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:90%
How do you get back?

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>> You might not come back.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:90%
You may not always come back.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Now I do recall that
there were portals

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:84%
opened years ago in Peru that
people were coming and going

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.380 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>> At will.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe it was the Celestine
Prophecies that spoke about

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.880 align:middle line:84%
But there are portals
or energetic areas

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth, even black holes,
that people can disappear in.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you heard
of David Paulides?

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I have.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:84%
David does investigating people
who disappear off this planet.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
explanation where they go.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Parents may be walking
with a child who's

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.330 align:middle line:84%
two feet behind them,
singing and dancing.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:90%
The singing and dancing stops.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
They turn around, and
the little child is gone.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>> They've stumbled
into some portal,

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.440 align:middle line:90%
and they can't get back.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>> That's frightening.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It is frightening.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:90%
And where are they going?

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:90%
We're not quite sure.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Reminds me of The Twilight
Zone show, Little Girl Lost,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
where a girl stumbled
from her bed into a wall,

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.430 align:middle line:90%
which happened to be a portal.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:90%
And she was gone.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And all you could hear her
say, mommy, where are you?

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Daddy, where are you?

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.963 align:middle line:90%
And so they wake up.

00:06:23.963 --> 00:06:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>> They're just out of sync.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're look
for their child.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up having
to go through the portal,

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:84%
reaching in, grabbed
her, and pulled her back.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Each dimension has its
parameters of frequency.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And it can be off just a
little and open a portal.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Or if you understand
how to dial into it,

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:90%
you can open them yourself.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Clifford Stone was
a Vietnam veteran,

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.090 align:middle line:84%
talks about his experience
in Vietnam on Gaia's Cosmic

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Disclosure.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.490 align:middle line:10%
>> So I slung my M-16
over my shoulder.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going around
looking at the craft.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:10%
I go around to the tail
section, looking at it.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.930 align:middle line:90%
Go around to the other side.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.970 align:middle line:84%
When I get around
to the other side,

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
there in the shrubbery,
coming out of it

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
are little gray entities,
about 4-foot tall.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.510 align:middle line:84%
As they came towards,
me I'm looking at them

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and thought, what's
going on here?

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.060 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't say anything.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.010 align:middle line:84%
But until the day I
die, I'll remember

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
what the little entity set
to me and the way he said it.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:90%
It was like, Clifford.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.650 align:middle line:10%
You are not supposed to be here.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.360 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I got
my M-16, pulled it up.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:84%
You normally don't carry your
weapon on full automatic.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I put it on full automatic,
and I started to fire.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:90%
And I yelled out, VC, VC.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:84%
No reason for us to
believe that night.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea why
I was yelling at.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And that was to alert
the other troops that we

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
were no longer alone, that there
were a number of little guys

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:90%
there, I'll put it that way.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, everyone else
started to shoot.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:84%
But our bullets was
having no effect.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:84%
You should see where the bullets
would bounce off of them, where

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:90%
they were going through them.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
All we saw was the
flash from our weapons.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:90%
This was daylight.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't tell
what was going on.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Were other people
witnessing these little beings?

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Every soldier there was.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>> How many beings were there?

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> There were about 15 or 20.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And normally, you wouldn't
think there'd be that many.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason, they
followed us all the way back

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.550 align:middle line:90%
to that little stream.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:90%
We got across it.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Then they stopped.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.195 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you just
exhaust your firepower,

00:08:52.195 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and nothing happened, and said,
what are we're going to do now?

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.987 align:middle line:90%
They're still looking at us.

00:08:55.987 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.770 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>> What did the commander say?

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>> He wasn't saying anything.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:90%
He was with us going back.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Later on, he asked
me, do you have

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:90%
any idea what happened there?

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a clue.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Laurie, Clifford Stone
is pretty convincing there.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard very similar
stories a number of times.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, why would
somebody make this up?

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> They wouldn't.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> They wouldn't.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.210 align:middle line:84%
It just brings too
much controversy,

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:84%
too much skepticism,
and puts a person

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:84%
in a very awkward
position where people

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:90%
are looking at them sideways.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that these
Vietnam vets are making this

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:90%
They happened on both sides.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:84%
The Vietnamese also
have their own stories.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Under hypnotherapy, would
someone like a Clifford Stone

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:90%
even reveal more things?

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>> They do, especially if they
had a singular experience,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:84%
where there was maybe a
piece of missing time,

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.770 align:middle line:84%
or they disappeared in front
of their friends and then were

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:84%
brought back later
without memory.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We do then regress them
and open up that memory,

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:84%
retrieve the memory,
and examine it.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it dangerous to
regress people sometimes?

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never seen
it be dangerous ever.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it healthy?

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It's extremely healthy.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>> For the individual?

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's extremely healthy
because for decades,

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:84%
some people have the
same thought going around

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:90%
in their head.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Was that real?

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's an indicator
to the conscious mind

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.250 align:middle line:84%
that there is some
unsettled business

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:41.200 align:middle line:84%
in the unconscious that needs
to be reviewed and settled.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>> If you had to categorize your
career today, subject matter,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:90%
what would you say?

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:90%
You're a paranormal expert?

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I have some expertise
in the paranormal world

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
because there's a bleed-through
between that, ufology,

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:90%
and the abduction phenomena.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:08.870 align:middle line:84%
But my expertise is in the
experiencer regressing them

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and compiling information,
creating commonalities,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:84%
so that we can see where
the similarities are,

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:84%
so we can begin to see
what their agenda is.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Why they're here?

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.860 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Why are they taking people?

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:90%
And really, who are they?

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many different
extraterrestrial experiences,

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:84%
not only the smaller
Greys, but the Zetas, who

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.940 align:middle line:90%
look very similar to the Greys.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't tell by the
picture there with Clifford.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
those weren't Greys.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
what he described

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:84%
sounded more like
Zeta, primarily because

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.100 align:middle line:84%
of their communication and
the way that they think.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:84%
The smaller Greys are primarily
artificial intelligence.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability to think,
but they're limited in that.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So tall Greys, the
more sentient being,

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:84%
who is like us, fully aware
of themselves, and not AI.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Are the smaller
Greys more robotic?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Very limited in
what they can do.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:90%
They're the Gophers.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Go bring me this person.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>> The androids they've created.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:90%
The R2-D2s.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:90%
And they can communicate.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.595 align:middle line:84%
And they can think,
but they're limited.

00:12:23.595 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>> They can function.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:90%
They functioned quite a bit.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Is the field of ufology
and the field of paranormal

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:90%
investigating, are they related?

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I've seen happen over
the years are people who have

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
had extraterrestrial experiences
are now open to paranormal

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if their
particular frequency or energy

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.810 align:middle line:84%
has changed in
them, that they're

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:84%
more able to perceive
this, or if their mind is

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:84%
opened in a way that
it's just allowed.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But people who have
had both paranormal

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrial
experiences do come back

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:90%
with a higher sense of psychism.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Especially within
the UFO phenomena,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
there's a halo effect
for two or three

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
weeks after an abduction
where people are highly

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.580 align:middle line:90%
intuitive, slightly telepathic.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.900 align:middle line:90%
It's quite interesting.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
that's because they're

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of that or
during the abduction, that's

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:90%
how they communicate.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they become more
spiritual, Laurie?

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It is my opinion
that an empowered,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
recovered abductee does ask the
larger questions about reality.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:84%
The reality that
we live in today

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:84%
doesn't encompass the
existence of non-human beings.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But when you do have an
experience like that,

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and your pushed
into that reality,

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and you have no choice but to
understand that you have seen

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:84%
something or
experienced something,

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.130 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask, what does
this mean to the consciousness

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:90%
of the human?

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And I see that they
become more aware

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:84%
of the multidimensional
aspect of the human soul.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And so within the
abduction phenomena,

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:84%
I do think that some
of the hybridization

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.220 align:middle line:84%
program with the
Greys and the humans

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:90%
isn't so much to make a hybrid.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I think it's to hijack the
ascension process of the human,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.490 align:middle line:84%
as I do not believe that
the Greys have a soul.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you know,
human, the word hue

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
is the word we use
to measure the depth

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.410 align:middle line:90%
or saturation of light.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Man comes from the
word manifestation.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:84%
To come into the physical
or to be embodied.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:84%
A human is a light
embodied being.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:84%
This knocks on the door of
the multidimensional aspect.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.650 align:middle line:90%
We have to consider this.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Other entities
know that the human

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:90%
continues after the body falls.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the Greys
who lived between 900

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and 1,100 years would very
much like to have a soul

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and see what that eternal
process looks like for them.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:84%
How do we know that not
every living being does not

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:90%
have a soul?

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we understand that
the lower frequential beings,

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
such as the Greys,
don't have a soul.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:84%
They have programmed it
out of themselves perhaps,

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:90%
or maybe they never had one.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
But they have moved in the area
of technology as their god.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And they can
function without a soul?

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>> You can function
without a soul.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.670 align:middle line:90%
The body can.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:84%
The soul moves in and out
of the body all the time.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Soul moves out of the body
sometimes during dreaming,

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:84%
lucid dreaming, astral trips,
out-of-body experiences,

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:90%
near-death experiences.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
All of these indicate the
soul leaving the body,

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:84%
coming back with
additional information.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you believe in God?

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe in a high
intellectual, loving entity.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>> A creator?

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Form of creator.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Not God in the biblical form.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Certainly not in
that way at all.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But something that is
much higher than that

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:84%
because our understanding,
there's a good and a bad.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:90%
It's evil, or it's good.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But what I'd like to
have people understand

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
is that the highest,
good and bad don't exist.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:90%
There is no such thing.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.830 align:middle line:90%
It just simply doesn't exist.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Good and bad are
conceptualized ideas

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.470 align:middle line:90%
that are created by humans.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.110 align:middle line:84%
But above all that
is a blissfulness,

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:90%
an incredible, fluid--

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:84%
a fluid understanding of
expanded consciousness,

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:02.280 align:middle line:84%
where you move with the mind,
and you don't require a body.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But you do believe
in a divine creator?

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe in divinity.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.720 align:middle line:90%
Creation.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.119 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not an accident, Laurie.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It certainly can't
be an accident.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But we can look at
creation on many levels.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:90%
We can look at evolution.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.849 align:middle line:84%
We can say we came
from a salamander.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:30.380 align:middle line:84%
We can see how many
sciences have indicated

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:90%
evolution in that way.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:90%
But it's not so much the body.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:90%
It's the consciousness.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.830 align:middle line:90%
It's the light behind the eyes.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.500 align:middle line:84%
It's what resides
in the body that's

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:84%
more important
because it surpasses

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:84%
the third dimensional
understanding of life.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Matias De Stefano was on
a Gaia special presentation.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:90%
We call it the Gaia Events Plus.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about the
power of being a human being.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Humanity has two different
paths to understand why we

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:10%
exist here.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:90%
One coming from the stars.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.570 align:middle line:90%
One coming from the Earth.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:84%
But mainly, there is a third
one, which is the universe,

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and the reason why the universe
decided to create humans.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we have
to remember that we are not

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:28.190 align:middle line:84%
the intelligent
species in this planet,

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:90%
if someone believes that.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:37.420 align:middle line:84%
We are learning about ourselves,
but we are not in this planet.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
concept that I would

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:90%
like for everyone to change.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:90%
We are not on Earth.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:90%
We are Earth.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:90%
It's very different.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:90%
We are not on this planet.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:90%
We are this planet.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And this takes us to the
concept of cells again.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Every living being every
living creature in this planet

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:84%
is a projection of
this planet, has

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:84%
been designed in
this planet, has

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:90%
been involved in this planet.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.190 align:middle line:90%
So we are this planet.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.270 align:middle line:90%
We have eaten.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.180 align:middle line:84%
We have been designed from
the very chemical components.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:90%
So we are this planet.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So when we think
about humanity, we

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.538 align:middle line:84%
have to think about the
neurons of the planet.

00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think
of that, Laurie?

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.220 align:middle line:90%
He is also describing a tree.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Anything that comes
from the planet.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.330 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.640 align:middle line:90%
He sounds very interesting.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Not necessarily human.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Not necessarily human.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that's talking
about being human in Earth,

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
they're moving in
the right direction.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.670 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple ways to look
at it, but this is the thing.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:53.020 align:middle line:84%
The humans are actually
incredibly powerful entities.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:10%
We are co-creators
of this reality.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:10%
And the human exists in other
planets, as well as Earth.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Humans are seeded
throughout the universe

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.410 align:middle line:90%
or throughout the multiverse.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's not so much
about the physical existence

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
It's about what
happens after this.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:84%
The idea about being human,
and I honor the human life.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:90%
I love humans.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.160 align:middle line:84%
They only have one thing
to do, is to master love

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and fear as we move
towards human attainment

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:84%
to be the best humans
that we can be.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.890 align:middle line:90%
That's really all we have to do.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand the
dualistic nature of both love

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:90%
and fear.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But those are the only two
things that we have to do.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Our existence, each
life is but a blink

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
of an eye in the time
spans of existence.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:84%
We're here, and we do
have a mission, so to say.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:84%
We have an opportunity
to create, and achieve,

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:90%
and to understand.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is not really to
get to the top of the mountain.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It's to move the boulders
for those that follow,

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:90%
to make the path easier.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But we live in a very
externalized world,

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
where everybody's ideas
and thought processes are

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.040 align:middle line:90%
outside of themselves.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
making a lot of money

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
or having a nice
car or a big house.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:84%
These things aren't as important
as an intrinsic understanding

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:84%
of the self and creating
an internal alignment

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:84%
between the layers
of consciousness,

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:90%
creating enlightenment.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment allows us to see
that there's a much larger life

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.728 align:middle line:90%
than just what we have here.

00:21:40.728 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always said, when you
get to the top of the mountain,

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.700 align:middle line:84%
if you're not there with
other people, it's not fun.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.320 align:middle line:90%
What's the point then, right?

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:84%
The idea is we are
in this together.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>> You had an episode when your
mother was pregnant with you.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Do you care to
share that with us?

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:03.750 align:middle line:84%
My mother related to me after
I was 50 years old that--

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>> 50?

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I thought you were 25.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:90%
But I was once.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.230 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:84%
She had contacted me after
seeing me on a TV program.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And she was impressed that I run
support groups to help people

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.630 align:middle line:84%
with experiences and that I had
knowledge of the UFO existence.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And she had told me that
during the nine months

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.420 align:middle line:84%
that she was pregnant with
m, and I recorded this phone

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
conversation because it
was really out of the blue.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And she said that
she had been abducted

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:90%
practically every month.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:84%
They told her all the time that
they weren't interested in her.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:84%
They were interested
in her baby.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:84%
That they weren't
going to hurt her.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
They were just checking
up on the baby.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And so she had a very
difficult time bonding with me

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:90%
and never did raise me.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you a star seed?

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Aren't we all to some degree?

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you may
be more than most.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we all have
extraterrestrial DNA.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that the DNA that
they refer to as junk DNA

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:90%
is indeed extraterrestrial.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>> When you were born, they
didn't take you or anything,

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:90%
did they?

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not quite sure.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that she said,
on the day that I was born,

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.150 align:middle line:84%
she had gone
outside that morning

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and sat in a lounge
chair in the backyard.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Nine months pregnant, hot.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:90%
It was late September.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And two beings appeared
on either side of her.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:84%
They moved with her
through the Apple Orchard.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.400 align:middle line:84%
She said her feet
were on the ground.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And in the clearing
where the tractors

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:84%
turned during harvest time,
there was a UFO above that.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Instantly, she was on
the UFO, where she then

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:84%
said that the UFO seemed
much larger inside,

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:84%
as if it had displayed some
form of morphogenic quality.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:90%
She was then placed on a table.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her,
what kind of table?

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it looked
like an ironing board.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It was shaped like
an ironing board.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And they stood behind her,
and calmed her down, and then

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.540 align:middle line:90%
did a plethora of exams.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:84%
She later woke in the
yard, in the grass,

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:90%
in labor, calling out for help.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.000 align:middle line:90%
And nobody woke in the house.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.410 align:middle line:90%
The neighbors heard her.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.530 align:middle line:84%
They roused the
household, and they then

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.780 align:middle line:84%
brought her to the
hospital where I was born.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, both my parents have
black hair and brown eyes

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and are both extremely
short people.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.067 align:middle line:90%
And for whatever reason--

00:24:42.067 --> 00:24:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>> You're not short.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Not short.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:90%
She just didn't bond.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:90%
She had a difficult time.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:57.352 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure she wasn't believed
as she had told her therapist,

00:24:57.352 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and her therapist
actually told her

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:84%
to stop talking about
extraterrestrials

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.360 align:middle line:84%
because you might lose
your other children.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.450 align:middle line:90%
And she stopped talking.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And she said she
started writing it down.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.387 align:middle line:90%
And she kept a journal.

00:25:12.387 --> 00:25:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Is your mother
still with us today?

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> She's still alive today.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Does she still bring this up?

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>> She's suffering from a
form of dementia currently.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What is alchemical
hypnotherapy?

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Alchemy is the art
of transformation.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:84%
So alchemical hypnotherapy is
transformational hypnotherapy,

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:84%
where we can take a very
traumatic experience,

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.900 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
extraterrestrial or even

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:84%
child abuse, whatever
it is, and transform it

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:90%
into a higher understanding.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:84%
A higher and a
deeper understanding

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:84%
allows the person freedom in
self-acceptance and personal

00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
empowerment, having them take
their next step in the world.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you apply it?

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, alchemy is
just transforming.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody is very trapped
in a negative experience,

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.740 align:middle line:90%
we show them the freedom.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean, it's
not making gold?

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I wish.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.400 align:middle line:84%
It is making gold out of a
negative experience actually.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.010 align:middle line:84%
It's bringing a person to
a higher understanding,

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:90%
so they can let things go.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if
you're trapped in trauma,

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.600 align:middle line:84%
you're not operating
from your true self.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:39.690 align:middle line:84%
If you have negative
images in the mind

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:84%
or if you have feelings about
yourself that aren't positive,

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.370 align:middle line:84%
if you don't think
you're good enough.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And many people do
suffer from this.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.170 align:middle line:84%
What happens is they can't
reach their potential.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:84%
They sense their potential,
but they can't tap that.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>> They can't get into it.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We help them find
their true self.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And another way of
seeing the true self

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.810 align:middle line:90%
is seeing the spiritual self.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The alien abduction
phenomena, Laurie,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.130 align:middle line:84%
seems to have
dwindled a little bit.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem to be as
prevalent as it used to be.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:84%
We used to have experts like
John Mack, Budd Hopkins, people

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:90%
They're not with us anymore.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it still happening?

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Every single day.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I can't keep up with the amount
of people that are asking

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.250 align:middle line:90%
for regression in that area.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:84%
From all walks of life,
all around the world,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.700 align:middle line:84%
every single day,
somebody reaches out.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Many people reach out, and
they've had an experience.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm seeing
right now though,

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.770 align:middle line:84%
it's actually an
older clientele that

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:84%
had experiences in the 70s or
80s and they want answers now.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.243 align:middle line:84%
They just don't want
to die without knowing

00:27:52.243 --> 00:27:53.160 align:middle line:90%
what happened to them.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.618 align:middle line:84%
>> They're frustrated,
aren't they?

00:27:54.618 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>> They're frustrated because
they can't get the truth from

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.290 align:middle line:90%
any government agency.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you past
life regress somebody?

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, time is where you
place your consciousness.

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we bring them
back to another time

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.070 align:middle line:90%
through hypnotic regression.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you use a pendulum
or anything like that?

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.920 align:middle line:90%
I use words and my voice.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Georgina Cannon was on
the show discussing how

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.540 align:middle line:84%
the modalities help us heal
ourselves and bring change.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Give me your reaction
to this when we see it.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:32.290 align:middle line:10%
What is a hypnotist and past
life regressionist anyway?

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:37.180 align:middle line:10%
>> A hypnotist is a person who
is able to facilitate others

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.608 align:middle line:10%
and themselves into
a state of hypnosis,

00:28:39.608 --> 00:28:40.900 align:middle line:10%
which is like an altered state.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.190 align:middle line:10%
It's the zone, if you like.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.660 align:middle line:90%
It's the alpha brainwaves.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.760 align:middle line:84%
The same brain
waves as meditation

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.240 align:middle line:84%
that bypasses the conscious
mind to access the subconscious.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.723 align:middle line:84%
Subconscious, as you
know, is our blueprint.

00:28:51.723 --> 00:28:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to make change,

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:84%
you need to get
into the blueprint.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:56.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's what hypnosis does.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And being a past
life regressionist?

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I use it to get
into past lives.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Past lives are wonderful
tool, so that we

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.470 align:middle line:90%
can learn to better this life.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:06.760 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's only a tool.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe it's woo-woo.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a tool that we
use to understand who we are,

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and how we are, and the patterns
we bring in with us that

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:90%
help us live this life fully.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you convinced that the
past lives that you pick up

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.360 align:middle line:84%
from people after you
put them under are real,

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:84%
or are they making
these things up?

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't believe you
can make up emotions.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And most, I would say
80% of the past lives

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.330 align:middle line:84%
include some emotion
of some sort.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Either joy or
sadness, fear, sorrow.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.520 align:middle line:90%
You can't make that up.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're so impactful that
they make a difference when

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.560 align:middle line:90%
someone comes back into today.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:90%
They say, oh, my God.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Now I know why I
have a fear of water.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And now I know why I keep
choosing people like I do.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Or I have a mole on my face.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Chances are that
carries through.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:29:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.860 align:middle line:10%
>> How many past lives
can an individual have?

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>> In my case,
probably eight or nine.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:90%
But I'm sure there's many more.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:09.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure there is.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And they could be lives
that last full term, right?

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:90%
80, 85 years old.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.872 align:middle line:84%
Or they could be maybe they died
early in birth, or who knows?

00:30:18.872 --> 00:30:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And they could also
come from other planets.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:21.640 align:middle line:90%
They're not necessarily--

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
come from this planet.

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.232 align:middle line:84%
Now I seem to have been
surprised when she said

00:30:28.232 --> 00:30:29.440 align:middle line:90%
they come from other planets.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.280 align:middle line:90%
You agree with her?

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I've had that happen
multiple times.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.560 align:middle line:90%
And she's right.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:40.645 align:middle line:84%
We do bring forward with
us energy from a past life.

00:30:40.645 --> 00:30:44.680 align:middle line:84%
It generally will display
itself as some form of block.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And we can change those patterns
and help move the person

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.830 align:middle line:90%
towards human attainment.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we being
manipulated, Laurie?

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Every single day.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> By ETs?

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We're manipulated
in so many ways.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.690 align:middle line:90%
We're manipulated by media.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.880 align:middle line:84%
We're manipulated by
government, education.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>> And most likely, ETs.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
Eisenhower did have contact

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.100 align:middle line:90%
with two separate races.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
was the first official

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.090 align:middle line:84%
contract in allowing
extraterrestrials

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.530 align:middle line:90%
to abduct people.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower allowed
250,000 abductees,

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and they continued to abduct
the entire family line.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.630 align:middle line:84%
As I had said earlier, the Greys
have a much longer lifespan.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So it only makes sense that
say a scientist of theirs

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:middle line:84%
would want to have
multiple generations,

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.700 align:middle line:84%
so they can get a
larger picture of us.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Are most of the abductees
brought back, or are they kept?

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a very
good question, George,

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.740 align:middle line:84%
because so many
people do disappear.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know if
that's an abduction.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Hundreds of thousands of
people on this planet disappear

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.690 align:middle line:90%
every year.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that there's a high
percentage is through abduction

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:05.110 align:middle line:90%
frankly.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.950 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Something's going on.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And sometimes, depending
on the experience,

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.500 align:middle line:90%
it's not all abduction.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's simply contact,
and people choose to go.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.440 align:middle line:84%
They choose to be engaged
with the Galactic Federation,

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.400 align:middle line:84%
or they choose to be engaged
with an off planet species,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.320 align:middle line:90%
and they might want to go.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.870 align:middle line:84%
What does the phrase
divine feminine mean?

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Divine feminine energy is
an energy that supersedes all

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:90%
other energies.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:43.600 align:middle line:84%
It's an energy that both men
and women have access to.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's a sense of
ease, a sense of love.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's an opportunity
to self-accept

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and to move towards a
place of empowerment

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and allow us to move
forward collectively.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So a divine feminine
energy would not

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.930 align:middle line:84%
allow war, for instance,
because there's

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:90%
equality within the divinity.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:90%
There's not superiority.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So if a person didn't
feel inferior or superior

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:16.570 align:middle line:84%
to any belief or to anyone,
there would be no conflict.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.570 align:middle line:84%
If an empowered person
comes across someone

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:84%
who has a different belief
system, it doesn't bother them.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.230 align:middle line:84%
They're empowered enough
to allow that person

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:29.230 align:middle line:84%
to have their thoughts because
what does it take from you?

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Takes nothing.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.570 align:middle line:84%
But if we can not
force that on others,

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:37.660 align:middle line:90%
then there's that sense of ease.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And that divine feminine
energy is that sense of ease.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Does that divine feminine
also apply to a male?

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:48.185 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:48.185 --> 00:33:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we call it
divine masculine?

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.700 align:middle line:90%
We cannot.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.280 align:middle line:84%
That would be a
patriarchal energy,

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and that's what our planet
is operating under right now.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Just asking.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Just asking.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.840 align:middle line:84%
How does it develop,
this divine feminine?

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Through honesty, integrity--

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:13.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Empathy?

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:14.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:34:14.539 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:84%
All the higher
frequency emotions.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Higher frequency emotions are
compassion, empathy, love,

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.889 align:middle line:90%
mercy, and true pity.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:27.870 align:middle line:90%
If you feel true pity.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:31.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Our world leaders should
have more of these attributes.

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.800 align:middle line:84%
That would make a
complete change.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.830 align:middle line:84%
That would move them into
the divine feminine energy.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
If they incorporated a
true sense of compassion,

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:47.960 align:middle line:84%
how then do you wipe out a
nation or create genocide?

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Can you tap into
someone's ability

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.830 align:middle line:84%
to tap into the divine
feminine under hypnotherapy?

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I think under hypnotherapy,
we're really operating in such

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:84%
an energy that many
things can happen.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I feel in many sessions a
divinity, divine energy.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I've also felt
extraterrestrial energy.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.440 align:middle line:90%
I also felt demonic energy.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So we've had multiple
things come through,

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:20.120 align:middle line:90%
and we just deal with it.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.780 align:middle line:84%
You teach and practice these
in workshops, don't you?

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm a masterminds teacher
for UrVeda at Consciousness

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge Community.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems, Laurie,
that nowadays,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.710 align:middle line:84%
these things are more
important than ever before.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:41.180 align:middle line:90%
That's my perception.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you're right.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, George.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.180 align:middle line:84%
These things are of
the utmost importance

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:53.530 align:middle line:84%
right now because people sense
the instability on the planet.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Lots of instability.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:36:00.510 align:middle line:84%
How can people kind of
embrace this divine feminine?

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really taking--

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to be
born with the quality?

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely not.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:08.210 align:middle line:84%
It really begins
with self-awareness.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Becoming aware of the self and
having a critical observation

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And then accepting it.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.295 align:middle line:84%
Accepting the good, the
bad, the indifferent.

00:36:18.295 --> 00:36:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the key, accepting.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Accepting it.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.820 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot change
which you cannot accept.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So you must look
clearly at the self.

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Accept it, embrace it.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:84%
The next step then is
a natural development

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and through enhancing those
energies towards mastering them

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.480 align:middle line:90%
towards self-actualization.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So that you can live the life
that you're comfortable with,

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.410 align:middle line:84%
the one that we always
dreamed of as children

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:48.200 align:middle line:84%
be fully self-actualized
is empowered.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And it begins with
self-acceptance.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>> One of your colleagues,
Dr. Theresa Bullard,

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:56.300 align:middle line:84%
was on Gaia's Mystery
Teachings, talking about some

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.800 align:middle line:84%
of the things you've
just mentioned.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.100 align:middle line:10%
>> While we all have both
feminine and masculine sides

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:10%
within us, most of us tend
to be predominant in one.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.550 align:middle line:10%
And what I mean by
that is that we all

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.800 align:middle line:10%
have an innate way
in which we tend

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.190 align:middle line:10%
to use and flow our energy.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:84%
This isn't about gender
identity or sexual orientation.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.280 align:middle line:84%
It's also not about
our personality

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and how we've been programmed
to behave in society.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.230 align:middle line:90%
This is about energy.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
we're born with.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And what we all need
to understand in order

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.280 align:middle line:90%
to heal this imbalance is this.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.070 align:middle line:84%
The value of the
feminine is the beauty

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.000 align:middle line:90%
of what dwells within us.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:90%
It's innate.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
requires outward demonstrations

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.310 align:middle line:84%
of achievement in order
to be deemed worthy.

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.340 align:middle line:90%
It's already worthy.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It's what gives us the power
to birth things into the world.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:54.450 align:middle line:90%
It's our innate creative gifts.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Men and women have both feminine
and masculine sides within.

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And the point is to
find the balance.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Women, we don't have
to prove anything.

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:08.780 align:middle line:84%
The feminine side of us can
birth things into the world,

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.380 align:middle line:90%
and that's powerful enough.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.080 align:middle line:84%
The masculine energy
tends to be more active,

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and it seeks to prove itself
by demonstrating its power

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.310 align:middle line:90%
and strength.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK for the masculine.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:84%
But as a woman, I found that
trying to be in that mode

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.670 align:middle line:84%
all the time is depleting,
and it makes us sick.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:30.400 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to be
all one or the other,

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.750 align:middle line:84%
but find your 70/30
balance point.

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, we see an imbalance
in the world around us,

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and that is a
reflection of what's

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.740 align:middle line:90%
happening within each of us.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.580 align:middle line:84%
The feminine needs to shift,
and women in particular

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.830 align:middle line:90%
can lead the way.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.320 align:middle line:84%
For men, they're going
to find that the more

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.090 align:middle line:84%
masculine approach
to things will

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.520 align:middle line:90%
be more energizing for them.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And the feminine aspects will
still be needed, but only 30%

00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.630 align:middle line:90%
of the time.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:01.390 align:middle line:90%
So this is really about energy.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And our indicators
are whether we're

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:08.723 align:middle line:84%
feeling depleted and drained
or restored and rejuvenated.

00:39:08.723 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>> You agree with her?

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.550 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, it isn't
about identification.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Masculine and feminine
isn't about identification.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a separate energy.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.710 align:middle line:90%
One is an act of energy.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:middle line:90%
One is a passive energy.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Both are required.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:28.460 align:middle line:90%
We need both.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>> When somebody
comes to you, Laurie,

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:34.010 align:middle line:84%
for some kind of
hypnotherapy session,

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:37.100 align:middle line:84%
what is that impetus that
got them to come to you

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.690 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>> They're in pain.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Emotional pain.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.560 align:middle line:90%
They want to heal.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.580 align:middle line:90%
They want truth.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.810 align:middle line:90%
They want answers.

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:47.090 align:middle line:90%
They want to recover.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they just want
to get off drugs.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:50.870 align:middle line:90%
They want to stop drinking.

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.640 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
why they drink.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand why
they're acting and living

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.430 align:middle line:84%
the way they do, and they
know it could be better.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.020 align:middle line:90%
I get them at their worst.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did they need help to
do exactly what you just said?

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Stop drinking, get off drugs.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they just
do it on their own?

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I don't know
why they're addicted.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.638 align:middle line:84%
And once they
understand the reason--

00:40:15.638 --> 00:40:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's your job to find out.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The energy shifts, and we begin
to move out of that process

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.300 align:middle line:90%
into a place of healing.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it because they're
depressed or something like

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.680 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes, they're depressed.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.040 align:middle line:10%
But we're living
in a world where

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.220 align:middle line:10%
everybody is judged,
engaged, and people

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.730 align:middle line:10%
are feeling less than.

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.490 align:middle line:90%
They don't see what I see.

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:42.650 align:middle line:90%
I do see the light in everyone.

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:45.030 align:middle line:90%
I sense their potential.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.840 align:middle line:90%
I love the humans.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>> We have an
enormous greatness.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Everything on this
planet we created.

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.170 align:middle line:84%
We took stone from the Earth
and turned it into steel.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:01.310 align:middle line:84%
We made swords, cars,
skyscrapers, satellites,

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:02.190 align:middle line:90%
and rocket ships.

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> We're brilliant.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We're brilliant
and resourceful.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have to
take that next step.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.760 align:middle line:90%
We've built a planet.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Now we need to learn how to live
in it with that sense of ease,

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that sense of ease
in the mind and body.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.550 align:middle line:90%
A sense of community.

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:22.920 align:middle line:90%
A collective consciousness.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It must be gratifying
for you to see the results

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:31.020 align:middle line:84%
of your efforts after somebody
come to you with these issues.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm very happy for them
and pleased that they can move

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.990 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they ever break
down, crying with you,

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.500 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>> All the time.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.080 align:middle line:90%
It's very emotional work.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I bet.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And I try to be as calm and
balanced as possible to hold

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:54.160 align:middle line:84%
whatever energy is necessary
to make them feel safe enough

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.560 align:middle line:84%
to move through
whatever they have.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Because I have no judgment.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how or why
somebody is the way they are.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:09.480 align:middle line:84%
As long as they can look at what
it is, accept it, and desire

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.470 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.040 align:middle line:84%
As a hypnotherapist,
I can't create change.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.260 align:middle line:90%
They have to have that desire.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Can't make you do something
against your will.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:24.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you're willing to
change, to grow, to move,

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:25.740 align:middle line:90%
then you will.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>> How do people get a hold
of you, Laurie, for help?

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:32.920 align:middle line:10%
>> At trueyouhypnotherapy.com is
the best way to get hold of me.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for being
on Beyond Belief.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
having me, George.

00:42:36.078 --> 00:42:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you did
a wonderful job.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> It's good to see you again.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been a long time.

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad to be here.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad there are people
like you on this planet.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, what a nice thing to say.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything
else to say after that?

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:51.380 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:56.000 align:middle line:90%
