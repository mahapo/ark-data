>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:12.554 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.260 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.579 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:84%
We all talk about the
weather, but how many of us

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:84%
are actually caught
in weather like this?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Scott Stevens with
us, weatherman.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT STEVENS:
What a sweet storm.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.567 align:middle line:84%
And the intensity of these
thunderstorms, George,

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:84%
is incredible over the
past couple of years.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.068 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, it is.

00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:53.216 align:middle line:90%
That's a sweet rain storm.

00:00:53.216 --> 00:00:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And here in
Colorado, if you were

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.985 align:middle line:84%
around last
September or August--

00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: --woo.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.341 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We were coming
for "Beyond Belief"

00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and we had flown in
right after the floods.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:84%
But some of the roads and parts
of the freeway were shut down,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:90%
and it was a mess.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It was.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was in
St. Louis, Scott,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.546 align:middle line:84%
back in 1993 when they
have the so-called 500--

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:14.171 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yes.

00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Year flood.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I saw it too.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And know what
a 500 year flood means,

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
of course, as you
know, is that they

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.836 align:middle line:84%
expect a major flood like
that every 500 years.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:25.210 align:middle line:84%
What they can't
tell you, though,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.080 align:middle line:84%
is right after that flood,
the next one could start.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.049 align:middle line:90%
It's any time--

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Between.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in those--

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: An interval.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --500 years.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:90%
And that was unbelievable.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:84%
We went on a top of a hill
and looked down, and actually

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:84%
saw a shopping center
area totally flooded

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:90%
out, eight feet tall of water.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Unreal.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.419 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the big question
is, is it does subside?

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It does.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where does it go?

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: The Gulf
of Mexico, hopefully.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: But a
lot of it should

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.803 align:middle line:84%
soak in and recharge
that groundwater.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there like
little canals in the planet?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean once that water soaks
in, does it just keep going down

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:90%
or where does it go?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Boy, that's
another question.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Most of it should end up
in one of the watersheds,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
either Pacific, Atlantic,
or Gulf for Americans.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.531 align:middle line:90%
But a lot it has got to soak in.

00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing with
those kind of thunderstorms

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.876 align:middle line:84%
is that we get so much runoff
and it happens so fast, so

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
rapidly, and so
often, the ground

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:90%
is powder dry when it begins.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So that you could have a three
inch rainfall in an hour,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.629 align:middle line:84%
and yet only that much
of the soil is hydrated.

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.544 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: The rest is gone.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you come back
and do the climatology,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:84%
you run down the
numbers for the month.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we're right at normal.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.316 align:middle line:84%
But then the trees are
brown, the crops are dry.

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The grass
is drying out.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: And we're stressed.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, that is
the challenge when

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
we see these kind of
crazy, crazy storms.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you mentioned,
the Mississippi in '93,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
we kind of had a flooding
situation in 2008 as well.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.624 align:middle line:84%
But then the next year, the
barges can't move up the mess--

00:02:56.624 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.955 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: --because
it's so dry.

00:02:58.955 --> 00:02:59.769 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:84%
They've been talking
about a drought,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and then we get heavy
rains the next year.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:90%
It's all topsy-turvy.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.959 align:middle line:90%
What's up is down.

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And that's what
we're trying to get used to.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:90%
And so farmers, what do I do?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:90%
What do I plant?

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Do I plant
drought-resistant crops,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
or they get flooded
out in June and we

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:84%
have to plant again
when the fields dry out

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:90%
in late June and July.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.419 align:middle line:84%
And can they then
get the sorghum?

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Can they get the
soybeans, or do they

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
have to go to a
short season crop?

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's expensive.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.885 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: You've
got to go to Pioneer.

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle line:84%
You've got to Monsanto
to buy these seeds again.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a challenge for
us, as businessmen, as farmers,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:90%
to accommodate the weather.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember the old
Farmers Almanac, and those

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Almanacs were able to
predict the weather.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always took a
look at them and go oh.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Boy, were they fun.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:90%
They're fun.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But my point is
wasn't weather more predictable

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:90%
some time ago, than it is today?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I believe so.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was why I
ended up on this path,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
is because in the late '90s, I
was throwing my hands up, going

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:90%
what is going on here?

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:90%
This is weather.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:90%
We can see it coming for miles.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:90%
We could see the whole planet.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:84%
We have an understanding
of how it works.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.952 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or we think we do.

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so that
was my frustration

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:90%
is failing forecast.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.256 align:middle line:90%
And I'm good.

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:84%
But then every year it
was a little bit less,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.193 align:middle line:84%
and I would read the discussions
out of the Weather Prediction

00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:24.772 align:middle line:84%
Center in DC, and they
were like oh, the models

00:04:24.772 --> 00:04:25.730 align:middle line:90%
are all over the place.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.604 align:middle line:84%
We kind of don't know
what's going to happen.

00:04:27.604 --> 00:04:29.762 align:middle line:84%
So they would give
us potentials,

00:04:29.762 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and then close by
saying, all we could do

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:84%
is issue a low
confidence forecast.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.855 align:middle line:84%
And so for us in the field,
interfacing with the public,

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:84%
we're like OK, this is what
we think is going to happen.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.324 align:middle line:84%
The guys in DC, and
the latest data says,

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:44.240 align:middle line:84%
well, this is probably
what the storm will do.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.125 align:middle line:84%
And then as we
talked earlier, there

00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:90%
is this technology happening.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I
learned is I'm not

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:84%
forecasting the natural
processes of this planet

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I have to anticipate,
not forecast,

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:90%
but anticipate an agenda.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And if the agent is drought,
then the trend is your friend,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:90%
and that's what you forecast.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This
predictability, I mean

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.264 align:middle line:84%
there are some weather
related websites

00:05:08.264 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:84%
that are out there, that give
you forecasts for two or three

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:90%
weeks out.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.085 align:middle line:84%
How in the heck can you do
that when you might not even

00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:84%
be able to predict what's
going to happen tomorrow?

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Indeed.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, it is
more difficult to now cast,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
within the next six hours,
than it is six and 16 days out.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.266 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really.

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:27.265 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: That is true.

00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to Sandy,
Hurricane Sandy.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.361 align:middle line:84%
That was a big weather
event that we all recall.

00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:35.444 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the one
that went up North, right?

00:05:35.444 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Hm-hmm.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Just prior to election time.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hit New
Jersey, wiped that out.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: What I saw was
that the models initially

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.750 align:middle line:84%
had let that hurricane recurve
out in the North Atlantic.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And then an email came
in one day, morning,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.587 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, this looks like
it could be a monster storm.

00:05:52.587 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm like nah, the models
are taking it out to sea.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked again, I'm
like, that's interesting.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, I did some
more looking around,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and then I got under
the water vapor imagery,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.586 align:middle line:84%
so you can see the vapor
flowing in the atmosphere.

00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw was an
impulse that would eventually

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.580 align:middle line:84%
be responsible for
impacting Sandy,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:90%
just emerging from Siberia.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And as it got within view,
there were all these trails,

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:84%
[MOUTH SOUND] just
hitting Sandy.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean this is intense.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And so, some of the models,
the European models,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:90%
brought the storm ashore.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.495 align:middle line:84%
The American models, the GFS,
were taking it out to sea.

00:06:28.495 --> 00:06:29.786 align:middle line:90%
I thought OK.

00:06:29.786 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It didn't
go out to sea.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.201 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No, it didn't.

00:06:32.201 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:84%
But if they're engineering
this that intently,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:84%
then I've got to change how
I'm going to view the storm.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.410 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
recurve it ashore.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.328 align:middle line:84%
So they know days ahead of time,
exactly what's going to happen.

00:06:43.328 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're forcing
the jetstream

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
to conform to some resonance
pattern, to trap a storm

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:90%
and keep it in this path.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And the trails
don't do it per say.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
They just give them
guidelines so they

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.330 align:middle line:84%
can see where
everything is gong.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost
like a horse race.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: True.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.844 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a
horse race, you can

00:07:00.844 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
predict the outcome
of the horse,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.840 align:middle line:84%
because he's pretty--
runs to form.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.125 align:middle line:84%
What you can't
predict is the jockey.

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: The rider.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.583 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is he
going to do today?

00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Is he playing around?

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Is he going to be honest?

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Is he not?

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:84%
These are variables
you cannot predict.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if weather
predicting is the same thing,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:84%
where you can predict the
normal weather patterns

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:90%
and what's expected.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
But then if you inject
TARP or manipulation,

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.937 align:middle line:90%
you can't predict that anymore.

00:07:32.937 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And that was what
I came to terms

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.370 align:middle line:90%
with is there's some delta.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Some change in value.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's temperature,
wind, moisture,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:84%
or some other more
abstract feature

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
that is not in the textbooks
that they're playing with.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that introduces
this uncertainty

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:90%
in our ability to forecast.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
great frustration.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Standing up in front
of thousands of people

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
and giving a forecast,
knowing full well

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that I'm just doing
the best I can.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And you come in the next day
and you're like, sorry guys.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Blew that one.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.289 align:middle line:90%
But I can't tell you why.

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
go to be upsetting.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.579 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It was.

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
miss a forecast,

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.885 align:middle line:90%
do you take it personally?

00:08:14.885 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Why?

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:90%
What did I miss?

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:90%
What did I not see?

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
did I not know that?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened, and
this is when I'm looking back

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.780 align:middle line:84%
to the imaging, I'm like
oh, there's these warmings.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:84%
On TV, they're showing
a satellite imagery,

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.397 align:middle line:90%
it's almost always infrared.

00:08:32.397 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So they're looking at the
temperature of the cloud tops.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:84%
The colder the cloud top
gets, the taller it is,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:90%
the higher it is in the sky.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:84%
And so the taller
the thunderstorm,

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
the colder the top, the
greater the instability

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:90%
below it to volt that storm up.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And with the skalar technology
we talked about earlier,

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
if you begin to warm the top
of a storm, the updraft fails.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason for this warm
parcel to move into warmer air.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I don't
want to go there.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:90%
The buoyancy is gone.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:03.600 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I saw.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.152 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
pretty standard.

00:09:05.152 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It is.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.568 align:middle line:90%
That is standard.

00:09:06.568 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:90%
That is standard thermodynamics.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, there were these warming
holes showing up in the storms,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I realized that
I can't forecast any longer.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I can't do it to
the standard that I

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.970 align:middle line:90%
had become accustomed to.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why manipulate a
little storm, like we just saw?

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because
it's part of the whole.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:28.610 align:middle line:90%
Part of the whole.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.204 align:middle line:84%
There is no part that isn't
connected to the rest of it.

00:09:33.204 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like an Olympic
size swimming

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.840 align:middle line:84%
pool and a small child
playing in a corner.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.269 align:middle line:90%
Those ripples radiate across--

00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are--

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: --the whole
volume of the pool.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.521 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --what they are.

00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Once you start them, they--

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.599 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: They go.

00:09:42.599 --> 00:09:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And so this is another
reason for the chemtrails.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to arrest
the movement of a wave form,

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:84%
you run a line and
then re-introduce

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.830 align:middle line:84%
a counterintuitive wave
or a canceling wave,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.396 align:middle line:84%
and it voids the activity,
and it cancels it

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:58.770 align:middle line:84%
from moving beyond
that boundary.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a picture
of what looks like a chemtrail,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:02.744 align:middle line:90%
right up here.

00:10:02.744 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that for us?

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.576 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:10:04.576 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:84%
This shot was sent
to me by a viewer

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.965 align:middle line:84%
of my site,
weatherwars.info, and it

00:10:08.965 --> 00:10:11.680 align:middle line:90%
was Italy in May of 2005.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can see a
square, a pyramid,

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.357 align:middle line:84%
essentially a diamond
standing on its end.

00:10:16.357 --> 00:10:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's weird.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It is truly weird.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
dark hole in the middle

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:84%
that this trail flies
precisely through.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And what's curious is once
the trail, the bright side,

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
the upper part hits that
hole, the other side,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.645 align:middle line:84%
the behavior of the trail
is changed entirely,

00:10:31.645 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and is much, much
dimmer, even though that

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
is the more recent
aspect of the trail.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So these trails
remained illuminated,

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.480 align:middle line:84%
when they're supposed to
be-- how can I say this.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:90%
There's different mixtures.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:84%
One will reveal the
presence of moisture.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.070 align:middle line:84%
One will reveal the presence
of upward vertical velocity.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:84%
One will reveal the presence
of ionizationed molecules.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.670 align:middle line:84%
There's many agendas
and many mixtures.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.395 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
going to build a house,

00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to do
it with just a hammer.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:84%
You need a screwdriver, you
need nails, you need wood,

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:90%
you need other tools.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this being done
primarily for economic gain?

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it being done for warfare?

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.607 align:middle line:84%
Are they trying to
cripple other nations?

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:15.440 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.406 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: All of that.

00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:90%
All of that.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I,
in the beginning,

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm like who's doing this?

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Is it Russians
against Americans?

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Americans against Chinese?

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Or is this--

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or us against us.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.481 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Us against us.

00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Or is it this one world
order against everyone.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And so that we're all
victims, as Defense Secretary

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.342 align:middle line:90%
Cohen called, ecoterrorism.

00:11:36.342 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's essentially
what I settled on.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:84%
That it doesn't matter
what nation you're in,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.050 align:middle line:84%
we are under the thumb of
a power structure, that

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:90%
is intent on harming us.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's insane,
when you think about it.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: And it's wrong.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:90%
It's wrong, George.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that can be changed,

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.364 align:middle line:84%
I believe, but only
with awareness.

00:11:56.364 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
went on the street

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and interviewed
people about this

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and asked them about chemtrails
and weather manipulation,

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.687 align:middle line:90%
what would most people say?

00:12:05.687 --> 00:12:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I don't think they
could formulate a response

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:84%
in 10 seconds or 15 seconds,
like a man on the street.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't understand.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.335 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: They
don't understand.

00:12:12.335 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:90%
And then that's by design.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.564 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Viewers to this show,
listeners to Coast to Coast,

00:12:16.564 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:90%
they understand.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: They will.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:90%
They're open.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:90%
They're curious.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.745 align:middle line:90%
They're investigative.

00:12:20.745 --> 00:12:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And that was something that
I couldn't stop doing, once I

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:84%
began going down
this rabbit hole,

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:90%
is there were so many offshoots.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like holy cow, look
at all that's happening here.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.210 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of
the last century,

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:84%
global warming was
a desired outcome.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.910 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to warm the planet
so they could melt the poles

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.220 align:middle line:90%
and go exploring.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.935 align:middle line:84%
Again, exploitation of
the physical resources

00:12:42.935 --> 00:12:43.560 align:middle line:90%
of this planet.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
about also go blaming.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Truly.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to go
back to the guy I talked

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:84%
with last night that was an
NCAR researcher-- National

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Centers for Atmosphere Research.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And they had these guys chasing
CO2, chasing gases, and trying

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.670 align:middle line:84%
to convince us
that our breath is

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.630 align:middle line:84%
what's changing
the climate system.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.750 align:middle line:84%
When, indeed, the powers
that be are laughing--

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.786 align:middle line:84%
laughing and saying,
ha-ha, look at them.

00:13:09.786 --> 00:13:11.160 align:middle line:84%
They research,
they get millions,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and the Black Ops get
trillions of dollars.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And what's curious
is this guy says,

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't look at
clouds that much.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't look at cloud physics.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.915 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
I'm interested in.

00:13:19.915 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think well,
that's too bad,

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.300 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
the answers are

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.633 align:middle line:90%
to what is happening in the sky.

00:13:24.633 --> 00:13:28.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I grabbed my camera--

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trusty digital.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Best tool.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:30.686 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:13:30.686 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Best tool.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And I went through lots
of pictures and videos

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.422 align:middle line:84%
that I'd shot just within
the last two weeks.

00:13:37.422 --> 00:13:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it bizarre?

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It is bizarre.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the discussion,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
he's like, you know, we don't
know about anything of this.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.030 align:middle line:90%
We haven't been told.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.600 align:middle line:90%
We haven't been briefed.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, these guys, our
National Weather Service,

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.414 align:middle line:84%
our Centers for Atmospheric
Research are out chasing gas.

00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they see things
like this, what do they say?

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Are they in shock?

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.806 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: They're
curious, intrigued,

00:13:58.806 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:90%
and then the shock sets in.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
know or do they admit

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:84%
there's something
strange going on?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Or do they say oh,
this is all natural?

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:07.866 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No, no, no.

00:14:07.866 --> 00:14:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely they admit
something strange is going on.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
need something to blame.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why global warming,
because the planet

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.840 align:middle line:90%
quit warming in '97.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.140 align:middle line:84%
We have localized hot
spots, but as a whole,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.195 align:middle line:84%
at the two meter
level, we are cooling.

00:14:20.195 --> 00:14:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's as a result
of the changes--

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want you to know that.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.583 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:14:23.583 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Because then they can't
tax us for our exhaust,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:90%
our breath, our CO2.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And then that money
gives the money system

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:84%
another way to rehypoallocate,
to spend, to borrow,

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:90%
to go further into debt.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And Ireland wants to charge
their residents like $25 a ton

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.129 align:middle line:90%
for each CO2 that they--

00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this all
about money, Scottie--

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.685 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in your opinion?

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That is the
god, the green god.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:90%
That's the money.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And we've got companies--
Boeing, Airbus, Learjet,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Gulfstream, Cessna--
all making planes.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
sitting at the trough

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:84%
of the military-industrial
complex.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So there is reward
for them to be silent.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's a great reward.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It will end.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's going to
be the planet that ends it.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:90%
She will step up.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
This being that we live
on, this being that

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.450 align:middle line:84%
supports and sustains in
every molecule we have is her.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:90%
And will say enough.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Enough.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Enough.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.206 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
things that are happening.

00:15:19.206 --> 00:15:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're
manipulated or not,

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.400 align:middle line:84%
things are happening
on this planet.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Indeed.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
happening rapidly.

00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing extreme
weather patterns every year,

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:84%
whether it's extreme
cold, or extreme hot,

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.830 align:middle line:84%
or extreme droughts,
or extreme wetness.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yup.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All of that, is
that a planet damaging thing?

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.604 align:middle line:84%
I mean these extremes-- we don't
have anything normal anymore.

00:15:44.604 --> 00:15:45.895 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: In my opinion it is.

00:15:45.895 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:90%
It is planet damaging.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And it is a way-- If you
want to go big picture,

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.147 align:middle line:84%
I think there's an
agenda to reduce

00:15:54.147 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:84%
the population of the
humans on this planet.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, some
people have said

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:84%
they would like to get
these seven billion people

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
on this planet down
to 500 million.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: And it may be 5,000.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.905 align:middle line:84%
There may be a massive,
massive bottleneck.

00:16:05.905 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As long as
they're the 5,000, right?

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Truly.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.196 align:middle line:84%
There's interesting
information that we may go--

00:16:12.196 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty low.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: --a
change in the sun.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
That something
happens significantly

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
with the sun to
greatly impact life

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.990 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of this planet.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we control it?

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I don't believe so.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:24.837 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we should want to.

00:16:24.837 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
they know something

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:90%
and they're not telling us?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:28.779 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Why else would they be building
all of these underground bases.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think is going on?

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think the
sun's going to change.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.918 align:middle line:84%
I think the sun is
going to change.

00:16:35.918 --> 00:16:37.980 align:middle line:84%
We'll go from a yellow
star to a blue star.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.049 align:middle line:90%
And in that process--

00:16:39.049 --> 00:16:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In our lifetime?

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.215 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: In our lifetime.

00:16:41.215 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I think it is-- It wasn't
a 2012 event, obviously.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain what a
yellow star to a blue star is.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: More
ultraviolet radiation.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:90%
A higher energy.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is going to take
a reworking of the genetics

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:55.730 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So that may be why that there
are all these morgellons,

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.130 align:middle line:84%
these nanofarms, these
nanotechnologies that's

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:84%
raining out on us,
and cell tissue

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:84%
samples that just about
every being could be taken

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:84%
from this planet
will show evidence

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:90%
of an uptake of this technology.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.210 align:middle line:84%
But to what end is still a
little bit curious to me.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think there is an
agenda to-- obviously,

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
we've broken the food
chain in the Pacific.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.536 align:middle line:84%
The Gulf of Mexico
is not healthy.

00:17:23.536 --> 00:17:24.619 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oceans are dying.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Oceans are dying.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And how many billions
rely on those oceans

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:90%
to feed themselves?

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:90%
It is many.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and how
about the fish in the sea

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that rely on the plankton
and other things to survive.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So if they all start
going like dominoes,

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:90%
we're in the dominoes.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:90%
We're part of it.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So I think
the way out of this

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:84%
for us is a union of
thought, is a focused intent,

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that there
is help, whether it's

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.670 align:middle line:84%
from the spirit realm
or off this planet.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:58.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean humanity is special.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have that
kind of time, though, Scott?

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yes, we do.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Time is an illusion.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.770 align:middle line:90%
Time is not real.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean it feels real,
but it can be changed.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.818 align:middle line:84%
And we radiocarbon date
things and say oh, it's

00:18:12.818 --> 00:18:13.776 align:middle line:90%
four billion years old.

00:18:13.776 --> 00:18:14.484 align:middle line:90%
But it's curious.

00:18:14.484 --> 00:18:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Time is different the
closer you get to the sun.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Time-- the rate of
time changes as you

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.020 align:middle line:90%
vary your distance from the sun.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:90%
So what is four billion?

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Is it really four
billion years, or is it

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.844 align:middle line:84%
just reworked in the
twinkling of an eye.

00:18:28.844 --> 00:18:30.635 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
we have to be open to.

00:18:30.635 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That it could
happen like that.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Truly.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:32.445 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.486 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I'm convinced
one day we'll wake up

00:18:34.486 --> 00:18:37.880 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and we'll get hit
by an asteroid, just like that.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And it's not
probably far off, either.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because most
astronomers will tell you,

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.346 align:middle line:84%
we don't even know what's out
there until we see it going by.

00:18:46.346 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Exactly.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa!

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:90%
The sun has been active lately.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Sunspots are getting bigger.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.679 align:middle line:84%
If we get hit with a major
ex-flare, major ex-flare--

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:00.095 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: The
proper orientation.

00:19:00.095 --> 00:19:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 10, 20, 30.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:01.696 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:19:01.696 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's right at
us, what happens to that grid?

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It goes down.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:90%
It goes down.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.097 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:19:08.097 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fried.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:09.846 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's fried.

00:19:09.846 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And we've had national
exercises, these grid down

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.480 align:middle line:84%
exercises that happened
recently, last fall.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So they always telegraph
what's going to happen ahead

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
of time, whether it's in movies,
whether it's in exercises.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
What has been curious
is that exercises

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.300 align:middle line:84%
that are well advertised
often coincide

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.947 align:middle line:84%
with some significant
real world event.

00:19:28.947 --> 00:19:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Real event.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Real event.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like that day.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Truly.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Like under the cover--

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What great timing, huh?

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Please.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.380 align:middle line:84%
All the forces are
there and engaged.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's why a lot
of us feel a little uneasy.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:90%
A little bit on edge.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And that we really can't push
this planet and this mode

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.610 align:middle line:90%
of civilization a lot further.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:84%
We've nearly exhausted
our natural resources.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what we're
doing to get natural gas

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.040 align:middle line:84%
now is obscene, utterly
obscene to the planet.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not a
fracking fan, are you?

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think it'll be
a big mistake in hindsight.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:84%
There's technology that we can
use that will be free energy,

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and there's no need to blow all
these clay seals between water

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and petroleum products, and
pull it out of the ground.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:90%
So we can drive?

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:90%
That's insane.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.462 align:middle line:90%
It's utterly insane.

00:20:16.462 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
some, Scott, who

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.010 align:middle line:84%
say that we are in the beginning
stages of a mini ice age.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I agree.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
the sun is showing us.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Is that it is-- I mean the solar
cycle was big in 2000, 2001.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.970 align:middle line:84%
This last one has
been significantly

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:32.480 align:middle line:90%
lower than expected.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got the
solar scientists going,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.672 align:middle line:90%
oh, something's changed.

00:20:35.672 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it doesn't
mean-- and correct me--

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:84%
but an ice age
doesn't mean you don't

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.687 align:middle line:90%
get warm weather in the summer.

00:20:41.687 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But your winters are
longer, and longer, and longer.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.679 align:middle line:84%
So snow that would normally
melt, doesn't melt.

00:20:49.679 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Doesn't.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It just stays.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Something
else that would change

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.510 align:middle line:84%
would be the quantity
of water vapor

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere
would be reduced,

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:84%
because as we
re-glaciate the poles,

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:84%
we'll have less surface
area of the ocean

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:90%
available to evaporate.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Ocean temperatures will also be
correspondingly cooler-- less

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.520 align:middle line:90%
evaporation.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So what we'll see is
glaciation at the tops.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
There will be zones around
that which will be green.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And then vast, vast portions of
the planet which will be dry.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Not too dissimilar to Mars.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.150 align:middle line:90%
But it's a temporary phase.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take the opposite
effect of where you're headed,

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and the manipulation
is intent is

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:84%
to make things better
for us, not worse.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't believe that,
but is it possible?

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm
here with you today,

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:84%
is because I believe that we
can have public oversight.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.759 align:middle line:84%
It is our money being
spent to do this.

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:43.550 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have a
fiat dollar system that

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
had to use true national
physical treasury

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.676 align:middle line:84%
to do with this--
gold, silver, land--

00:21:48.676 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't have
gotten off the ground.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.383 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't have happened.

00:21:51.383 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It's only because we have
this funny money that we

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:90%
can pull off these huge games.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think when we get enough
public awareness correctly

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
understanding what's going on,
that we can get it changed.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:90%
We truly can.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:90%
I believe that's possible.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm a huge
believer, a huge believer

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.360 align:middle line:90%
in a divine presence here.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Me too.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something was smart
enough to develop things.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
But what has been, for me,
the most unbelievable thought

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
is a planet, the
Gaiam theory of Gaia.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:84%
This planet that has the ability
to live, it's alive, it's

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.530 align:middle line:90%
an organism.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Indeed.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would have thought
that trees, and shrubbery,

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and grass, and all these things
that need to live on water,

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:84%
would then make it rain so
that all those things would

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.040 align:middle line:90%
have those elements?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.845 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant.

00:22:49.845 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It is brilliant.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody designed it.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:90%
This didn't happen by accident.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I agree.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:84%
We have this discussion
that it's either

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.264 align:middle line:90%
creationism or evolution.

00:23:01.264 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not both?

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Things are
created so they can evolve.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: This is why we--

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And let it go.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.096 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: This is
why we have children,

00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:11.300 align:middle line:84%
so they can evolve
and improve us.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.440 align:middle line:84%
This is why we start
a project like Gaiam.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Why you do your show.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:84%
We create something so we
can evolve, so we can change.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
bring-- there's a place,

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's not far off, where
science and spirit will merge.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.770 align:middle line:90%
That oneness will happen.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.560 align:middle line:84%
The dogma and doctrine
will fall away

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:84%
because at some point
in the near future,

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.940 align:middle line:90%
it simply won't make sense.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.834 align:middle line:90%
It won't pass rational thought.

00:23:35.834 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:84%
There won't be a historical
precedence for it.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:90%
It just won't make sense.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be looking for a
new foundation, a new footing.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And science and spirit
will have this oneness,

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and then humanity will finally
graduate from our childhood,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and we can join those
in the stars, who

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.040 align:middle line:84%
are just waiting
for us to say, hey!

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm present!

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm here!

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm available!

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Rather than oh,
they don't exist.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:23:59.295 align:middle line:90%
There is no god.

00:23:59.295 --> 00:24:00.336 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing up there.

00:24:00.336 --> 00:24:02.135 align:middle line:84%
It's just us and that's
all there is to it.

00:24:02.135 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:90%
You know, we're not isolated.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:04.900 align:middle line:90%
But yet we are.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's only because we've
chosen to isolate ourselves.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have had
severe tornadoes recently.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.564 align:middle line:90%
Are they manipulated?

00:24:12.564 --> 00:24:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Everything.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.271 align:middle line:90%
Everything, George.

00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I have been on tornado chases
and seen Chinook helicopters

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.390 align:middle line:84%
off in the distance.
[MOTOR SOUND]

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.682 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tornado on the ground.

00:24:21.682 --> 00:24:22.348 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:24:22.348 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:90%
They're watching.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's real
time surveillance

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:24.840 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I think if you
wanted to put down

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.870 align:middle line:84%
a tornado in Moore,
Oklahoma, because it

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.440 align:middle line:90%
happens more often there--

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.398 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does, yeah.

00:24:31.398 --> 00:24:34.844 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: --that you could
put a red target on it,

00:24:34.844 --> 00:24:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and they could hit
it within two blocks.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think
they're really--

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
generate the vortex.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:40.836 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Easily.

00:24:40.836 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Easily.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.916 align:middle line:84%
I mean the natural
energy is that spiral.

00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
some of these tornadoes

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:84%
are experiments, and saying
let's see what we can create,

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:90%
and how big can we get it?

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.704 align:middle line:90%
Can we turn it into an F5?

00:24:52.704 --> 00:24:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.703 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of that
experimentation happened

00:24:55.703 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:90%
in the '70s and '80s.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Wichita Falls, Texas in '79.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.992 align:middle line:90%
The snow in Miami in '77.

00:25:01.992 --> 00:25:03.450 align:middle line:84%
That's when the
experimentation was

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.100 align:middle line:90%
happening in the '70s and '80s.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they got better
and better and better.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I've got pictures of
just west of here,

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Walden, Colorado in
1987, winter of '87.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.287 align:middle line:84%
These massive tsunami
waves rolling south--

00:25:16.287 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.286 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: --across
the mountains.

00:25:18.286 --> 00:25:19.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean massive.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Without chemtrails.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.960 align:middle line:84%
They're remotely trying to
introduce the right waves

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and resonance in the atmosphere
to get the desired effect.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So now that they've got
1,000 or more planes here

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
in the Americas
doing this program,

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:84%
they can finely tune
these waves so it

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:84%
doesn't look so
freakin' out of normal.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:42.124 align:middle line:84%
And so it looks like it could
be plausibly natural weather.

00:25:42.124 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they need to do is

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.190 align:middle line:84%
keep turning up the heat
little bit by little bit

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:84%
by little bit,
without us recognizing

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:90%
that we're in trouble.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Biggest hurricane
ever this past year.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.387 align:middle line:84%
Largest, strongest wind speed,
what, 235 miles an hour.

00:25:56.387 --> 00:25:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: And previous--

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one that
hit the Philippines?

00:25:58.410 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yes.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.280 align:middle line:84%
The previous record
wind speed was

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:84%
out of Mount Washington
at 231 miles per hour back

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:90%
in the 1930s, I believe.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's blown away
with a hurricane,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and blown away by like
70, 80 miles an hour.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Broke the previous record.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:90%
That is so in your face.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you see it?

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Do you recognize
what's going on?

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
That's where we are, and
they're trying to say, wake up!

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.199 align:middle line:90%
Wake up!

00:26:22.199 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big stuff.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at our last photo.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is this?

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: This was 2006, and it
was the edge of a thunderstorm.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
are three chemtrails.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
disturbances or distortions

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:84%
or rips in the trails,
and we've marked those.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's how the
powders drip off the bottom,

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:42.687 align:middle line:90%
or are drawn off the top.

00:26:42.687 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those yellow
marks are yours.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Those yellow marks are mine.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom mark,
you can see where

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:84%
the trail looks
like it's pregnant.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.140 align:middle line:90%
It's got a bulge off the side.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So there's some resonance wave
that is very small in scale,

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.020 align:middle line:84%
likely less than two
miles in diameter,

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:84%
that is pushing those powders,
pushing those aerosols off

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:90%
to one side.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And then it returns
back to the zero line.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's just this is what
they're up there to do,

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.410 align:middle line:84%
is to measure and to see how
these electrical or orgon

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:90%
influences are behaving.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.367 align:middle line:84%
And they, in turn,
entrain the atmosphere.

00:27:16.367 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great promo for a
channel four in whatever city

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:19.402 align:middle line:90%
that might be.

00:27:19.402 --> 00:27:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Truly.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:84%
When hurricane, I
believe it was Wilma,

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.300 align:middle line:84%
was coming to shore in South
Florida, in the eye of Wilma

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.870 align:middle line:84%
was the number two, the
alphanumeric number two.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that time, a
category two hurricane just

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.100 align:middle line:90%
prior to landfall.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:84%
The National Weather Service out
of Tampa caught the number two,

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and then the local
station down in Fort Myers

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:84%
caught the number two in
the middle of that eye.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:45.770 align:middle line:90%
They're that good.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I have seen faces drawn in
the tops of storms-- little

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.610 align:middle line:90%
smiley faces.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:54.150 align:middle line:84%
They are that bold, that
arrogant, yet that creative

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.840 align:middle line:90%
in doing what they're doing.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:90%
The question is do you see it?

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, maybe people
are beginning to see it.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.479 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I believe so.

00:28:03.479 --> 00:28:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Programs like this.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Where does this all take us?

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Where do we end up
5, 10 years from now?

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: For me,
if there's a way

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to blow the cover off the
military-industrial complex,

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.565 align:middle line:84%
and their true long-term
agenda for mankind,

00:28:18.565 --> 00:28:20.980 align:middle line:90%
it is the weather manipulation.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the number
of victims that

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.420 align:middle line:84%
have been subjected
to this equals

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.775 align:middle line:90%
the population on the planet.

00:28:26.775 --> 00:28:28.850 align:middle line:90%
It is every one of us.

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:84%
We have had to endure personal
loss, financial loss, loss

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.591 align:middle line:90%
of life, loss.

00:28:34.591 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
do know what they

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:90%
will say if caught and revealed.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were trying
to change the weather

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.810 align:middle line:84%
to make things
happen for people.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So plants would grow, and
droughts would go away.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
going to say.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And then we'll do
forensics on the last 40 years

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:52.615 align:middle line:90%
and say, that's a lie.

00:28:52.615 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not working.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: That's a lie.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.414 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good attempt,
but you failed completely.

00:28:56.414 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think
awareness is imminent.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And being able to talk to these
researchers and just show them,

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.740 align:middle line:84%
if I had had somebody
10 years ago just point

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.500 align:middle line:84%
out these things
to me, I would have

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:90%
begun looking at the sky sooner.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.974 align:middle line:84%
Without a bias that, oh,
that's just an air wave.

00:29:15.974 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:84%
The plane is just doing
what it's going to do.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's planes investigating
anomalies, drawn out

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.160 align:middle line:90%
by previous trails.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.640 align:middle line:90%
That was the clincher for me.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If Scott
Stevens 10 years ago

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:31.660 align:middle line:84%
had seen Scott Stevens today
on "Beyond Belief" talking

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.130 align:middle line:84%
about this, what would
that of Scott Stevens

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:90%
said 10 years ago?

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:90%
This guy's nuts?

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Dude, you've got balls for
getting out there and talking

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.645 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:29:43.645 --> 00:29:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody's got to.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:45.895 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Somebody has to.

00:29:45.895 --> 00:29:47.290 align:middle line:90%
And I really, really--

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People want
more information on you,

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:49.850 align:middle line:90%
where do they find you?

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.641 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Weatherwars.info
is the big one.

00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And then dealing with detox
and keeping everything healthy,

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.070 align:middle line:90%
it's Bluewateralchemy.com.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, very good.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Scottie, thank you.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Thank you.

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:58.127 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:29:58.127 --> 00:29:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always a pleasure.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:59.880 align:middle line:90%
Keep watching the skies for us.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I'll keep
looking up, George.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yup.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the only way
we're going to catch this.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Just keep looking up.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:22.934 align:middle line:90%
