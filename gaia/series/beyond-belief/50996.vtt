00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.830 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.455 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:13.640 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.639 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.350 align:middle line:10%
It's called, of
course, the secret war.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:10%
It has to do with shadow
people, and as you

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.790 align:middle line:10%
know, listening to
"Coast to Coast AM"

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:10%
over all these
many years, we have

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:10%
talked a lot about
shadow people.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:10%
Heidi Hollis is an expert
about these entities.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.984 align:middle line:84%
Heidi, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:44.984 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIDI HOLLIS: I am so
ecstatic to be here, George.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.564 align:middle line:90%
You have no idea.

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Shadow
people-- for a lot

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:84%
of people who may not be aware
of what these things are,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:90%
give us kind of your version.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: I would describe
them as a very dark mass that

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.170 align:middle line:90%
sometimes takes different forms.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
They could come in a form that I
call head and shoulder shadows.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.670 align:middle line:84%
They're very large,
sometimes 10 feet tall.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:10%
Also, shadow cats,
shadow rodents,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:10%
shadow streaks-- I mean, just
any variety of dark mass.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And it gives off a different
vibe than a ghost would.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.257 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very negative
vibe that people describe

00:01:21.257 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
when they're in the
presence of these.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you can
see the very red eyes

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:84%
when they lean a little
bit closer to you.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So they have a very
intimidating sense.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And you feel that
your soul is at risk

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:90%
when you're in their presence.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:10%
So it's nothing to
be taken lightly.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.450 align:middle line:10%
And I used to, at one
point, get reports

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:10%
from paranormal investigators
who were like, oh, Heidi, these

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:10%
are just the shadows of ghosts.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.082 align:middle line:10%
Honey, you just wait
till you see one.

00:01:48.082 --> 00:01:48.665 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:50.248 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: [LAUGHS]
Then you will know.

00:01:50.248 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they evil?

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.896 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Oh,
they're beyond evil.

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
They truly are as negative
as you can imagine.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's their mission?

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.280 align:middle line:90%
What's their goal?

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: You
know, individually,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.155 align:middle line:84%
when people report having
these experiences--

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they do.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all over the place.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: It is.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:90%
It's all over.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:90%
And, gosh, what a shock that is.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:84%
But as a mission, they really
enjoy scaring the life out

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:90%
of a person.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:90%
I toned that down.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
The shit. [LAUGHS]
Because these things,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.990 align:middle line:84%
they like to feed off
from a person's fear.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about, oh,
they're just there lurking.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:90%
They do have a goal.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
They do have a goal to try to
get to you at a sense where you

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:84%
truly cannot handle the
fear that you've got.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because a lot
of people have written to me

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.394 align:middle line:84%
and told me the moment
that they just kind of let

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
go-- like they feel like
they can't take it anymore.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.630 align:middle line:84%
When they let go,
it leaves. [LAUGHS]

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's as if it's had its fill.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've done
as much as they could.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a
disturbing trend.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And I feel terrible
about what it

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:84%
is that people are
going through because it

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:90%
is an individual war.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:84%
It's their own secret
war that's going on.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's to an extent where,
how do you go home at night?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.870 align:middle line:90%
You do your regular routine.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.460 align:middle line:90%
You go to bed or whatever.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you have something
from another dimension

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.352 align:middle line:84%
attack you, scare
the life out of you,

00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
supposed to go back

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:84%
to work and act like
nothing happened.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, leave me alone.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.624 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:26.624 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like your whole reality
has just been shaken up.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:90%
And people don't get it.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
They don't get it
on a regular basis

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:90%
to know this is a real thing.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.330 align:middle line:84%
They don't have many
people to relate to.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the big
tragedy in a lot of this.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people
see objects out

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
of the corner of
their eye-- they

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.890 align:middle line:84%
see a whoosh of an obvious
shadow something, whatever

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.567 align:middle line:84%
it might be-- is that what
we're talking about, too?

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: You know, if you
don't have a low flying

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
bat in your place,
and you know this,

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and you saw a black
thing go past you,

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:90%
that's a shadow streak.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:84%
That is something that
I would definitely

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
contend to be related
to these beings.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's just
them moving rather quickly.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:84%
When they're
stationary, they look

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.660 align:middle line:90%
like a shadow cloud of sorts.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's odd because when
these shadow clouds form

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:84%
in like a corner, they
get these like tentacles

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.767 align:middle line:84%
that the kind of sprawl
out from the corner.

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it just gives me chills
every time I think about it.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I get so
many reports of that.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually the most
common type of shadow being

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:84%
that I saw myself, shadow
spiders is what I call them.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ew.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.655 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:04:44.655 --> 00:04:45.812 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really, any woman--

00:04:45.812 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
like real spiders.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.103 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Thank you.

00:04:48.103 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, George.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.366 align:middle line:84%
I know that we can
relate on this.

00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because shadow
spiders are disgusting.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
No, no, George. [LAUGHS] I'm
about to take my shoe off.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.825 align:middle line:90%
No. [LAUGHS] But it's like--

00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smack.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah, yeah, right.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like for any
woman, any guy even--

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you see a
spider the size of your hand,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are
you supposed to do?

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And these things, for me,
they look very real, actually,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:90%
when I was experiencing them.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's terrifying to
see something so large

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and then to be like--
this is my scenario,

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:84%
how I would usually wake
up to these lovely things.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.312 align:middle line:90%
Something would hit my bed.

00:05:32.312 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't know--

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could feel it?

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: I could feel it.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.403 align:middle line:90%
It would hit my bed.

00:05:35.403 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And it would start
walking up the bed.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And with every step, it
would move my blanket.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.886 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, you know, wow.

00:05:41.886 --> 00:05:42.926 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A shadow spider.

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: A shadows spider.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.369 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like lift the
blanket up underneath it?

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: No.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's on
top and it's walking.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's moving with every
step that it's taking.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I don't even know
what kind of shoe I could get.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.280 align:middle line:90%
But I would run and try to--

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.834 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to say,
you can't kill a shadow.

00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: But I didn't know
what I was dealing with.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, either there's
a man-eating spider

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
in my bedroom, or I'm
like hallucinating.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
I was experiencing.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw one that
took up the whole ceiling

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:90%
of my bedroom once.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:90%
And I was just like, I'm dead.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.863 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:06:15.863 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh, it was--

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ready to fall on you.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Oh, come
on. [LAUGHS] No.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like the scene
from the Hobbit, OK?

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.886 align:middle line:90%
Part Two.

00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows what
I'm talking about.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I was ready to
just run. [LAUGHS]

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
I was up against.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And to have that
sense of horror,

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and it's so strange,
because a lot of people,

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
they get paralyzed with the
fear of seeing these things.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.255 align:middle line:90%
I was very active, George.

00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:45.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I was very active.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
blame people for being

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:84%
petrified when they
see these things.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yes.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
understand-- and initially

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:84%
when I was getting these reports
of people being paralyzed,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
unable to function,
and I'm like,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.999 align:middle line:84%
gosh, it sounds a lot
like alien abductions.

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:90%
They're just like--

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.135 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:07:02.135 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:90%
And it was odd.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:90%
It was really odd.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
mentioned earlier

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:84%
that these creatures might be
coming from other dimensions.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:90%
I've long suspected that.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:84%
I've long suspected
that there could

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
be some kind of a
warp that's uneven.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:90%
And somehow they filter through.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.680 align:middle line:90%
And they come in that way.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not sure
they're coming at will.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.830 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Well, I
think that there's

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.770 align:middle line:84%
an interesting thing that's
going on in regard to that.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my understanding in
regard to the shadow people

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:90%
comes from an alien source.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a little odd.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a little different.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But this alien
source had indicated

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.170 align:middle line:84%
to myself and my
college roommate

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.230 align:middle line:84%
that if you're in a
room, close your eyes,

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:90%
and try to imagine the room.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.591 align:middle line:84%
Any part of the room that
you can't really get a good--

00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Feel for.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah, or
image in your mind

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.112 align:middle line:84%
of what it looks like,
that's a doorway.

00:08:02.112 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
That's a doorway,
that's a doorway,

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
they come through.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And these beings, their goal is
to essentially get at everybody

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So they truly are on
their own type of mission

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:84%
where they're trying to
gain access to people.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And every opportunity
that they can, they will.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that was
indicated to me when

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:84%
it comes to these
beings-- negative beings

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:84%
in general, negative
aliens, shadow people--

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:84%
over the tops of
everybody's head,

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:84%
there's essentially
like a tunnel.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
And it can be seen
at a distance by

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:84%
these different interdimensional
beings, these beings that

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
could go in and out of
our view, essentially.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.710 align:middle line:90%
So they can see it.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And they could go over
the top and essentially

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.290 align:middle line:84%
funnel straight down
to where you are.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:54.921 align:middle line:84%
And this is the tunnel that you
see at the end of your life.

00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Like a near death
experience, people

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:84%
describe seeing a tunnel
with a light at the end.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And these things are able to
access that and access you

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:90%
at any point.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's like when people say,
oh, a person is too open.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, if your tunnel is
open, put a blocker on it

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:84%
so they can't just
funnel down to you.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:90%
That is important.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:84%
But these beings are
showing up a lot more

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.477 align:middle line:84%
because their time
is running short.

00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
coming on their own?

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Or are we summoning them up?

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh, I think both.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I think there's too many people
that are just really digging

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:84%
this ghost hunting type thing,
going out into the graveyards

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and calling things
into themselves.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:90%
And these things love that.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:90%
They love the negative.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:90%
They love anything like that.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's how they feed.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: They do.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:84%
They feed right off
from these people.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.022 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, some people
are welcoming them.

00:09:47.022 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're having a lot
of problems with them.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.414 align:middle line:84%
And they're wondering,
gee, what is going on?

00:09:51.414 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I get a
letter from them.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.155 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like, you
know, stop going out

00:09:55.155 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:90%
to the graveyard, OK?

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Just quit.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had an
episode years ago.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh, really?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't think I'm nuts.

00:10:02.355 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: It's just
between me and you.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm driving
someone at night.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And I see, scurrying
across the road--

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.837 align:middle line:84%
you know what an
armadillo looks like?

00:10:13.837 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yes.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This was like that,
except it's had antenna.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was a whole line of
these little shadow rodents.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh, wow.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It must have been
about eight to 10 of them,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:84%
small, pointy little nose,
all shadows, antenna.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
right across the road.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:84%
As I drove, I felt like I was
going to run right over them,

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.094 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know if they
were real or what for a while.

00:10:39.094 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Right.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What the
heck were they?

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.004 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: You know what?

00:10:42.004 --> 00:10:44.337 align:middle line:84%
When I went on you show and
you told me about the shadow

00:10:44.337 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:84%
rodents, that was the first
that I had heard of them.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But I have heard of low
clouds and things like that.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.065 align:middle line:84%
But something so distinctive
as what you described

00:10:53.065 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:84%
was, you know, I had not
heard of prior to that point.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.981 align:middle line:84%
But then I had another--
not a whole lot,

00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:84%
but a couple other witnesses
come forward describing--

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've
seen similar things.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yes.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.506 align:middle line:84%
And they are just another
form that they take.

00:11:05.506 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
They could take any
form that they want.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought
I was hallucinating.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:84%
But they just looked too real,
too organized, too disciplined.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
They were in a line,
totally unaware of me,

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and just doing
their thing, which

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.640 align:middle line:84%
brings up an
interesting question.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.412 align:middle line:84%
Are they sometimes
unaware of us?

00:11:24.412 --> 00:11:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: I think
sometimes they're

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:middle line:84%
unaware that we're
paying attention.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I think that they don't
always like to be caught.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.270 align:middle line:84%
My very first encounter
with one of them

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.890 align:middle line:84%
actually involved one that was
very, very upset that I saw it.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Broad daylight,
walking with my friend,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
what I was looking at.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.870 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the head and
shoulders shadow beings.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And this thing was ducking
behind trees and bushes

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.829 align:middle line:84%
and just moving along the
path in broad daylight.

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doing its thing.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Doing its thing,
followed us where we're going,

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:90%
followed us on the way back.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.620 align:middle line:84%
By the time we reach my
friend's home, I'm like, look,

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I'm seeing
here, but I saw this thing.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And I just drew the
head and shoulders,

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.965 align:middle line:84%
which looks almost like a
man with its head directly

00:12:08.965 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:90%
connected to its shoulders.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.025 align:middle line:84%
I know guys like that, but
this is something different.

00:12:13.025 --> 00:12:13.680 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: And I think my
friend is going to laugh at me,

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:90%
like, Oh, Heidi, come on, what?

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And takes one look at the
drawing and is just like, oh,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:90%
him again.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.936 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I don't know who he is.

00:12:23.936 --> 00:12:25.310 align:middle line:84%
He's been following
me for years.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: It was like, hey,
Dad, that thing is back.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:90%
He's like, oh, is he?

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.059 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, [GASPS] And
now, right after that, I

00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
had to go upstairs
to grab something,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:90%
and it confronted me.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it was trying to
block my way out of the room

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:90%
that I was in.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even
know how to describe

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
what that kind of
horror feels like.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.632 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew if I ran,
it was going to get me.

00:12:49.632 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
If I swung at it, it
was going to get me,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
like it was going to
feed upon that fear.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what told me that.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.750 align:middle line:90%
It was in me to know.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like it wanted
to rip my throat out.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's such
a strange thing.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they ever
hurt people physically?

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: I have
actually received

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:84%
reports of people who have
been attacked to the point

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
that they thought they
were going to die.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:84%
One of their number one favorite
things that they like to do:

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:90%
jump on a person and choke them.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, gosh,
what is one of the worst ways

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:90%
to die?

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Slowly choking.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So they're truly trying to
get that out of a person,

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:90%
is how I feel.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But you know,
there's another level

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.235 align:middle line:84%
that goes with what
they do, though, too.

00:13:33.235 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Because for the people that
they've been successful

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
in, perhaps, killing,
how would we know?

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.750 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How would we know?

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, people
die in their sleep.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.848 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: All the time.

00:13:41.848 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know it's
not some kind of shadow entity

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.527 align:middle line:84%
that has killed them or scared
the living daylights out

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
of them that they died of a
heart attack in their sleep?

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Exactly.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
suspected that.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.530 align:middle line:84%
What causes a person
to pass in their sleep?

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And some entity comes.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Or whatever they
see is so horrible.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.632 align:middle line:84%
You know, [CHOKING NOISE]
And they're gone.

00:14:04.632 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Right, right.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a terrible, terrible
thing that's going on.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
how do we-- essentially,

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.650 align:middle line:84%
why is it so
important to get rid

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.370 align:middle line:84%
of these things is what I always
try to get at with people.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're constantly
being harassed by these things,

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:84%
they're just a little bit
too close for comfort.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's a matter of
protecting your soul.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Because people have
been seeing things.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're going down
the end of their tunnel,

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:90%
and there's an alien.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.362 align:middle line:84%
These beings, if
they're so close to you,

00:14:37.362 --> 00:14:40.600 align:middle line:84%
they might just be waiting at
the end of your tunnel for you

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:90%
to get over there.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend to people
don't entertain these things.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.655 align:middle line:84%
I've had so many people write me
ever since I went in your show

00:14:50.655 --> 00:14:51.960 align:middle line:90%
in '02, George.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That does it.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: What is the deal?

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:90%
You have magic or something.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But [LAUGHS] I went
on your show in '02.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.084 align:middle line:90%
I wrote this book in '97.

00:15:01.084 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It took me two
months to write it,

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle line:84%
four years to get it published
because publishers are like,

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.240 align:middle line:84%
very interesting story, but
never heard of this phenomenon.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.260 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't talk about it.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:10%
I was told never to talk about
it until the book was out.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.029 align:middle line:10%
So when they got a hold of
the book, I was just getting

00:15:19.029 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:10%
turned downs, turn downs.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.611 align:middle line:10%
And then I had promises they'd
publish, and then they didn't.

00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:10%
But I finally just went
and got it published,

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:10%
went on your show.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know, didn't have
the slightest inkling,

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:10%
how people would take
it-- none at all.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.857 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like, well,
George, shadow people.

00:15:33.857 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Shadow people?

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, shadow people.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.715 align:middle line:10%
It's just like I have
been inundated ever since.

00:15:38.715 --> 00:15:39.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It hasn't stopped.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.570 align:middle line:10%
>>HOLLIS: Thousands-- I
have thousands of reports.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it just does not stop.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was almost upset at how
much was going on already.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that others
had experienced this.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And it hurt me,
because the information

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:84%
that I gathered on
the topic was when

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:84%
it starts to expand
to such an extent,

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
the end is kind of near for
an all-out battle of all

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:84%
battles-- I mean, good and
evil, the whole shebang.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:84%
That was in '02, so
it hit me hard then.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.849 align:middle line:84%
And it's been just
getting worse.

00:16:20.849 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:10%
And it's just been
getting worse and worse.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:10%
And I'm like, I don't know how
to help people more than-- how

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:10%
do you fight the dark
but with the light?

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- I think
it was on your show,

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:90%
you said this to me.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
When I came out
with my Jesus book--

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.190 align:middle line:84%
it's based on Jesus encounters,
called Jesus is No Joke--

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and when I came to
talk to you about it,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.257 align:middle line:84%
you're like, Heidi, are
we losing you? [LAUGHS]

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:90%
What's happening to you, Heidi?

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.468 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: [LAUGHS] I was like,
no, George, I'm still there.

00:16:52.468 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's, like, to the
point of, you know,

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I had the most darkest
things going on.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And I had actually
kind of looked away

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:90%
from my faith quite a bit.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.849 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was raised Christian.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:84%
But when you could
see a UFO clearer

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:13.367 align:middle line:84%
than you could see an
angel, it just happens.

00:17:13.367 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:90%
You look away.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of
people that happened to.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.920 align:middle line:90%
So I kind of looked away.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of went
full circle back

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.230 align:middle line:84%
when I had these encounters
that I couldn't deny,

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't going to.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm the type of
person, like, I could

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:84%
care less what people think
when it comes to this topic.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's
more important that we

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:37.620 align:middle line:84%
act as ourselves in presenting
these topics without,

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, having to speak
in a high, angelic voice

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:90%
or wear fluffy robes.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we
were kids, we would

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:84%
talk about the
boogie man, right,

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:84%
this guy that would
come out of a closet,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.110 align:middle line:90%
this dark, shadowy figure.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Might that be a shadow
person, the boogie man?

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: I think he is
a sort of a boogie man.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's more than
one, these shadow people.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
my next question.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Is there one guy
who goes everywhere?

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Or a whole group of them?

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: A whole army
of these shadow people.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I guess I'll

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.730 align:middle line:84%
have to distinguish
a little bit later

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
but having to do with something
I call the hat man shadow.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And I had to correct
myself on that.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you a little
bit more about that.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was a
phenomenon that really

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.910 align:middle line:84%
steered in a
different direction.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to the
shadow people in general,

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.320 align:middle line:84%
having to build my
faith up to push

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
those things away
was absolute key.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, me just
standing there trying

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.660 align:middle line:84%
to get a baseball bat to kill
a giant shadow spider wasn't

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle line:90%
going to cut it.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can just see you
whacking away at this thing.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:10%
>>HOLLIS: Trust me, my
college roommates are like,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.440 align:middle line:10%
what are you doing?

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, give me a second.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:10%
Because I think if I get it
this time, it will never return.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But it just kept going
on and on, and I'm like,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.120 align:middle line:90%
what is going on?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.180 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to combat
it on a different level.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know what it was
that I was personally seeing.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
a phenomenon that

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle line:84%
was going on in my shared
space with my college roommate.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And we would see
these spheres of light

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.470 align:middle line:84%
that would come in
through the windows

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and go after these
shadowy things.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.745 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, did you see that?

00:19:37.745 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like to try
to gobble them up?

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: It would
literally attack--

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a Pac-Man?

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.594 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: No, it
would literally,

00:19:42.594 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
like they would
disappear, almost

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.479 align:middle line:84%
like turning a flashlight
on in the dark.

00:19:46.479 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle line:90%
They would go away.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what is this?

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.700 align:middle line:90%
I had no clue what it was.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:84%
There was so much going on, and
it happened wherever I moved.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, so either I'm
haunted, or something else

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.950 align:middle line:90%
is going on here.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was at a level of I
was watching a secret war,

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.915 align:middle line:84%
which is why I called
my book, The Secret War.

00:20:08.915 --> 00:20:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's still ongoing.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:10.703 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yes.

00:20:10.703 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was literally the
light going after the dark.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And to get front-row
seats to that,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:84%
I even had some friends stay
over like just to watch.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Because it was so active.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just like,
everybody, pay attention.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like, something's is
going to happen at some point.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.925 align:middle line:90%
And it usually did.

00:20:27.925 --> 00:20:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
bottom line, Heidi?

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:90%
What are they after, souls?

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Are they working for the devil?

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Well,
you know, I think

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:90%
that darkness is darkness.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
People put titles
to it and try to say

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.100 align:middle line:84%
it's going this
way or the other.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
the things that

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:84%
are written of in the Bible
that talk about the devil

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.112 align:middle line:84%
could take on any
form, or darkness

00:20:52.112 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:84%
could take on any
form, it's really

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
shadow people that
are able to do that.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Call it what you may, but all
that's really important to know

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:90%
is to get rid of it.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Do not entertain it.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.136 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you get rid of it?

00:21:04.136 --> 00:21:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Building
up your faith.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
went the route that I

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:84%
did, also to share the
more spiritual journey.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:90%
I had to go full circle.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:90%
I turned away from faith.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.450 align:middle line:84%
I had to go full circle
and go back to it.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.926 align:middle line:84%
Because if I
didn't, I don't know

00:21:17.926 --> 00:21:20.020 align:middle line:84%
if I'd be able to
talk to you sanely.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.677 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
so much going on.

00:21:22.677 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And I learned to
have a sense of humor

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.650 align:middle line:84%
about it, too,
because if you sit

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.845 align:middle line:84%
there all anal on
these topics, I

00:21:27.845 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:84%
know how to clear
a room, George.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I know how to clear a room,
scare everybody to death,

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.769 align:middle line:90%
they won't sleep for weeks.

00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:90%
But then people aren't growing.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.290 align:middle line:90%
They're not learning.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
point of doing that?

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So my goal was to
find this route

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that I could relate as
I am, as silly as I am.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And just enjoy life and
acknowledge that the paranormal

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.840 align:middle line:84%
is real, too, without
getting all weird about it.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.850 align:middle line:90%
So it's finding the balance.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.320 align:middle line:84%
It's acknowledging yes,
this stuff exists, but also

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.394 align:middle line:84%
to protect your
soul and your spirit

00:21:59.394 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:90%
in the face of these things.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.815 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
just a possibility

00:22:02.815 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:84%
the shadow people may show up
at some point in your life.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:90%
It will come.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.001 align:middle line:90%
It will happen.

00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
come during moments

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:90%
of strife, moments of stress?

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: I think they create
a lot of those moments.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not just them coming
during those times.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:90%
I think they're part of it.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.440 align:middle line:84%
I've received so many emails and
heard so many stories of people

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.200 align:middle line:84%
who are like, we moved
into this new place

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and we just started
going at each other,

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:84%
just yelling and
screaming and fighting.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And then we saw
these black things

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:84%
on the side of our vision
every once in a while.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.070 align:middle line:90%
Well what is going with that?

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they got a
better look sometimes.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, this
was a common theme.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And they realized
they had a problem.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
There was an infestation
of these shadow beings.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And they needed
to get rid of it.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.040 align:middle line:84%
But you know what's
important, though, too?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who live in a
place or have been to a place

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:84%
where it's highly haunted,
they'll often find a shadow

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.375 align:middle line:90%
person is also lurking around.

00:23:00.375 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
why is that going on?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're
not ghosts, right?

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: They are not ghosts.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.253 align:middle line:90%
They are not ghosts.

00:23:05.253 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:84%
But one of their
things that they do--

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and I don't talk
about this so much,

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:84%
but they're kind of
a harborer of souls.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Why are they lingering
in a certain space?

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.543 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good souls?

00:23:18.543 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Bad souls?

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: It just
seems like they'll just

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:90%
hold on to whomever.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're usually responsible
for the ghosts or the souls

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:28.060 align:middle line:90%
that are trapped in a place.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.777 align:middle line:90%
And that's their doing.

00:23:29.777 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Were those people
experiencing shadow people

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:32.526 align:middle line:90%
during their lifetime?

00:23:32.526 --> 00:23:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.151 align:middle line:90%
And that's why they got 'em.

00:23:36.151 --> 00:23:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of friends that
are psychics and whatnot.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I never
try to knock people

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
for what they believe to
be true for themselves.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.790 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't hurt me to hear that.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.520 align:middle line:84%
But they believe, oh,
the ghosts are here

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.853 align:middle line:90%
because of this, this, and that.

00:23:48.853 --> 00:23:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, you
know, sure, maybe.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they are.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they're trapped
because something held them

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.496 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:23:55.496 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not always they
had unfinished business.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.430 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's like when
you see, oh, there's

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.970 align:middle line:84%
a cute little five-year-old
ghost running around.

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: What God do you know
would punish a five-year-old?

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I'm like, hold on.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps maybe something is
trying to look all innocent.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Because these shadow
people can make

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:84%
themselves look like
whatever they want.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:90%
Or perhaps they trapped a kid.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.615 align:middle line:84%
But I really don't
think that these

00:24:24.615 --> 00:24:26.640 align:middle line:84%
are five-year-old
kids running around.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What bothers you the
most about these shadow people?

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: How often
they are gaining access

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.840 align:middle line:90%
to people and kids, too.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.170 align:middle line:90%
They are terrorizing children.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.730 align:middle line:90%
They are terrorizing everybody.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And how people don't always
recognize the danger.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have
family members that

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:50.480 align:middle line:90%
have been harassed by them.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, bless your home.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Clean it out.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Do this type of thing.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're just like,
well, it's kind of neat.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Don't entertain those.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of it.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Because the closer
it gets, who knows?

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it will
choke you to death.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:90%
You just don't know.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's a matter of
taking the initiative

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:84%
to put your ethereal foot
down in their backside

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:90%
and send them on their way.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.560 align:middle line:84%
One thing that's
important to note

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the shadow
people topic, a lot of people

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:84%
think I came at this as a
paranormal investigator.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in a haunted house.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I had an interest in the ghosts,
just what the heck are they?

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't like, hey,
kumbaya ghost for me.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Hunting ghosts,
I didn't do that.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But I did have some
UFO encounters.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And I had a situation where
I woke up to like nine grey

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.350 align:middle line:90%
aliens in my apartment once.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.305 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nine?

00:25:48.305 --> 00:25:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Nine.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely nuts.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I'd spoken to you on
your show about it.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
craziest experience.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.630 align:middle line:84%
It's strange, but this is how
shadow people got launched back

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:middle line:90%
into my life.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen the one that
followed my friend.

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:07.164 align:middle line:84%
And I had joined this
UFO discussion group,

00:26:07.164 --> 00:26:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the people
that were in the group

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.470 align:middle line:90%
were alien abductees.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.325 align:middle line:90%
I'd only seen like huge UFOs.

00:26:12.325 --> 00:26:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So you could go
if you saw a UFO.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.010 align:middle line:90%
So I went.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, I saw-- I woke up.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:90%
I heard noise in my apartment.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:19.961 align:middle line:90%
And I lived alone.

00:26:19.961 --> 00:26:20.835 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, my God.

00:26:20.835 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Somebody broke in.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm about to die.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.860 align:middle line:90%
My phone's not near me.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.376 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what do I do?

00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Adrenaline's pumping.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.690 align:middle line:90%
And I jump up.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:90%
And my door was wide open.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, there's
like pint-size, like children

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.730 align:middle line:84%
little things with
their backs to me.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, hold it.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not scared anymore
because there's

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.610 align:middle line:90%
children in my apartment.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:42.720 align:middle line:90%
But they're bald-headed.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I walked up in
between two of them

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.780 align:middle line:90%
going through my bookshelf.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.884 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at the one.

00:26:47.884 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:90%
I looked at the other.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.555 align:middle line:84%
And they had my
stuff in their hands.

00:26:50.555 --> 00:26:52.365 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, who are you guys?

00:26:52.365 --> 00:26:53.365 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:26:53.365 --> 00:26:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Put my stuff down.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:90%
It was strange.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.180 align:middle line:84%
But going through my
apartment, there was others.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of 'em-- all of them
didn't have clothes on except

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:90%
for one.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.596 align:middle line:90%
It had suspenders.

00:27:05.596 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Not suspenders, but like
a jumpsuit-type thing.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:09.400 align:middle line:90%
And I grabbed it.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.230 align:middle line:90%
And I picked it up.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of--

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shook it.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah, I did.
[LAUGHS] I'm so sorry.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.912 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't mean
to abuse an alien.

00:27:15.912 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84%
But it was actually
one of those hybrids.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.320 align:middle line:84%
It was half human, half
alien-type looking thing.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:84%
But to make a long story short,
right after this incident,

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe a day or two, one of those
big, black, head and shoulder

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:84%
shadow things came
into my place.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what is this?

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.612 align:middle line:84%
I just got rid of
these little creatures.

00:27:35.612 --> 00:27:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And now I see these big,
massive, black things.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.200 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what was going on.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:90%
But I'd seen this before.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It was following my friend.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:47.030 align:middle line:84%
From that point on, it
became this ongoing onslaught

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:90%
of seeing these creatures.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.235 align:middle line:84%
And I was always describing
it to my friends,

00:27:51.235 --> 00:27:52.360 align:middle line:90%
this big, black thing came.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like,
you know, I'll just

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.919 align:middle line:90%
call them shadow people.

00:27:54.919 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:84%
These shadow people
things came again.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.130 align:middle line:90%
And they're just like, what?

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm like,
shadow spiders.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:90%
And then I moved.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:90%
It still kept going on.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.150 align:middle line:90%
I got a college roommate.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And she was very religious,
Pentecostal, don't

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.120 align:middle line:84%
talk to me about your
crazy stuff type of thing.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.690 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, whatever.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.010 align:middle line:90%
But she saw aliens.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And they see through things
and shadowy things, too,

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:90%
in the apartment.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And then she had an incident
where an alien being

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:30.430 align:middle line:84%
jumped on the hood of her car
and started speaking to her.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.161 align:middle line:84%
And she was in such a
panic talking to me.

00:28:33.161 --> 00:28:35.660 align:middle line:84%
She called me up, Heidi, I don't
know what I saw, oh my God,

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:90%
and just carrying on.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.480 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of class she was
calling me and just freaking

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, calm down.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:90%
What are you're talking about?

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.780 align:middle line:84%
An alien jumped on the hood of
your car in the broad daylight?

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.340 align:middle line:90%
I had never heard such a thing.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.130 align:middle line:84%
She said, and you know
when you go to a dentist

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.350 align:middle line:90%
and your mouth goes numb?

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.975 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yeah.

00:28:50.975 --> 00:28:52.630 align:middle line:84%
She's like, my mouth
went numb and it

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:84%
started answering me
using my own mouth.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.114 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:28:58.114 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
to think of it.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.035 align:middle line:90%
Later on, we meet up.

00:29:01.035 --> 00:29:02.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to her.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And she essentially told me, I
feel like I need to meditate.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm like , should I leave?

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:10%
We're sitting in my car.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:10%
It's just like, what?

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:13.816 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know you meditated.

00:29:13.816 --> 00:29:15.060 align:middle line:10%
What?

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.580 align:middle line:10%
And this entity started
speaking through her.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.360 align:middle line:10%
She had a very thick
Hispanic accent prior.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.872 align:middle line:10%
It reduced and started
talking about things

00:29:24.872 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:10%
that I knew she didn't
know things about.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.310 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm like, hold on.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.025 align:middle line:90%
Who is talking?

00:29:30.025 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:90%
And what is going on here?

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And it described itself
as being an alien

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.860 align:middle line:90%
and said its name was Cafth.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
C-A-F-T-H. And I'm
like, OK, Cafth.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.010 align:middle line:84%
If you're an alien, show
yourself type of thing.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:49.690 align:middle line:90%
And a hum filled the car.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And I don't how to say, but
right between the two of us

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:57.700 align:middle line:84%
formed this pinkish,
fleshy form.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, OK,
I think I see something.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.231 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I see something.

00:30:01.231 --> 00:30:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I was like, oh,
but it's not really clear.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And it spoke through her again.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:84%
It said, well, you
have weak human eyes.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, well.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.800 align:middle line:90%
A blow to us humans.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem
to be everywhere.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.009 align:middle line:90%
Heidi, we're out of time.

00:30:12.009 --> 00:30:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
being on "Beyond Belief,"

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh, yeah.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Heidi
Hollis-- creatures,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:10%
entities, shadow people,
they're out there.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:23.636 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:30:23.636 --> 00:30:39.267 align:middle line:90%
