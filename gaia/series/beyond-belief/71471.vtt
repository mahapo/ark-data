00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.185 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.524 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:10%
to "Beyond Belief" with
human computer Howard Bloom.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:10%
In our earlier
edition with Howard,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.380 align:middle line:10%
we talked about high technology.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
is available to you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and you can just go to
beyondbelief.com and look

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:90%
at all the other past programs.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But today on "Beyond
Belief" with Howard,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
something different.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Later in the show,
Ask Howard, where

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show him a picture
and have him react to it.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to talk
with Howard about something

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.400 align:middle line:84%
that has always been not only
on my mind, but fascinating.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
energy of a human.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.290 align:middle line:90%
The psychic vampire.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:84%
The person, Howard, who
literally sucks the life out

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.399 align:middle line:84%
of people and may
not even know it.

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Has that happened to you?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD BLOOM:
Sounds like wives.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're a woman, sounds
like your husband, right?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.140 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Most people energize me.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:10%
But George, you have
to be selective.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:10%
You have to hang out with
the people who energize you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:10%
and you have to stay
away from the people who

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:10%
decrease your energy.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is that what you do?

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.876 align:middle line:10%
>>BLOOM: Well, my
second marriage.

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:10%
Look, I thought I was
going to be married once

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:10%
and that's it for life.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:90%
And I was married for 34 years.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:90%
Not bad, right?

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not bad at all.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Not a bad start.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a good run.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.569 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yeah, but
in 1988, I came down

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:90%
with his vicious illness.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And for five years, I
was too weak to speak.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And for 15 years, I was too
weak to get out of my bedroom.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So my wife eventually
got tired of that.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
too much for her.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.033 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yeah, if you look
at the research, people

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:84%
who are caregivers lose
five years of their life.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:90%
The stress is much too much.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you can't blame her.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: I can't blame
her at all, not at all.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So she pulled out and she went
back to where she'd come from,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:90%
Kingston, New York.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm from Brooklyn, New
York, where I live.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:90%
And I was desperate.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And I shopped for a second
wife online, on the Internet.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.323 align:middle line:84%
And I found one
through Match.com.

00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:14.823 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:14.823 --> 00:02:15.864 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Well, you know--

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A success story?

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.629 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: No.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Not by any stretch
of the imagination.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:90%
A psychic vampire story.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So I had heard this
word "screamer."

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But I had never imagined
that a real person like that

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.080 align:middle line:90%
could possibly exist.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I had wife number two.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And wife number two
screamed about everything.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely everything.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But of course,
how would you know that?

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yes.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And a person-- some
people are really gifted.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:84%
When she was looking for
a present for somebody,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:84%
she had this gift for finding
absolutely the sweet spot.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.815 align:middle line:84%
The strangest gifts, but the
most amazingly on-target gift.

00:02:47.815 --> 00:02:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For that person.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.554 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Right.

00:02:49.554 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle line:84%
But that same skill
went into finding

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
the thing you enjoyed most
in life and destroying it.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
That was her normal
daily course of business.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, she didn't regard
herself this way,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and she wasn't deliberately
doing that to people.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't using her talents
for evil deliberately.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:84%
But she developed
this, god knows,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:84%
as a defense mechanism
when she was a child

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
to respond to her family
situation or something

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:84%
One way or the other,
find the things

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:84%
that people love the most,
find it with great talent,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
suck those things out of them
and you can destroy them.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.845 align:middle line:90%
So there are psychic vampires.

00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Old guy I
knew in Saint Louis.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.970 align:middle line:84%
We'd go to the Ritz Carlton
and sit there and have a drink

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.845 align:middle line:90%
every once in awhile.

00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:90%
And it was a huge lobby bar.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was full of people
having a great time.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And during the Thanksgiving,
Christmas season, Howard,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.200 align:middle line:90%
it was just fantastic.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.950 align:middle line:84%
There was always a
guy there named Andy.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Andy would sit at
the bar and I noticed

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.610 align:middle line:90%
that nobody was around him.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:90%
And it fascinated me.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have friends.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:84%
People would kind of
shift away from him.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at him
as a science study.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Andy, tell me a
little bit about yourself.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And everything out of his
mouth was a black cloud.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I've got two kids, but
you know, they're brats.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm going through a divorce.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.600 align:middle line:90%
I hate her.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Everything was negative.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
I said, every word out of your
mouth when I came here tonight

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.920 align:middle line:90%
was negative.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.500 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't one
positive thing that

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:84%
wanted me to stick around
here and listen to you.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:90%
You're my experiment.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm here.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:90%
I saw him about a month later.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
There were people
standing around him.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.404 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Amazing.

00:04:32.404 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's like a magnet.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I go up to
him and I said, Andy?

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:90%
And he went, thank you.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what'd you do?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.885 align:middle line:84%
And he said, everything
I do now is positive.

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:45.385 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:46.105 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Fantastic.

00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If it's rainy--

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Right.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.016 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --I'm
telling people it's

00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:90%
going to be sunny tomorrow.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And he worked at it
and he changed it.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:90%
He got a new relationship.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:90%
He enjoys his kids.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most amazing
turnaround I've ever seen.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't see that all the time.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Right.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, perception has the power
to deprive us of even the best

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:84%
things that we've
got, or to give us

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
the best things that we've
got from the things that

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:90%
seem the worst.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.876 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important
to hold a balance.

00:05:15.876 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:84%
You've got to see
your positives.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:84%
America's been seeing
nothing but its negatives

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.365 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:05:21.365 --> 00:05:22.199 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.615 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yeah, and
the result is--

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.060 align:middle line:90%
and we don't see our positives.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
The result is we're going
to cheat our grandkids out

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.510 align:middle line:84%
of the positives that we
could have given them if only

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:84%
we had seen things
in balance, seeing

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:84%
both the positives
and the negatives.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
The negatives are good
when you can use them

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:90%
as a corrective mechanism.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:84%
We can use them to
make things better.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.704 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't see the
positives and cherish them,

00:05:44.704 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:90%
you're in big trouble.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:90%
There's a Bloomism.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:90%
"Never throw a grace away.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Never throw a blessing away."

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Now you might find
blessings and grace

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
odd pieces of terminology
coming from an atheist.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, certain things
land on you as if by accident

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and turn out to be
remarkably good.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Even more extraordinary,
certain things

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
that land on you
that seem horrible

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.774 align:middle line:90%
can be turned into positives.

00:06:07.774 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: And it's our job
to seize the positive.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I have a colleague
named Valarius Geist.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the leading
researchers of large mammal

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:90%
behavior.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a colleague in
evolutionary biology.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And Val says all signals of
any kind between any living

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
creatures whatsoever come
down to attraction cues

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:90%
and repulsion cues.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Andy was giving
off repulsion cues.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:84%
He needed to see the
positives of those.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Having kids is a great thing.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are negatives
to having kids.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Squalling in the middle of the
night from an eight-month-old,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.314 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're expensive.

00:06:45.314 --> 00:06:46.294 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah, right.

00:06:46.294 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:90%
There are lots of negatives.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:90%
But the joy is insane.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you throw that joy out
by refusing to perceive it,

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.330 align:middle line:84%
you've not just denied
yourself something vital,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:90%
think about those kids.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.230 align:middle line:84%
They depend on the joy that they
see lighting up in your eyes

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:90%
when you see them.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:90%
That's what they live on.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:84%
That's what gives them their
sense of their own identity

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:90%
and worth in the world.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.610 align:middle line:84%
So you're not just
wiping out your own joy,

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
you're wiping out
something they need

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
to proceed through the
rest of their lives.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to
seize your joys wherever

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
you find them and turn as
many negatives into positives.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Now you can't
become a Pollyanna.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.896 align:middle line:84%
You can't fail to
see the negatives.

00:07:27.896 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if you fail
to see them, you're

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.215 align:middle line:84%
going to step into a
pothole and disappear.

00:07:31.215 --> 00:07:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And hurt yourself.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yeah, or you'll
step in front of a bus.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.986 align:middle line:90%
But it's a matter of balance.

00:07:37.986 --> 00:07:40.535 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were bedridden
for more than a decade.

00:07:40.535 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: During this
horrendous time in your life,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:90%
did you stay upbeat?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: At one point,
I tried to kill myself.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was so successful
that I-- almost successful--

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
that I was laying like a
corpse on the bed for three

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:90%
days and three nights.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up, I
had stigmata points

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:84%
where the blood had
broken through the skin.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Because the blood weighs a lot
and the skin isn't that strong.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.034 align:middle line:90%
And it came out here and here.

00:08:05.034 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sheesh.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.075 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: So I could've applied
for sainthood or something

00:08:08.075 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, I lost the use of
three arms in that experience.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
I wrote three books.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I founded two international
scientific groups.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And I learned an awful lot, a
tremendous amount about life.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't toss
that experience away.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't choose not to have
that experience for the world.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I learned when
I was a kid-- 16 years old--

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.980 align:middle line:84%
there were two poems that
meant the world to me.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
One was "The Love Song of J.
Alfred Prufrock," by TS Eliot.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:84%
And it says, if you have
something heroic to do in life,

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.069 align:middle line:84%
if you have something to do
that you think will define you,

00:08:44.069 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:84%
that you think will
attract women to you,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.130 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that you
want in life, do it now.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.280 align:middle line:90%
Start today.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Start this minute.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Work, work, work toward it.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.574 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you will
wake up one day

00:08:56.574 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and the life force
you would have needed

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish that
thing will be gone

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and there is no recovery
past that point.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:84%
The second poem was a
poem called "Renascence"

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.065 align:middle line:90%
by Edna St. Vincent Millay.

00:09:07.065 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And it said, if you want
to see the infinite-- it's

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:84%
back to Michael Jackson, seeing
the infinite in the tiniest

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:84%
of things-- if you want to see
the infinite in the tiniest

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle line:84%
of things, open your
heart, open your empathy

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:84%
so that you can feel the
feelings of everybody

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:84%
on the face of the Earth going
through every kind of extreme.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:84%
She focused on
negative extremes.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I like to focus on both
negative and positive extremes.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:90%
And she was right.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So what did being in a
bed for 15 years teach me?

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
It taught me that
solitary confinement

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.849 align:middle line:84%
is a torture that's
utterly beyond belief.

00:09:38.849 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is a torture.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Your body and
your mind produce tortures

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:84%
that you never

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and for which there are no
words in the English language.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you in

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, could

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:90%

>>BLOOM: I could
go to the bathroom.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:90%
That's the most I could do.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, I was able to
do that during the whole time.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:90%
But that was it.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
that how would I

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:84%
have ever come to experience
that extreme of isolation?

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:84%
How would I have ever come to
meet a challenge like not being

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.299 align:middle line:84%
able to speak and still
write a book while I

00:10:11.299 --> 00:10:12.215 align:middle line:90%

00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:12.955 align:middle line:90%

>>BLOOM: Yeah.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
One night when Art Bell
was still doing the show,

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:84%
one night Art called and I
was in terrible condition.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, when you have
chronic fatigue syndrome,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:84%
the illness I had, your
thermal regulatory system

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:90%
goes out of whack.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And it means that it
can be 98 degrees out

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:90%
and you can be shivering.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had a bunch
of air conditioners

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.103 align:middle line:84%
on because I had discovered that
unless I kept the temperature

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:47.600 align:middle line:84%
below 68 degrees,
I couldn't think.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.183 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:48.183 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And Art could hear it.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.932 align:middle line:84%
And Art had booked four
hours with me for that night.

00:10:55.932 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And Art said, oh
my god, I think we

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:84%
made a mistake in
booking you tonight.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no,
Art, it'll be OK.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, we did four
hours soaringly.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you and Art used to
save my life in those days.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you gave me
an outside world.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have it
except through you.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So I will forever be grateful
to "Coast to Coast" for that.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But one way or the
other, research

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.354 align:middle line:84%
demonstrates the people
who value life the most

00:11:22.354 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and are the happiest are
not the people who've

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:84%
had the use of all four
limbs during all their lives

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.960 align:middle line:90%
and perfectly good health.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the people
who've lost a limb.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the people who've
lost something profound.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the people who've been
through serious illnesses.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.776 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
are-- when you go

00:11:35.776 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
through an illness
like that, you

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:84%
realize not how little you

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:90%

What got you out of bed?

00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: We don't know.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%

00:11:51.034 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:84%
It takes an hour just
to take the drugs.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I'm listening to
magazine articles and journal

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:90%
articles and stuff like.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not wasted time by any
stretch of the imagination.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.820 align:middle line:84%
But I think the big
drug is gabapentin.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Gabapentin works on--
and this is true for you,

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.110 align:middle line:84%
it's true for me, it's
true for everybody.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:84%
You have a system,
a nervous system,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.430 align:middle line:84%
that works on a balance between
excitement and inhibition.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:90%
The gas and the brakes.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And the gas-- the
excitement-- is glutamate.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And the brakes-- the
inhibition-- is gaba.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And gaba-- gabapentin--
works on gaba.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:35.770 align:middle line:84%
So presumably, my nervous system
was on over speed all the time,

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and was more than a
system could take.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was burning
out all of my energy.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So when I got these
two back in balance,

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.159 align:middle line:84%
it's just like
anything else in life.

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It's about the balance between
optimism and negativism.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it gradual for you?

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:90%
Or did you just pop out of bed?

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Took about five years.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.540 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very slow.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.347 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember when you
told me, on the air again,

00:12:55.347 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:90%
you're not in bed anymore.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Right.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I couldn't believe it.

00:12:57.795 --> 00:12:59.378 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: It was an
amazing experience.

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Because first I got an
invitation to go out-- first,

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I keynoted a thing called the
Global Entertainment and Media

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Summit in New York City.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.270 align:middle line:10%
And it was an
exhilarating experience,

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:10%
because I've spent all
my life in science,

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.520 align:middle line:10%
but only 17 years of my life
in music working with Prince,

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.180 align:middle line:10%
Michael Jackson, Bob
Marley, Bette Midler, ACDC,

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:10%
all of those people.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:84%
So to be welcomed back
into music even briefly

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.510 align:middle line:90%
was a tremendous homecoming.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.935 align:middle line:84%
And then that
speech went so well

00:13:26.935 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that they invited me to keynote
the Global Entertainment

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:90%
and Media Summit in LA.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.992 align:middle line:84%
That was taking a
huge risk, George.

00:13:32.992 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I'd
learned in this illness--

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
have had a break down.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.644 align:middle line:84%
You overstep the
boundaries and--

00:13:37.644 --> 00:13:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
pushed it too far.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yes, and you are back
in bed unable to speak again.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But I took a chance
and came out here.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they asked me--
International Conference

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.102 align:middle line:84%
of Quantum Physicists asked
me to Moscow to tell-- well,

00:13:49.102 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know what I
was going to tell them.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
What I was going
to tell them is why

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.300 align:middle line:84%
everything they know about
quantum physics is wrong.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:90%
And they sat there.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.956 align:middle line:84%
George, I was sure
these guys were

00:13:57.956 --> 00:14:00.030 align:middle line:84%
going to throw me out
of their conference.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I've just undermined
the entire discipline

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
in which they've
made their lives.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And they sat there beaming
as if it were my bar mitzvah

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.648 align:middle line:84%
and they were all my
uncles, and I'd just

00:14:07.648 --> 00:14:09.037 align:middle line:90%
done an incredible job.

00:14:09.037 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't understand why.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Five years later, I
have a collaborator

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
in theoretical physics
at the Keldysh Institute

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:18.130 align:middle line:84%
of Applied Mathematics of the
Russian Academy of Sciences.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And he emailed and
said Dr. Rujikof, who

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.510 align:middle line:84%
was running that conference,
has just published a book.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:84%
You have to download it
from arXiv.org immediately.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.450 align:middle line:90%
So I downloaded it.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I listened to it on
my Kindle while I

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:90%
was walking through the park.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.840 align:middle line:90%
I got widely excited.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Every concept I had given
in that presentation

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.070 align:middle line:90%
was in this book.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote a note to
Dr. Rujikof and I said,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Rujikof, I don'
know if you remember me,

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:84%
but I'm that crazy American
who spoke at your conference.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.645 align:middle line:84%
And I got one of those emails
that you get every great once

00:14:46.645 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:84%
in a while that
says, remember you?

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.344 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you read the
first half of this book?

00:14:52.344 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's all about you.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah, so.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And then Seoul,
Korea and Chengdu,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle line:90%
China and Kuala Lumpur.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And all of these were
major speaking engagements.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Kuala Lumpur had
me design a program called

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:84%
"Re-Preceiving Leadership,"
a two-day intensive program

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:90%
for CEOs and general managers.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And I gave this really
intensive program

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to these 10 CEOs and
general managers.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And remember, I'm a
Zionist atheist Jew.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:90%
This is a Muslim Country.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.613 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right

00:15:22.613 --> 00:15:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: And we had a ball.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't the
planet get along like that?

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: One of the
greatest things for me

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that this
sheik who runs Dubai

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and who also doubles as the
prime minister of the United

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Arab Emirates?

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:38.225 --> 00:15:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: He's named a race
horse after one of my books.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.384 align:middle line:84%
"The Beast," it's called,
after "The Genius of the Beast:

00:15:43.384 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
A Radical Revision
of Capitalism."

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --like Latoum,
or something like that?

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.415 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Oh, it's Al Maktoum.

00:15:47.415 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They love
thoroughbred horses.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.623 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah.

00:15:49.623 --> 00:15:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm the Zionist atheist Jew.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.846 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in the
Middle East knows that.

00:15:54.846 --> 00:15:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm on Saudi TV and
Iranian TV all the time.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I just did Iranian
television two days ago.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Iranian people, by
the way, love us.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yeah, well,
that's terrific.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the leadership
that we have problems with.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Right.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Well that's true.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So the deal is, where else is
there a sign of world peace?

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a sign of
world peace beyond belief.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
That the sheik and I are going
to have something in common.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And that my biggest
fan, he splits his time

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:84%
between Islamabad in
Pakistan and Dubai.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:90%
He has businesses in both.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So there is a possibility
for world peace.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.131 align:middle line:84%
I've spent time with two friends
from Iraq over the last 10

00:16:29.131 --> 00:16:29.630 align:middle line:90%
days.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.180 align:middle line:84%
One is probably the
leading filmmaker in Iraq.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.190 align:middle line:84%
He made two feature
films in Iraq,

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
a country that's been
at war ever since 1981.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think there's
room for world peace

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:84%
if we can get rid
of the leaders.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones,
Howard, that do this.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:84%
They are the greedy,
manipulative ones

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
that are in with
some corporations.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:90%
And all they want is war.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.984 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones
I don't trust.

00:16:54.984 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: I'm not sure.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.749 align:middle line:84%
Because war-- let's
take a look at war, OK?

00:16:58.749 --> 00:17:00.540 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say
war is the results of--

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.373 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then we'll
get into Ask Howard.

00:17:02.373 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: But they say war
is a result of agriculture,

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:84%
war is the result
of industrialism,

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:08.400 align:middle line:84%
war is the result of
modern capitalism.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.319 align:middle line:90%
How do we know?

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
Well, our first foremothers,
the very first creatures

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that were in our family
line were bacteria.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.640 align:middle line:84%
They were the very first
life forms on planet Earth.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.137 align:middle line:84%
Now bacteria live in communities
of seven trillion individuals.

00:17:23.137 --> 00:17:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you're a
Darwinist, aren't you?

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.829 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: But that's more
individuals than all the humans

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:31.064 align:middle line:84%
who have ever lived in just
one community all living

00:17:31.064 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:90%
with each other at one time.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're constantly
communicating and constantly

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.220 align:middle line:90%
doing research and development.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But if seven different colonies
zero in on the same food

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:90%
source, guess what they do?

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:90%
They make war.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:90%
And guess what they use?

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Weapons of mass destruction.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Chemical weapons.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:84%
We borrowed those
chemical weapons in 1948.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:90%
We called them antibiotics.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.150 align:middle line:84%
They're so effective
because bacteria

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.042 align:middle line:84%
have evolved these to
wipe out entire colonies.

00:17:56.042 --> 00:17:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But now what's
happened to them?

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Antibiotics are
going by the wayside.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.881 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: They're
going by the wayside

00:18:00.881 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
because these creatures
are so good at research

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:90%
and development.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.242 align:middle line:84%
So war has been around
for 3.85 billion years.

00:18:08.242 --> 00:18:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would agree.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.225 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: And it isn't
just the leaders.

00:18:10.225 --> 00:18:11.433 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's inherent in us.

00:18:11.433 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.000 align:middle line:84%
What we have done is increased
peace by a factor of nine.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:84%
We're nine times as
peaceful as we were in 1650.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:84%
We're nine times as peaceful
as those wonderful indigenous

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:84%
tribes you hear about who
live in harmony with nature

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.180 align:middle line:90%
at peace with each other.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, if you lived in
one of those tribes,

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
or I lived in one of those
tribes, the two of us

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:84%
would have had nine times the
chance of dying a violent death

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.850 align:middle line:84%
at the hands of a
fellow human being.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would have
eaten us or something.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Than we have today.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So we've accomplished
astonishing things.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
The Population Bomb has been
this great positive phenomenon.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
a long way to go.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some
of these pictures.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:53.240 align:middle line:84%
The first one I want
to show you is what?

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: That's NC Wyeth, an
early 20th century painter.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And I love this painting because
we talked in the first episode

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.522 align:middle line:84%
that we did about how
it is crucial for people

00:19:04.522 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:84%
to believe that they're
part of something

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:90%
bigger than themselves.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.584 align:middle line:84%
And there is something
bigger than yourself.

00:19:09.584 --> 00:19:11.833 align:middle line:84%
It's called in my first book,
"The Lucifer Principle,"

00:19:11.833 --> 00:19:12.760 align:middle line:90%
the super organism.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.300 align:middle line:90%
You and I are like cells.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:90%
Your body is 100 trillion cells.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Mine is 100 trillion cells.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.430 align:middle line:84%
They're all working together
to produce something bigger

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
called George Noory
or Howard Bloom.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:84%
We individuals, as
parts of a society,

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:90%
function like those cells.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And that bigger something that
comes from us is the nation,

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:90%
it's our ideals.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.870 align:middle line:84%
It's our sense of
transcendent truths.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this picture
tends to-- oh my god,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.840 align:middle line:84%
that's what this picture
tends to represent.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:90%
This one is the big bagel.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:84%
In 1959, I was working at
the world's largest cancer

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:90%
research facility.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:90%
I was 16 years old.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Now I had built my first Boolean
algebra machine when I was 12.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I had co-designed
a computer that

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:84%
won science fair
awards when I was 12.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'd had a long
conversation--

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.487 align:middle line:84%
I'd been dragged into
my local university--

00:19:59.487 --> 00:20:01.986 align:middle line:84%
the University of Buffalo-- for
a conversation with the head

00:20:01.986 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:84%
of the graduate physics
department when I was 12.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.442 align:middle line:84%
It turned out to be a debate
on big bang versus steady state

00:20:07.442 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:90%
theory of the universe.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.012 align:middle line:90%
The hottest topic of the time.

00:20:11.012 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Four years later, when I was
working at the world's largest

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.030 align:middle line:84%
cancer research lab
in Buffalo, New York,

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:84%
the big problem in theoretical
physics and cosmology

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
was, if matter and anti-matter
are created in equal amounts

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:27.035 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, where'd
all the anti-matter go?

00:20:27.035 --> 00:20:28.096 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a good one.

00:20:28.096 --> 00:20:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where is it?

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.303 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: It took me two and
1/2 months to figure it out.

00:20:31.303 --> 00:20:32.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's the big bagel.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine a bagel with
an infinitesimally tiny

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:84%
little hole and out of
the top of that hole--

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.500 align:middle line:90%
that hole is the Big Bang.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And out of the top of that
hole comes the positive matter,

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:90%
the positive universe.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Out of the bottom of that
bagel comes the anti-matter.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it keeps flowing.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yes, and
they meet each other

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
at the very edge and
annihilate, and they

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.380 align:middle line:84%
become the next
center of the bagel.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.464 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ask Howard it is.

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:58.046 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to do a
little Ask Howard--

00:20:58.046 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Oh, yes.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.342 align:middle line:90%
This is for my YouTube series.

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready for this?

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm ready for this.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.653 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: OK. (BOOMING)
You want to know why?

00:21:03.653 --> 00:21:06.950 align:middle line:90%
Ask how, Howard the Humongous.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:84%
(REGULAR VOICE) And I'm
daring to do this with one

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.150 align:middle line:84%

00:21:23.626 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:90%

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:90%
escape to the roof.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this
astonishing setting sun.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
The whole city had
turned crimson.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And I ran up with
my digital camera

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.912 align:middle line:84%
trying a dozen different

00:21:46.912 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way
that turned out best.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
That's a downed
television antenna.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And what this shows
you is Wonderland

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:84%
is right under your

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.694 align:middle line:84%

it's found honey and nectar.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:90%
There are two kinds of bees.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Conformist bees and
nonconformist bees.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:84%
The nonconformist bees are
about 5% of the entire hive.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.375 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to
waste their time.

00:22:19.375 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:90%
You and I are conformist bees.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going out
there and getting

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.875 align:middle line:90%
the pollen and the nectar.

Why are we even
bothering to feed them?

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
that when us conformist

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
bees run through all the pollen

no clue of where to go next,

the explorer bees-- the ones who

00:22:45.802 --> 00:22:47.260 align:middle line:84%

And they convey it
with this dance.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.445 align:middle line:84%
And they try to recruit you

00:22:53.445 --> 00:22:55.153 align:middle line:84%
their findings and
then come back and act

00:22:55.153 --> 00:22:55.945 align:middle line:90%

They form a collective

form a collective intelligence.

to hundreds of thousands of
times in your lifetime, George.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a reflection
in a raindrop on a car.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's a reflection
of the tree above.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And every time it rains, when
you walk down the street,

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.590 align:middle line:84%
you pass thousands of
these little microcosms.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And don't
even notice them.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.006 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: That's right.

00:23:36.006 --> 00:23:38.435 align:middle line:84%
And it took me 10
years to get this shot.

00:23:38.435 --> 00:23:39.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You took
that as a picture?

00:23:39.935 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yes.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a photograph.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what does
that tell you about life?

00:23:44.745 --> 00:23:46.997 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: It tells you that
there is so much richness.

00:23:46.997 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:84%
It tells you that Andy,
who is sitting at the bar,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.170 align:middle line:84%
had so much richness
that he was overlooking

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:84%
that it went utterly
beyond belief.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And it tells you why
Michael Jackson to me

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.050 align:middle line:84%
is most important
person I've ever met.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Because he saw the infinite
in the tiniest of things.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this says that
even for Michael Jackson,

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:84%
there would have been an
infinity of infinities left.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Even if he'd lived
to the age of 100.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Next one.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: You've seen
this so many times

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:84%
in one variation or other
that it's ridiculous.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
That you open the
bathroom cabinet

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and there's your wife's
hair curler sitting next

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.400 align:middle line:90%
to her comb.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.381 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:24:25.381 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A nice
tight shot of that.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.694 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: But look at the colors.

00:24:28.694 --> 00:24:30.318 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what
does that illustrate?

00:24:30.318 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: It
illustrates that, OK,

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
until modern industrial
dyes were developed

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.156 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th century,
people walked around

00:24:38.156 --> 00:24:39.280 align:middle line:90%
in a black-and-white world.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there were green
leaves on the trees.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the sun was yellow.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:43.812 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the sky was blue.

00:24:43.812 --> 00:24:45.270 align:middle line:84%
But when it came
to the things they

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:84%
lived with on a
day-to-day basis,

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:84%
none of these blacks, none of
those reds, none of those blues

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.940 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Those were miracles in 1850.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Absolute miracles.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:90%
And we overlook them.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.750 align:middle line:84%
The pink of your tie on
the black of your shirt.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't have
been possible in 1850.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: And all
these astonishing--

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd be a freak.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yeah, we don't realize
these are bloody miracles right

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.044 align:middle line:90%
under our nose.

00:25:10.044 --> 00:25:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any more
pictures here, Howard?

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Oh, oh, you've got
to take a guess at this one.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.539 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this looks like
a tight shot of some plant

00:25:19.539 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Well, you're close.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.554 align:middle line:84%
You know those plastic
things you get.

00:25:23.554 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:90%
And they have a top on them.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And you throw food in them
and you put in the microwave

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and you blast it
for six minutes.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And you take it
out and you eat it.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.571 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's like the
dew on it, or something.

00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: It's the dew
on the lid on the top.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.734 align:middle line:84%
And so you see this
a million times

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:84%
when you go in your
kitchen and are just

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:84%
doing a little
cooking for yourself.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.854 align:middle line:84%
The idea behind
these is wake up.

00:25:42.854 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Look at the things
right under your nose

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:84%
as if you've never
seen them before.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.372 align:middle line:84%
That's where the beginning
of all wonder is.

00:25:48.372 --> 00:25:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And wonder is the
beginning of questions.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.585 align:middle line:84%
And questions are the
beginning of science.

00:25:51.585 --> 00:25:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is
a great picture.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:53.606 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Thanks.

00:25:53.606 --> 00:25:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's go to one more.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:56.905 align:middle line:90%
Ah, a drone.

00:25:56.905 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yes, and the
reason I showed you this

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.800 align:middle line:90%
is because look at this.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It's got autonomous
intelligence.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:84%
You can program it
from your iPhone.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that one of the toy drones?

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yes, it's
one of the toy drones.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it yours?

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: No.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I unfortunately don't
own one of these.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.700 align:middle line:84%
No room in my messy,
messy bedroom.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But this will do things--
again, talk about the fact

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that you're born with twice as
many brain cells as you need.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:84%
If you start playing with one
of these at the age of six,

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:84%
operating it with your iPhone,
what new brain assemblies are

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.030 align:middle line:84%
you going to have that no
generation before you has ever,

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:90%
ever had?

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:90%
Toys reshape our brains.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And in reshaping our
brains, eventually they

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:84%
reshape our fantasies and
we build new realities

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.410 align:middle line:90%
based on our fantasies.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:90%
People like Elon Musk do it.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.230 align:middle line:90%
People like Steve Jobs do it.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.680 align:middle line:90%
People like you do it.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.830 align:middle line:90%
People like me try to do it.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:51.600 align:middle line:84%
But toys are the ways we
begin the process that

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.085 align:middle line:90%
leads to refashioning reality.

00:26:53.085 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My favorite
movie, "It's

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.180 align:middle line:84%
a Wonderful Life,"
with Jimmy Stewart.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:84%
I remember it from the first day
my mother sat me down and said,

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.190 align:middle line:84%
"Georgie, I want you
to watch this movie."

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And it had the greatest
message of the world,

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:09.840 align:middle line:90%
that we all do count in society.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
We all do touch other people's
lives in some form or fashion.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.814 align:middle line:84%
And when that movie was shown,
it was not well received.

00:27:18.814 --> 00:27:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Really?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.090 align:middle line:90%
It was not a box-office success.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:90%
But it came later.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I can't think of a
holiday season, Howard,

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.140 align:middle line:84%
where I don't look
at that movie.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I even bought it on DVD just
to keep for posterity one day.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But the message is you
count, no matter what.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: In looking
at these pictures,

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.924 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that I've left
out is intimate relationships.

00:27:43.924 --> 00:27:46.090 align:middle line:84%
The things that we're able
to generate in the hearts

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and lives of-- you had no idea
of how much you were saving me

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.250 align:middle line:90%
in the days when I was in bed.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:90%
You can have no idea.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:90%
And yet, you were doing it.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And so we do things
for each other

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.330 align:middle line:90%
that are utterly beyond belief.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And even to have the
privilege of a relationship,

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.390 align:middle line:84%
or a set of relationships
in which people count

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.920 align:middle line:90%
on you for warmth and stability.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.296 align:middle line:84%
That's a blessing
utterly beyond belief.

00:28:07.296 --> 00:28:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I certainly didn't
have that when

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I was isolated in a
bedroom and couldn't even

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.650 align:middle line:84%
have another person in the
room for all those years.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.040 align:middle line:84%
These are great
gifts and you have

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.736 align:middle line:90%
to be grateful for your gifts.

00:28:18.736 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we get society

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: I'm hoping we can.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I've written six books and those
haven't made much of a dent,

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.580 align:middle line:84%

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Right.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.141 align:middle line:84%
And some people write me
and say these books have

00:28:34.141 --> 00:28:35.600 align:middle line:84%
changed their lives,
which is good.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's changing the
lives of a few 100 people,

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:39.610 align:middle line:90%
or maybe a few 1,000 people.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And we have a nation of 315
million people approximately

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.591 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have to bring these kinds
of messages to all of them.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:90%
You are doing that.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.879 align:middle line:84%
You try to do that to
the best of your ability

00:28:51.879 --> 00:28:52.920 align:middle line:90%
through "Coast to Coast."

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.840 align:middle line:90%
I try to do that.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I've been on "Coast to

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: --show.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But we have to do it with
all our hearts and souls.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The only ones who
can save us are us,

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.714 align:middle line:90%
and that means it's up to us.

00:29:12.714 --> 00:29:14.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You see, worldwide,
if I were president,

00:29:14.755 --> 00:29:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd be meeting with Putin
right now and I'd say,

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.372 align:middle line:84%
Vlad, we need to
go out and talk.

00:29:20.372 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Take him out to dinner.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: And you'd have
a good reason to talk.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.136 align:middle line:84%
What's happening in Iraq right
now with the Islamic militants.

00:29:26.136 --> 00:29:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Ukraine.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.510 align:middle line:90%
This world is just in flux.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:29.718 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: But here's the deal.

00:29:29.718 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:84%
What's happening in
particular in Iraq

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.490 align:middle line:84%
can destabilize the
entire Middle East.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And Vladimir Putin's
got a population

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:84%
of about 180 Muslims
living under him.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:84%
A whole bunch of
Muslim states are

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.580 align:middle line:90%
part of the Russian Federation.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And he is in greater
danger of being toppled

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.750 align:middle line:84%
by the Islamic
extremists than we are.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.480 align:middle line:84%
So we need to work
together on this.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Now we Americans have muffed it.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.660 align:middle line:84%
We have dropped the
ball a couple of times.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.920 align:middle line:84%
The Tsarnaev brothers and
the Boston marathon bombing.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:84%
They tried to get
the word to us.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.912 align:middle line:84%
We didn't pay any
attention to them.

00:30:02.912 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And there have been a
number of other occasions

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.703 align:middle line:90%
where they've tried.

00:30:05.703 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We knew things during
9/11 that they messed up.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.390 align:middle line:90%
They screwed up.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:09.973 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah.

00:30:09.973 --> 00:30:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
get more on the ball.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And we have to recognize
that three nations have

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.430 align:middle line:84%
really big problems
with Islamic extremism.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:84%
See if you think these nations
should have anything in common

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.540 align:middle line:84%
or you'd like to see these
nations discussing anything

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.860 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:84%
The United States,
Russia and China.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.580 align:middle line:90%
All three of them.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.080 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't take
advantage of this

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.630 align:middle line:84%
to get together with
Putin and the Chinese

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.289 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, we
have a common enemy,

00:30:38.289 --> 00:30:39.830 align:middle line:84%
we're missing the
biggest peacemaker.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm afraid we only
have one shot to get this done.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.142 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Well, we do.

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately you're
not in the White House

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.090 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not in the White House.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:49.256 align:middle line:84%
Though I have reached in
there are a couple of times

00:30:49.256 --> 00:30:50.675 align:middle line:90%
and tried to nudge.

00:30:50.675 --> 00:30:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder
what I would name you.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:90%
To what cabinet post?

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.920 align:middle line:90%
What would you want?

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: The
Secretary of Infinity.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:30:59.507 align:middle line:90%
How about--

00:30:59.507 --> 00:31:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A new department?

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yes.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.370 align:middle line:90%
Or the Secretary of Insanity.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
little things like that.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.453 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There'd have to be
something for you somewhere.

00:31:07.453 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Maybe just adviser.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.730 align:middle line:10%
>>BLOOM: Well, you
know, they did--

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.080 align:middle line:10%
the Office of the
Secretary of Defense

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.760 align:middle line:10%
did a forum based on my
second book, "Global Brain,"

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.860 align:middle line:10%
and brought in people
from the State Department,

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.460 align:middle line:10%
the Energy Department,
DARPA, IBM and MIT.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:27.720 align:middle line:10%
And then they flew me out to
Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.330 align:middle line:10%
to lecture a military conference
on how to think and feel

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:33.840 align:middle line:10%
like Osama bin Laden.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So I have been pulled
into that circle.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
have the way about you.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Thanks, George.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I call him
the human computer.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Now you know why.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.570 align:middle line:10%
He's one of the
greatest people to talk

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.870 align:middle line:10%
to that I've ever experienced.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."

00:31:49.410 --> 00:32:05.300 align:middle line:90%
