00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to the Beyond Belief.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.610 align:middle line:10%
And it's my privilege
to introduce you

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.360 align:middle line:10%
to Jean-Charles Moyen, a former
French air force parachute

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.200 align:middle line:10%
commando, who is
also an ET contactee.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And he had a very
unique experience

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.960 align:middle line:84%
in his youth that gave him
extra sensory capabilities.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.982 align:middle line:84%
Jean-Charles, welcome
to the program.

00:00:36.982 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN-CHARLES MOYEN: Thank
you to receive me at your show.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.857 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
a little bit more

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:84%
about yourself and
your background.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:10%
>>MOYEN: My background is,
I'm a producer and director

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:10%
of a different movie for a
different company in the world.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And I decide with my
abilities to explain myself,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:84%
my story, unique story about
my alien-contact encounters

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.620 align:middle line:84%
during my life and my special
abilities after this abduction.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This alien contact
that happened to you,

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:90%
when did this happen?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: It happened
when I was four.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I was with my parents
in the summer.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:90%
I was playing in the sand.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, my mother raise
her head and I had disappeared.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.787 align:middle line:90%
And my parents were panicked.

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: And they decided to
search me with a live guard.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And after one hour,
they don't find me.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:90%
And my parents cry.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I reappear
in front of my parents.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you abducted?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.217 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes, I was.

00:01:44.217 --> 00:01:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
any recollection,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.600 align:middle line:84%
at four years old,
what happened to you?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%
After that, I explained
to my parents--

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.570 align:middle line:90%
I was in the spaceship.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And I met a lot of
species, different.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:90%
And I walk in the corridor and--

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At four years old,
did they hurt you at all?

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: No, no,
no, not hurt me.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything was very
good, very kind with me.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I remember, I stand on the
table, in a metal table.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
It was a-- liquid
metal intelligent.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.913 align:middle line:90%
And when I move, it follow my--

00:02:16.913 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It flowed with you.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes, exactly.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And there were
other four beings,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
like beings, in front of me
and behind and in my side.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And they check
something in my head.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jean-Charles,
did this contactee case

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:84%
happen over and over again
or was it just one time?

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Not just one time.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:84%
It's happening a lot
of times after that.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Because after my first
abduction, on the beach,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I developed something
very strange abilities,

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:84%
like my interaction with
the electricity and energy.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:84%
When I'm crying
like other child,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.413 align:middle line:90%
everything was shut down.

00:02:56.413 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
did your parents

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:90%
say when you finally came back?

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Nothing, they were--

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing?

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: No, they were
very happy they found me.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And at this moment, they
don't connect the link

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:90%
with the abduction.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
For my parents it was,
OK, we found our son.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's, OK.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But after that, there was
witness of my abilities,

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.032 align:middle line:84%
like telekinesis, something
move with my mind.

00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:24.865 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: And they
realize, oh, my God, there

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
is a connection with the
abduction on the beach.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
truly remarkable.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:84%
In an English-dubbed version
of Jean-Charles film,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:84%
his parents explained that
he actually disappeared,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:90%
as he mentioned, for an hour.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN'S MOTHER: I was
completely desperate.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.167 align:middle line:10%
>>MOYEN'S FATHER: I
think, we've made it

00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:10%
so that we don't pay attention
until we can beam you up.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:10%
And your mother said to
me, where is Jean-Charles?

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:10%
What do you mean?

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:10%
Oh, he's gone.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.838 align:middle line:10%
You were next to us
playing in the sand.

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:01.880 align:middle line:10%
>>MOYEN'S MOTHER: You were
crouching in the water

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:10%
at the water's edge.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:10%
And then, I remember you
were playing in the sand.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And you had your
shovel and your bucket.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Then suddenly, I turned
around, no more kid, that's it.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And we ran around, of course,
by interviewing all the people.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
You didn't see a
little, blond boy

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.070 align:middle line:84%
with curls with a little,
blue bathing suit and a hat?

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And it lasted one
hour, one hour of time.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Then we did the beach
from side to side.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, I was
completely destroyed.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.460 align:middle line:90%
You have to understand that.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, you were there
crouching again next to us

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:10%
as if nothing had
happened, unbelievable.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:84%
We didn't understand
what happened.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.910 align:middle line:90%
We didn't try to understand.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.780 align:middle line:84%
We never thought about
anything else, you were gone.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:10%
We didn't ask the question,
what was happening?

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:84%
because we were very
happy to have found you.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:10%
And then, we always asked
ourselves the question

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:10%
for years, what happened?

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable
testimony of your parents.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Yes, my
parents is alive.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:90%
And they are 81.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very grateful for
that they can testimony.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
All I live in my life
during all entire my life,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.510 align:middle line:84%
they can testimony, because
they were with me each time.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they
think about this episode?

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, are they in shock still?

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: No, my parents have
open mind since I was a child.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And each time I
describe something,

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.850 align:middle line:84%
there is the proof, evidence,
in front of my parents.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:90%
So it was normal.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:90%
They know I'm different.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So they keep the secret around
us, because at this moment,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:90%
there is a 45 years.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, the people
judge everything.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.750 align:middle line:84%
They can think you're crazy
or go to the psychiatric.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason why
they keep the secret about me.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jean-Charles, this
happened when you were four?

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But then, something
happened at the age of 13,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:90%
what was that?

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: In the
summer camp, I had

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:90%
a big sunstroke over my head.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:90%
And I was hospitalized.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And during my hospitalization,
they do an X-ray of my brain.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And they discover it was
like a Tic-tac capsule metal

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:90%
in my brain.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:90%
So it was very special.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And at this moment,
they put me a mask

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.430 align:middle line:90%
with a green gaze for me.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:90%
And I lost consciousness.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up in the night
with another military guys--

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:90%
white haired, blue eyes.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And he tell me, hurry up, I
don't want to miss the jump.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, I
don't understand

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:90%
what he say about the jump.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So I follow these guys, in a
big corridor, in the hospital.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:90%
We take an elevator--

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
still 13, right?

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes, 13.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: And we
take an elevator.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And we go down,
go down, go down.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And I say in myself, my God,
it's very deep for a hospital.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.060 align:middle line:90%
And I'm stressed.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm stressed, my
interaction with the light

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:90%
starts.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And the light pulsating
and shut down.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From you?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Yes, and we are
in the dark, in a elevator.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So the military guys
tell me, keep cool.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Everything is, OK.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.350 align:middle line:90%
And the light's on.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:84%
We arrive on the
basement of the hospital.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.650 align:middle line:90%
And we enter in a big hanger.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot of
children with a white suit.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me,
go to this table.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:90%
There is a table with a woman.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
She tells me, put your
hand in this little box.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:84%
It's for analyzing
your DNA signature.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:90%
I put my hand.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.285 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I feel
a heat in my hand and--

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No pain, no?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: No pain.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And she give me a
suit, a black suit,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.560 align:middle line:90%
with an emblem on my chest.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a horse wing,
like a Pegasus.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And she tell me,
go to this line--

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.410 align:middle line:84%
with other child,
go to this light.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
big hole of light.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.260 align:middle line:90%
And I enter inside.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I enter inside, I
feel tingling into my body.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I open my eyes,
I was in another hanger

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.750 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of children.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.110 align:middle line:90%
They separate girls and boys.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.380 align:middle line:90%
And they test our fear--

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:90%
many failed, but not me.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not you.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: The guys, military
guys, and the X-ray doctor

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:90%
tell me, come.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Go to this room, a shadow room.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I go inside.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And inside, I feel
something-- not a fear

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
but something very
strange in front of me.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And in a shadow, get
out a big mantis.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:84%
She put his paw in my shoulder
and communicate telepathically

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:84%
with me and tell me,
everything is, OK.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:90%
You have been chosen.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:90%
And I wake up--

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.138 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: --on my
bed in hospital.

00:09:25.138 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like you
didn't go anywhere?

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Yeah, and I say,
oh, my God, what's happening?

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:90%
And I lost consciousness again.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I wake up
with a big horn of car.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.360 align:middle line:90%
[BEEP]

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
outside of the hospital?

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.148 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: I don't
remember how I outside.

00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did you get there?

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes, exactly.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:48.097 align:middle line:84%
So I was in the bus to
go in the summer camp.

00:09:48.097 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's frightening.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yeah.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But after that, when I came
back to the summer camp--

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm 13, so I explained to my
little friend what's happening.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:84%
They treat me like you're
crazy and blah, blah, blah.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:90%
I was very, very, very sad.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So I decide, when
every boy is sleeping,

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I get up with the
chalet where I was.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:90%
And I sat down on the field.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:90%
And I say to myself--

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.800 align:middle line:90%
and I look up the stars--

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:90%
come and get me.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:90%
I can't stay here anymore.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And at this moment,
a star moving.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And the star
transformed to a disk.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:90%
And I was abducted again.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Again?

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Again, and when I
came into the spaceship--

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and at this moment, there is a
blonde woman in a silver suit--

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Human?

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Humans with
a big, blue eyes.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.060 align:middle line:84%
She tells me, hello,
my name is Maria.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But everybody call
me Mary, follow me.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And I follow this woman in a
big, big corridor, very bright.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And we saw the space view.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And we arrive in
like a school room.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.580 align:middle line:90%
And there is a lot of children.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your age?

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.737 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes, my age.

00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Older or younger?

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: But there
was different faces.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:90%
They were all extraterrestrial.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And she tells me, go to this
place, to another children.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
scared at this point?

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: No, no,
I wasn't scared.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:90%
I was oh, my God, I'm lucky.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was very happy to be
at this moment at this place.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some
video of you, Jean-Charles,

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.240 align:middle line:84%
performing telekinesis
at home at 16 years old.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's watch it and
describe what's going on.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what we're seeing.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Just thinking,
I open the light

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.570 align:middle line:90%
and shut down the light.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:90%
It was easy for me.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's you?

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Yes, it's
me at 16, yeah.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:90%
You know, when I touch my head--

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
it was so easy.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And like the drawer, I put
my hand in front of me.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And I say, come to me,
come to me, come to me.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yeah.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You still have
these abilities Jean?

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: No.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're gone?

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.820 align:middle line:10%
>>MOYEN: I don't
think it's gone.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's sleeping.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:84%
But each time something happen
now, it's when I'm stressed.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Or when I'm tired,
something shut down.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:90%
I hope everything is, OK.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, don't
shut down my studio.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about
teleportation and you.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: My first
teleportation was accidental.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I was in a school
during an exam.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And I raised my hand because
I want to go to the toilet,

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:90%
and nobody answered me.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And I realized every people
in this class was frozen.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:90%
So I decide to go to the toilet.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I enter
to the toilet, it

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.980 align:middle line:90%
was the two floor, no windows.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:90%
It's like four wall.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.440 align:middle line:90%
And I closed the door.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And there is timer for
the light at this moment.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:90%
It's very old school.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I was in a
toilet and the light shut down.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Again?

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Again, and I was dizzy.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And I feel tingling in
a fraction of second.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.100 align:middle line:90%
And I opened my eyes.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:90%
I was in the dark, OK.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:90%
And I saw the button.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:90%
And I found another button.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:90%
I opened the light.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I was in the toilet but
not the same toilet.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I was on the toilet of the
apartment of my parents

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
in a few, few kilometers
of the school.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Every stuff was
still on the table--

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:55.520 align:middle line:84%
my coat, my ID card,
my keys, everything.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So my parents tell
me, what's happening?

00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:90%
And I explain.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my God, we must
lie to the director.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Then she called the
director-- and aah,

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.508 align:middle line:84%
my son was sick and blah, blah,
blah-- and invent something.

00:14:08.508 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Made up a story.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: But the
guardian of the school

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:84%
must open the door lock inside
with no windows and no janitor

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's impossible.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:84%
It was really
teleportation, physically.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: The first
time, the second time--

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:90%
because there was second time.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:90%
I want to teleport myself.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.555 align:middle line:84%
I was on the ninth floor
of a building in Paris.

00:14:35.555 --> 00:14:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old are
you at this point?

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: 18.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.862 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:14:38.862 --> 00:14:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: I had the picture of
my girlfriend at this moment.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I'd do anything to
be with her, with my girlfriend.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So at this moment, I
feel a heat around me--

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.710 align:middle line:90%
a tingling and dizzy.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I open my
eyes, I was in the front

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.890 align:middle line:84%
of the door of the
apartment of my girlfriend

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
in a few, few, few
kilometers, again.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And she don't understand
what's happening.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.290 align:middle line:90%
And I take the phone.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:90%
I call my mother.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.810 align:middle line:90%
She called my dad.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
My dad was in the
job, what's happening?

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Jean-Charles disappear.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything is here-- the
shoes, the IDs, the keys.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And oh, my God, it's
a teleportation.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.570 align:middle line:90%
And we have an alarm.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.510 align:middle line:90%
And the door was locked inside.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:90%
And we have three keys--

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
for my mother, my
father, and me.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's another teleportation,
really teleportation.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And my dad and my mom
witnessed it again.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What can you tell us
about the particle accelerator

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:90%
at CERN?

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: The CERN work,
there is the many,

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
many years about the Hadron
Collider to unofficially

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.120 align:middle line:90%
to open the gate--

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Portals?

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yeah, portals.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why they play God.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
It's very dangerous,
because like the series,

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:84%
"Stranger Things,"
they can open a portal

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and something bad can
get out of these portals.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So during this events,
some citizen in Switzerland

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:84%
declared there is
a light striking--

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:90%
purple in the sky.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.310 align:middle line:90%
And every city was shut down.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And there is something very
strange, the reality change.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere, it's not normal
what's happening in the world

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:84%
right now and
during three years.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:45.293 align:middle line:84%
So I think, the CERN open
another reality like--

00:16:45.293 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You might be right.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yeah.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What can you tell
us about the French space

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:90%
program, Jean-Charles?

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: I would be a fight
instructor in the Commando

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Parachutiste.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And during my service,
I have a big accident,

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.567 align:middle line:90%
over my shoulder was a--

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You tore your shoulder.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.260 align:middle line:90%
And I was a--

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:84%
hospitalization in a
French military hospital.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.787 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in this
hospital, something very strange

00:17:16.787 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:90%
started happening again.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: I met a guy.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor tell,
don't talk with this guy.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:90%
OK, I talk with this guy.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he tell you why
you shouldn't talk to them?

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Because they're
the psychiatric department.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:38.670 align:middle line:90%
I say, OK.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But when I take a walk
and I meet the guy,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:84%
he tells me a story,
very, very, very creepy.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:51.240 align:middle line:84%
He tell me each night,
they saw a military

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.410 align:middle line:84%
take to the
stretcher and go down

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:90%
to the basement of the hospital.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.500 align:middle line:90%
They follow us.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And they discover
the elevator open.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And there were beings, reptilian
beings, waiting for the guys.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.098 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like they
were expecting them?

00:18:12.098 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: He tell me that.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And I say, oh, it's
not a crazy story.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a, yes--

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you witnessed this?

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: I'm not witnesses
of the reptiloid.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:84%
But the next day,
I asked the doctor,

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:84%
where is this guys
because they disappeared--

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:84%
the guys, the military
guys, disappeared?

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, it's
not your business.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Go to your room.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, wow.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: And I say--

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You stumbled
into something?

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yeah.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And in this night,
I decide to go down.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And I run in the
face of a guard.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And he tell me,
why are you here?

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's a wrong--

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:90%
sorry, it's a mistake.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it an
alien space force?

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: No, the
guard, the guard

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
was just a guard
in the hospital.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:84%
But after that, I
decide to go down again.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And I see the same scene
but it was a tall gray--

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:10.120 align:middle line:84%
reception, the stretcher
into the elevator.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.105 align:middle line:90%
You know it's a weird situation.

00:19:12.105 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
are all strangers,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.833 align:middle line:84%
seeing all these different
beings and people like that.

00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes, exactly.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever ask
yourself, Jean-Charles,

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.230 align:middle line:90%
why you?

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.370 align:middle line:10%
>>MOYEN: Why me?
uh-um, because I have

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:27.340 align:middle line:10%
a special brainwave in my head.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And I found this proof with
the investigation about myself

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:90%
with the scientist.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Dan Winter.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Dan Winter is a big scientist.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.497 align:middle line:90%
He searched--

00:19:43.497 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's a physicist.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Physicist,
yes, exactly.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And he spent 51 years to study
the brain of the special person

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
with the abilities,
like a child can

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.530 align:middle line:84%
read a book without her eyes,
like in a "Superhuman" show

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:90%
with Carolyn Cory.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And the same device
used for me to analyze

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
what's happening when I'm
trying to teleport myself.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And Dan put me this
device in my head.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.210 align:middle line:90%
And I trying to teleport.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's not working.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:33.140 align:middle line:84%
But the computer
recalled everything

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.150 align:middle line:90%
happening in my brainwave.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And when they analyze the
folder with my brainwave,

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:84%
it tells it never
seen that before.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Every brainwave, gamma
brainwave, my gamma brainwave

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.720 align:middle line:90%
was out of the charts.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.830 align:middle line:84%
They must reduce the
graphic, because it was--

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Off the charts.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: --off the
chart, exactly.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.420 align:middle line:84%
This is maybe the
reason why I was

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
recruited for the
secret space program,

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:90%
because I have this abilities.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
expect the secret program

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:84%
to exist before
you knew about it?

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: I think this program
exists since a lot of decades

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
There isn't one
secret space program.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.793 align:middle line:90%
There is a lot of programs.

00:21:16.793 --> 00:21:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many of them.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Yes, a lot of
country work in secret.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And the government
don't know this.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not the government.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of things
parallel to the government.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you mentioned
Physicist Dan Winter

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and Biologist Pat Botte
explaining the science

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
behind your extraordinary
brain activity, let's look.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAN WINTER: We
knew intuitively

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:84%
that the physics had to
be similar to what we've

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:84%
been working on, which is that
when the harmonics in the aura

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:84%
are implosive or compressive,
so the aura becomes

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:90%
very dense at the center.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And what enabled them
is the less coherent,

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.090 align:middle line:84%
transverse electromagnetic
due to the squeezing implosive

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:84%
process through the
Planck threshold.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
What emerges is what's called
longitudinal EMF coherence,

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:84%
sometimes called scalar,
torsional, Vril, bar

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:84%
from the cow, or the Cezanne
body-- many names for that.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually a coherent
longitudinal field array,

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.390 align:middle line:90%
which is embeddable.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So the physics had to be that
Jean-Charles psychometric,

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:84%
his brainwave and
his breath, had

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to enter a certain
harmonic series

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:84%
to in fact become
centripetal and implosive.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Patrick and I
have spent our lifetime

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.120 align:middle line:90%
documenting what that is.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And so we introduced
Jean-Charles to Patrick.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And Patrick spent amazing
time working on this together.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:10%
>>PATRICK BOTTE: So we will
arrive at the first part here.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:10%
You see the
brainwaves are very--

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:56.400 align:middle line:10%
I have to decrease a lot,
the size of the brainwave,

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.220 align:middle line:10%
because when you get this
states, it was awful.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:10%
It was going out of the screen.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:10%
So that's the reason
why now, for the moment,

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.910 align:middle line:10%
you don't see anything
on the screen.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.660 align:middle line:10%
And then we arrive at the--

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:10%
>>WINTER: Yeah.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:10%
Then it's off the charts.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.490 align:middle line:10%
>>BOTTE: --and as Dan mentioned,
a marvelous alpha peak

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:10%
but very, very big alpha peak.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:10%
And, on the left brain,
he stopped for a while

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.600 align:middle line:10%
and start again after a while.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.638 align:middle line:10%
This is the second receiving
period, which is coming now.

00:23:28.638 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:10%
>>WINTER: Yeah, I think--

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.148 align:middle line:10%
a huge flash.

00:23:31.148 --> 00:23:32.440 align:middle line:10%
>>BOTTE: Again, the same thing.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.930 align:middle line:10%
But very, very big brain wave.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:41.240 align:middle line:10%
And it's almost the same
thing that we have with kids,

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.530 align:middle line:10%
who can see without their eyes.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.030 align:middle line:10%
>>WINTER: So the spine liquid
pump triggers that moment when

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.550 align:middle line:10%
the ventricles actually
drain and there's that--

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.860 align:middle line:10%
the ventricle horde
mechanism of Kundalini.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.110 align:middle line:10%
And that's on the left there at
around two cycles per minute.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.260 align:middle line:10%
And then, further
right, around six cycles

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:10%
per minute, which
is about 0.1 hertz,

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.010 align:middle line:10%
there's the major
white peak, which

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.190 align:middle line:10%
is brain infrasound,
but not the red peak.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:10%
But, in some cases, we see both.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.990 align:middle line:10%
But the point is, the drama
of this new release of flame

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.330 align:middle line:10%
in mind, the brain
infrasound, right along

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:10%
with the heart
infrasound, it shows

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:10%
the heart-brain
connection directly.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:10%
It's amazing.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:10%
Congratulations, Patrick.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Truly remarkable,
Jean-Charles, remarkable.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: I'm so grateful.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
people say, OK,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
if you have an
extraordinary life,

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:84%
you must have
extraordinary proof.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: And I understand
why these people say that.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:90%
And I have all this.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I have witnesses.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:90%
I have scientific proof.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.520 align:middle line:90%
I have photography for that.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:90%
I have my parents can testimony.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's all in the package.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're the real deal.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: And I'm very,
very, very grateful

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.900 align:middle line:90%
to have this evidence with me.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What conclusions have
been drawn from your tests

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:57.740 align:middle line:90%
about you?

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: The conclusion
is, I'm special,

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.823 align:middle line:90%
like everyone is special.

00:25:04.823 --> 00:25:05.865 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You always were.

00:25:05.865 --> 00:25:06.665 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yeah.

00:25:06.665 --> 00:25:09.660 align:middle line:90%
But there is the--

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:84%
it's not-- I don't
say I'm special, me.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:90%
This is a scientist say that.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:22.320 align:middle line:84%
They pass his life to test the
brain of a monk in Tibetan.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.280 align:middle line:84%
He tell me the Tibetan wave,
I have the same Tibetan wave,

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.990 align:middle line:90%
but very huge.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's scientist's proof.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
to say about that.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.190 align:middle line:90%
It's evidence.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How easy is it for
you, Jean-Charles, to teleport?

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: It's not easy because,
now, I can't do the same thing,

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.730 align:middle line:90%
but something happen.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:84%
When I want to go in
the place, I dream.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And people remember
me at this place.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But we never talk about
this the next day.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like you went,
but you don't remember?

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Me, I remember.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do remember.

00:26:05.335 --> 00:26:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yeah.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:90%
I remember.

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, I was
drawing a secret tunnel

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:17.110 align:middle line:84%
under the Sphinx and under
the pyramid of Keops.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And there is one month they
discover now the secret tunnel

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.513 align:middle line:90%
under the Sphinx.

00:26:23.513 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Which you knew about
a long time ago?

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: It was a
45 years before.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: And I have
the proof because I

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.350 align:middle line:84%
have a diary when I was
young and I write everything.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I was in the center
of the Earth,

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and I describe a dinosaur,
and the fruits very huge.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And many, many,
many years later,

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I discovered the bird
with the description

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:58.005 align:middle line:84%
in a book of a
travel into Earth.

00:26:58.005 --> 00:26:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The center
of the Earth.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.088 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: And it
describes the same thing.

00:27:01.088 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
But I was 10 when I
describe the same thing.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not in my
imagination, it's real.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
As you look back,
since you were four--

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yeah.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --what can you say
about what has happened to you?

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Are you glad?

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes, I'm glad.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No regrets?

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: No regrets.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.340 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What have you learned?

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: It's a
difficult question.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:90%
What I learn?

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:36.350 align:middle line:84%
The love is the
key of the universe

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and the exchange with
different beings in my life.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad for
this experience.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very
grateful for that.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.700 align:middle line:90%
And I don't regret it, never.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Excellent.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Your experience with the Greys--

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and the other ETs--

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --do they come
around at this point today?

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: It's a long
story to explain.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:84%
But I met the Greys
in my life in real 3D.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It's very important to clarify
because some people have

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.820 align:middle line:84%
experience in astral
travel, but not me.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Like Men in Black.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:21.288 align:middle line:84%
I met the Men in Black in front
of me real in this real life--

00:28:21.288 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The real Men in Black.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: --with my parents too.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of
things to explain.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have enough time
to explain all my life because I

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.068 align:middle line:90%
have many, many, many things.

00:28:32.068 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These things just keep
happening to you, don't they?

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever been threatened?

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: When I was 20
years, I was in my job.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Men in Black
came into my job

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.410 align:middle line:90%
and asked me to work for them.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.818 align:middle line:84%
And I say no because
they know my abilities.

00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they human?

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes, humans.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Black suit, black ties,
and black glasses.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like a "Men in Black"
the movie, but it's real.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.922 align:middle line:84%
And I have a witness at this
moment who worked with me.

00:29:09.922 --> 00:29:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know
how dangerous things

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:84%
could have been for you
when you turned them down?

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.620 align:middle line:90%
They could have killed you.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Yes, but
[LAUGHS] I guess

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.890 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to kill me
because they want to use maybe

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.070 align:middle line:90%
something inside of me.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.640 align:middle line:90%
But I trust to the universe.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people are like you,

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Jean-Charles, on this
planet, human beings who

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
have been contacted and have
these abilities since they

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.500 align:middle line:90%
were children?

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.050 align:middle line:90%
How many?

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: I don't know.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I never met before something
with a story like mine,

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:84%
with a witness, with
a scientific proof,

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.913 align:middle line:84%
with a real
confrontation, with--

00:29:52.913 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whose parents have
verified what happened to you.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: Exactly, with directed
energy weapon against me,

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.150 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.630 align:middle line:84%
maybe he exists,
someone with a story.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But, at 54 years old now,
I don't met a same person

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.550 align:middle line:90%
with the same story.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they taken you
to another planetary system?

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Me?

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.683 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, off planet.

00:30:20.683 --> 00:30:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] When I was young.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You still remember it.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:90%
It's another part.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.720 align:middle line:84%
When I was young and
I sleep in my bed.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.140 align:middle line:84%
When I wake up, I
said to my parents,

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.060 align:middle line:90%
oh, I was in the Bahamas.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And I have between my toes
and between a button of my bed

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:44.330 align:middle line:90%
white sands.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:90%
And I was tanned in my face.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: And I live in the ninth
floor in the middle of Paris.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:56.970 align:middle line:84%
The next time my dad
realized I can move.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:84%
We call this, I
move, in my dream.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And he tell me, why
don't you do too far?

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.330 align:middle line:90%
And I say, what do you mean?

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.860 align:middle line:90%
And he tell me, another planet.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I decide to be
a state like, OK, I

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:21.530 align:middle line:84%
want to get out very, very,
very, very far in the universe.

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.180 align:middle line:90%
And I wake up.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you were.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: And I
was in my pajamas.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old are you?

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: I was 10.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: OK?

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was in another planet.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.860 align:middle line:90%
And the called name Antares.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the front
of different beings,

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.990 align:middle line:84%
cat people, feline
beings, and it was insane.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
crystal into a river.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:50.480 align:middle line:90%
The river was blood.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.498 align:middle line:90%
And I remember that and--

00:31:52.498 --> 00:31:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Literally blood?

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:54.500 align:middle line:90%
Literally blood?

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.150 align:middle line:90%
And I wake up.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:57.740 align:middle line:90%
And I say, oh my God.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the next time I
can bring something.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: I'm a kid.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.143 align:middle line:84%
Everything is possible
when you are a kid.

00:32:04.143 --> 00:32:05.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you take anything?

00:32:05.435 --> 00:32:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: So I decide to take
a bag, a backpack with me,

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.310 align:middle line:90%
and sleep with my backpack.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm a kid.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, everything
is possible.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:16.380 align:middle line:90%
So I sleep.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And I wake up in the
same planet with my bag

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.680 align:middle line:90%
on my shoulder with my pajamas.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.420 align:middle line:90%
And I say, oh, it's curious.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:84%
How can I say, I'm
dreaming, when I'm dreaming?

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.230 align:middle line:90%
And I take the bottle.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I had put a bottle, an
empty bottle in plastic.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And I decide to fill the
bottle with the crystal inside

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and close the
bottle and continue

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:90%
my journey in this planet.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.150 align:middle line:90%
I wake up.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I wake up, I
search my bag, and no bag.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.703 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, it
was a lucid dream.

00:32:50.703 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They took it.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: But my bag is
on bottom of my bed.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.940 align:middle line:84%
I take my bag, and
I check my bag.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.460 align:middle line:90%
And flock, flock.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:90%
I open my bag.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And, inside, there
was the bottle

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:11.540 align:middle line:84%
with the red water with
the crystal inside.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Inside.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: I go to the kitchen
and I say to my parents,

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:19.040 align:middle line:90%
tonight I was at the same place.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And my parents say, OK,
do you bring something?

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.030 align:middle line:90%
And I say, yes.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And I put the
bottle on the table.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And my father and my dad--
my mother and my dad were--

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In shock.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Oh my God.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.910 align:middle line:90%
It was another proof.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:37.190 align:middle line:84%
All proof I bring, everything
disappeared in a few days

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:38.720 align:middle line:90%
after.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.565 align:middle line:90%
But my dad was very bright.

00:33:42.565 --> 00:33:46.070 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] He take a
photo of each times

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.110 align:middle line:90%
I bring something very strange.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.565 align:middle line:84%
And, in my movie,
about my life--

00:33:50.565 --> 00:33:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
name of your movie?

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MOYEN: "Revelation
Starseed 2."

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
do people see this?

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.787 align:middle line:90%
>>MOYEN: Yes, in a Vimeo.

00:33:57.787 --> 00:33:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Vimeo.com, yeah.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.220 align:middle line:84%
You can find me to
the JCMoyen.com.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:05.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: M-O-Y-E-N.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.420 align:middle line:10%
>>MOYEN: Yes.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.179 align:middle line:10%
>>MOYEN: M-O-Y-E-N. And this
movie is everything we spoke

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:17.130 align:middle line:10%
together with all proof
inside, with a witness,

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:21.030 align:middle line:10%
with a scientific proof, with
the photograph, and everything.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Everything is inside.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And my dad kept this
photo during many decades.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:33.630 align:middle line:10%
And when I start my movie,
he tells me, OK, son, this

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.010 align:middle line:10%
is our gift.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:41.550 align:middle line:10%
Your mother and me decided to
speak into your documentary.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.409 align:middle line:84%
And I say, oh my
God, are you sure?

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:90%
No blurred face?

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:45.659 align:middle line:90%
No blurred face.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:47.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm proud of you.

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jean-Charles, thank you

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Truly a remarkable individual.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.050 align:middle line:10%
From age four to
where he is today,

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:10%
he has had these extraordinary
contacts with those

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.380 align:middle line:10%
from other planetary systems.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:10%
Remarkable.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.830 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
