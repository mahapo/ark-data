00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm Heather Ariel, and on
this edition of "Beyond Belief"

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.370 align:middle line:84%
with George Noory,
I'm going to show you

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.060 align:middle line:84%
how astrology can be used
and applied to all aspects

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.152 align:middle line:90%
of your everyday life.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.394 align:middle line:84%
VOICEOVER RECORDING: And I
think many people today don't

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:22.360 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.726 align:middle line:84%
VOICEOVER RECORDING:
People are basically

00:00:23.726 --> 00:00:26.815 align:middle line:84%
going to keep on to help
uncover what really happened.

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:29.157 align:middle line:84%
VOICEOVER RECORDING: It felt
like something was watching me.

00:00:29.157 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:84%
VOICEOVER RECORDING: We weren't
given all the information.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.192 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.192 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:10%
Good to have you with us
with our special guest,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:10%
Astrologer, Heather Arielle
from Arielle Astrology.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And Heather, by the way, if
people want to get a hold

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:90%
of you, where do they go?

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.924 align:middle line:90%
Where do they find you?

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:10%
Oh, well, go to my website
ARIELLESASTROLOGY.COM,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:10%
and it's Arielle with two L's.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
All right, now in
our previous program

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:90%
we talked about my chart.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little
bit about astrology,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
but do a little recap on
just what is astrology.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, so astrology really
starts with the natal chart.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:10%
We need your birth time, so we
need your day, month, and year.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:10%
GEORGE: Got to be
specific on that?

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.157 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, and then the
minute, to the minute.

00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: It was 10:30
in the morning for me.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very
important, because then

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that tells me the entire
chart, what starts the chart.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we have five
personal planets.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just the sun.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
It's been very simplified,
and sometimes people

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:90%
put too much emphasis on that.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So we need to look at
all of the planets.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, as the
planets keep moving,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
they form relationships with
planets in our natal chart.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:90%
And these are called transits.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And transits are really
the cornerstone of change.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Because what can happen, you
can have the most amazing energy

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
in your natal chart, but it
can be dormant for years, even

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:90%
decades.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:84%
It takes a specific
transit to come

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:90%
along and awaken that energy.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I like to say
when astrology opens a door

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:90%
for you, walk through it.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And doors, I really
connect them to transits.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Transits come in,
they open doors.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's great to
know your natal chart,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
but you really need
to get your chart

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:84%
done once a year because you
have so many new transits.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.045 align:middle line:90%
You really want to know what--

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:26.178 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: It's
changeable, isn't it?

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what are all
the doors opening?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:84%
When you give an astrological
reading to someone,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
how do they use it then
in their everyday life?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:90%
How do they apply it?

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, some people, they
want to know in a very--

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
they're reaching
higher consciousness,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and they really come
to me, and they say,

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make
the most of my chart.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And then that will
be a life direction.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of what I do is
very, it's always personal,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:90%
and it can be very practical.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it could be something
as simple as I had a client,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
she kept trying to go on a diet,
and her doctor even said you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:90%
really need to eat healthier.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And she was having a
lot of health concerns.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:90%
And she never had the willpower.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Every diet she started,
she couldn't stay on.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're very specific
transits that when Saturn comes

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:90%
in, Saturn is the teacher.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Saturn brings us discipline
to get something done,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish hard tasks.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to
find a Saturn transit

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.555 align:middle line:84%
that would be very supportive,
and so I could tell

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:90%
her we'll start your diet then.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Because she'd actually
tried to start her diet

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.890 align:middle line:84%
with the opposite kind
of transit, Jupiter,

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:90%
which expands everything.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter was on her Venus, which
just makes you want to indulge

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:90%
in all the earthly pleasures.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very hard to say
no to something with that.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So it can be very
specific and practical.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And then if you want to
know your life direction,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:90%
we can go that way, too.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Do you ever see
anything in a chart of a person

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.510 align:middle line:90%
that you won't tell them?

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.911 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well.
GEORGE: Anything bad?

00:03:56.911 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Death, something?
-Well, well, yes.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.131 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, when
it comes to death,

00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:06.700 align:middle line:84%
you have to be very
careful, because one, there

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:90%
are such things as miracles.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's just, how I would say
that, I would say well this

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
could be-- especially if
somebody comes and says

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:84%
my father's very, very
ill, and you know,

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen?

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.280 align:middle line:90%
When is he going to die?

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.329 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say,
only he knows that.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
We do have what I
can say is that these

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
are periods when the body
will be extremely stressed.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:90%
So be aware of that.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Do everything you can to stay
healthy and get your help.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Because it depends on how
much we want to incorporate

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
the medicine that the
doctor says, or how much

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.910 align:middle line:90%
we want to be here.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
How accurate is
astrology by the month?

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Like if you chart out somebody's
year, do you do it monthly

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:90%
or is it just out there?

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, I chart the whole year.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And there are long-term aspects
when the outer planets come in,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Pluto, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune,
when they make aspects,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
because they move
so slowly, they

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
set off a trigger in
the chart that then it's

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.651 align:middle line:84%
like they open a door that
stays open for several years

00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:84%
sometimes.
GEORGE: Oh, really.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:90%
That's a long time.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's some transits that
are saying, OK, transformation

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:84%
is coming into your
life and that we

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.960 align:middle line:90%
talk about the different ways.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And how we pinpoint it is
by the personal planets.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Then when you have the personal
planets make certain aspects,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:84%
it's going to activate the
energy the outer planet has

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:90%
brought in.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:84%
You've charted a
couple of world events

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:84%
that have occurred over
the past few months.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:90%
One being the hacking of Sony.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:90%
HEATHER: Yes.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
How did you do an astrological
chart on a company?

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, anything that has
a beginning has a chart.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And I actually work with
businesses on a regular basis.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:84%
People who want to start
businesses or people who want

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:84%
to relaunch their business,
helping them to come up

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
with-- you should
really choose the time

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
open your business,

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:90%
because that's a chart.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And just as natal charts,
just as people have transits,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:84%
the natal chart
will have transit,

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:84%
a business chart
will have transits.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And so you want to look ahead
to say-- because you don't

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.480 align:middle line:90%
want a lot of stress coming in.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:84%
You want the most
support possible.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So when I did the Sony chart,
it's a little complicated

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
when you're dealing
with Sony because it

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:84%
was Columbia Pictures, and then
Columbia Pictures was renamed.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:84%
When you start getting
these big corporations,

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:84%
oh, my gosh, it was
endless, the charts that you

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:90%
really have to look at.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.530 align:middle line:84%
However, the day and year
and month when Sony Pictures

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Entertainment was founded does
carry weight, enough weight

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.420 align:middle line:90%
that we can talk about it.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So well, what's
interesting when I

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:84%
look at this chart
in a business chart,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:90%
the sun is very important.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Now the sun is in
Leo in their chart,

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and that does rule entertainment
so that's wonderful.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:90%
That's a great sign.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.390 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: For them.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:90%
HEATHER: For them.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.900 align:middle line:84%
However, the sun is
afflicted in the natal chart.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
It's an extremely
afflicted natal chart.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.970 align:middle line:84%
The sun is in hard
aspect to Pluto.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.820 align:middle line:84%
That means it came in
under some possibly

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
shady circumstances or some
significant power plays.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:84%
You don't want a hard
aspect with Pluto

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:90%
in your business chart.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Now there was also Venus.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Venus is important
in a business chart

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:90%
because Venus rules money.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
In a natal chart, it can rule
money, love, as well as art.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
In a business chart,
it really tells me

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:84%
about money and
also relationships,

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.740 align:middle line:84%
the type of relationships
that they can form.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Venus was retrograde.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Now in a new company, Venus
in retrograde is terrible.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:84%
You really want the
energy going forward.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
However, because it
was being renamed,

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:84%
then it's OK that
it's a retrograde,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
but they still need to be very
careful about any contract they

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:90%
sign.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Anyone they deal with they have
to double, triple check it.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the moon, the moon is
the public in a business chart.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And in a natal chart,
if you're in the public,

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
the moon tells me how
well you'll be received.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:10%
In a business chart,
it says how does

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:10%
the public view this business?

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:10%
And the moon is very afflicted.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:10%
It's in an opposition,
the hardest aspect

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.390 align:middle line:10%
to both Uranus and Neptune.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.340 align:middle line:10%
And in a natal chart when
we see moon in Uranus

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:34.059 align:middle line:10%
on opposite sides, those
are emotional fluctuations.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Like, get
away from that?

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:84%
Even like a
psychiatric disorder.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
In a business chart, it means
they will come in and out

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.500 align:middle line:90%
of favor with the public.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.310 align:middle line:90%
It's the opposite of stability.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: All right, but does
the chart show that they

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.670 align:middle line:90%
were going to get hacked?

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and we do that--
that I was able to see

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:90%
by doing a current transit.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But we had to understand
the natal chart

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to see how the transits
are affecting it.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So a couple of things
that are going on.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:90%
They had a significant transit.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Pluto came in and
opposed the moon.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And Pluto, there's a high
road, low road of every planet.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And the low road of Pluto
represents our enemies,

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.670 align:middle line:84%
represents somebody
wanting revenge,

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.290 align:middle line:90%
represents power plays.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.116 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Ooh, and all
that sitting there.

00:09:22.116 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it was a
significant transit.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And really, Sony got hit
by the Uranus/Pluto square,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:84%
because the moon is in a
mid-degrees cardinal sign.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So every 50 years or so,
Uranus and Pluto in the sky,

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:90%
they form a square.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Normally, if we have a
transit from either one

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:84%
of those planets,
it's life altering.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So right now we've had a
lot of people and businesses

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.210 align:middle line:90%
with those degrees.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:84%
They're hit with
both at one time,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and this is when we really
see catastrophic events

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.364 align:middle line:84%
in the charts of
businesses and that.

00:09:54.364 --> 00:09:55.230 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Well, they got it.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:90%
The got hit big time.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they got hit.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Now also what's interesting,
Neptune-- Neptune

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.660 align:middle line:84%
is opposing their Mercury,
their planet of communication.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
That means even though-- what
that means, we don't really

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
have the whole story
yet, because Neptune

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.740 align:middle line:84%
can cast a veil of illusion
over anything it touches.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And Neptune, it's like seeing
through rose-colored glasses.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:84%
We think we were
seeing the truth,

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.800 align:middle line:90%
but you're not seeing the truth.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's affecting their
chart for an entire year.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going to really
know what truly happened

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.350 align:middle line:90%
until Neptune gets passed that.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
There's deception going
on within the company.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was surprised to
see that, because just

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
from what I had heard, I
expected to see the Pluto.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Because any time there's a major
power struggle or something

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.245 align:middle line:84%
like that, or a powerful
company-- Mussolini

00:10:55.245 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:84%
with Scorpio rising, Goring and
Goebbels had a lot of Scorpio

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:90%
and Pluto and Scorpio together.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So North Korea, I could
totally understand

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
plutonium energy coming
in and crushing something.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:84%
However, the Neptune
makes it more complicated.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:84%
They have people within
Sony that are deceptive.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Do they know that?

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Probably not, because
Neptune-- unless they--

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Call them.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'm sure they'll be
very happy to take that call.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: You have
deceptive people here.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.520 align:middle line:90%
So you have to be very careful.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at people
as on individual basis

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.290 align:middle line:90%
with astrology.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
How would you use it as a tool
for yourself, for example?

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my gosh, well, when
I started my business,

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I really looked at my
transits and I waited a year

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.720 align:middle line:84%
to officially launch my
company just so I would

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:90%
have the chart that I wanted.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So you had a chart that
you didn't like originally?

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, I wanted to start
my company, and so when

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.570 align:middle line:90%
I became serious about that--

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And that being
Arielle Astrology.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
That's right,
ARIELLESASTROLOGY.COM.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So when I started my company
I looked at my transits,

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and I sort of said,
OK, well, when

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the right
time, and I saw the windows,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of nice windows.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:84%
But I needed Arielle
to have a great chart.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:90%
It needed to be both.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.660 align:middle line:90%
And so it took 12 months.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Was it frustrating waiting?

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Not really, because
I know this works,

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't even an option.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And said, OK, well,
that's the deal.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the way
it's going to be.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the way
it's going to be.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.511 align:middle line:84%
Would it be the same
in a relationship?

00:12:33.511 --> 00:12:34.210 align:middle line:90%
In what way?

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:84%
What if a couple
wants to get married?

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Would you tell them--

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:37.990 align:middle line:90%
HEATHER: Oh, absolutely.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:90%
You'd better wait a year.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well--

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.844 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: And they're
going to say, what?

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I know, and then they're going
to say, but you know what?

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:90%
A lot of weddings, they do.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.610 align:middle line:84%
They get engaged and
they do wait a year.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So but, yes, a
wedding chart is very

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.420 align:middle line:84%
important, because
that wedding chart

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:90%
is going to have transits.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And often when Uranus, which is
the Great Awakener, it comes in

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and it just, like a
bolt of lightning,

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:84%
eliminates things and
people from our life.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And often when Uranus opposes
the ascendant in a wedding

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:90%
chart, people divorce.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want--
you want to be

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:13.450 align:middle line:84%
as sturdy in that relationship,
as stable in that relationship,

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:84%
as possible before
you have that transit.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Would you see blips
in somebody's chart,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.910 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship chart, that
looks great, but that you see

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:84%
five years, 10
years down the line,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have a problem?

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Will you see that
from the outset?

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Oh, absolutely, but what I
see are we all have challenges.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:37.020 align:middle line:84%
We all have obstacles,
but they're also always,

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:84%
there's always the
energy coming in.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And as long as we embrace our
free will and have awareness,

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:90%
we can always overcome them.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it
takes a lot more

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:90%
effort with a difficult aspect.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:90%
But it is good to say,

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, with Saturn--
Saturn is the cosmic paycheck.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Astrologer Grant Lewi said that.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And it really,
every seven years,

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.530 align:middle line:90%
we have a check in with Saturn.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And if we work very hard,
Saturn values consistent effort

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:90%
and above-board effort.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And so every seven years
I can say, OK, you've

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:84%
got seven years now to
live this way if you do it

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.090 align:middle line:84%
when you have that next
aspect from Saturn,

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:90%
you are guaranteed rewards.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:21.100 align:middle line:84%
However, if you take shortcuts,
if your effort is inconsistent,

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.350 align:middle line:84%
even if it's really not
your fault-- some people--

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.530 align:middle line:84%
someone gets sick,
you can't do your job,

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and it's inconsistent.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:10%
You spend half
your time-- there's

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:10%
nothing wrong with that, but
understand that the effect will

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:10%
be inconsistent.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:10%
So in that way I try to prepare
my clients as much as possible.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the energy
that's coming in then,

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.110 align:middle line:90%
and these are some real markers.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
This is how to handle
that energy to maximate.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
The goal is always to activate
the highest potential,

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.740 align:middle line:90%
which anyone can do.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: What can go wrong
in an astrological chart?

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Anything?

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:90%
What can go wrong?

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, there can be afflictions.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, when
people experience

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:84%
serious illnesses
and things like that.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.680 align:middle line:84%
They're clear in
the natal chart.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And some people are born
with real accident aspects.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And what happens,
is that they're

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
going to be-- it's a
greater possibility for them

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:84%
to have a serious accident, say
skiing or something like that.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that a
transit will activate, open

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that door, and there will
be very specific times when

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:90%
it's particularly dangerous.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And I will just be
honest and say, OK,

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.670 align:middle line:84%
this is the time for
these few months,

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:90%
really, don't go skiing.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, don't ride your
motorcycle right now.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Just wait until this
door closes, because it

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:90%
suggested in the natal chart.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:39.581 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
window there thaT--

00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:90%
HEATHER: Absolutely.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:84%
People should
look at, and maybe

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:90%
hold back for a little bit.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:90%
HEATHER: Absolutely.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why transits are
really the cornerstone.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
They're the
cornerstone of change.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Interesting.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.651 align:middle line:84%
You also looked at the chart of
that disaster in the Ukraine.

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:84%
HEATHER: Right.
-The plane that went down.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:84%
The Ukraine air disaster, yeah,
I study accident charts a lot.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is called
an event chart.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So any time something like that
happens, it's an event chart

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:90%
and you put it together.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Now in a flight chart
Uranus rules flight,

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:84%
so you always want
to look at Uranus

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and make sure you want to
have nice harmonious aspects.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Mars is critical in
any accident chart.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Mars is violence.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And then Uranus,
that's explosive.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So Mars and Uranus working
together, because Uranus rules

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:84%
technology, you have the
energy to successfully

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.560 align:middle line:90%
maneuver the technology.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:84%
In a hard aspects, it's
the classic accent aspect,

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.070 align:middle line:90%
and it can have explosions.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a lot going
on in this accident chart.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's also, you have to
say, well, in the sky that day,

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were a lot of
planes that took off that day.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Oh, every day.
-Yes, every day.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And the day that this
accident happened,

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:84%
there were lots of
plans that took off,

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and every plane that took off
this day had an afflicted Mars.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Mars was incredibly afflicted.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:90%
It was opposing Uranus.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Could it
happen to any of them?

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.406 align:middle line:84%
It was, well, I'll tell you
why it happened to this one.

00:17:02.406 --> 00:17:06.160 align:middle line:84%
It does create more
incendiary, in general, it

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
does create a higher
potential, but it is

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:90%
activated by the specific time.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Because it depends on the
houses, where they are.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:10%
So in this case, and Mars was
squaring the sun, what happened

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.530 align:middle line:10%
is that Mars ended up
at the top of the chart

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:10%
the most public place,
conjuncted a prenatal eclipse

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:10%
and a North Node.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And the North Node is the
destiny of the flight.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't want the destiny
of your flight to be public,

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
because that means
something's going

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.580 align:middle line:84%
to happen to it, that it's
going to be in the news.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Mars was squaring
the sun, the health

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
of the flight in the house
of death, opposing Uranus.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth house is very
significant in accident charts,

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
because that represents
the end of the matter.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And what did you look
at, the flight number?

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:90%
How do you pick that plane?

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, well, you
have to go, I mean,

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
you have to make a chart of
the time that they took off.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the time
that they took off

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:04.110 align:middle line:90%
sets everything into motion.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: OK, but you have to
have that specific flight?

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you have to have that
specific-- it was 6:15

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:90%
PM when they actually took off.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:90%
And the moon was an Aries.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Mars was very active.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Moon in Aries because Mars
rules Aries, applying to Uranus.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And so it was explosive
qualities all over the chart.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
timing, they all

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:90%
ended up on the wrong angles.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why it
was this time, even

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:84%
though other flights-- because
if they're in other houses,

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that could just mean,
oh, there could've been

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:90%
an altercation on a flight.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Or that could've been a day when
there was a lot of turbulence,

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and that it would've been
represented on all the flights

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:84%
but not as in a
catastrophic explosion.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
That is because of the
timing and the angles.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was doomed
from the get-go?

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a really terrible,
terrible chart.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's-- I talked
to an astrologer.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.574 align:middle line:84%
I actually talked to Mary
Keswani, and I asked her,

00:19:06.574 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:90%
what do you think of this chart?

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah, I would
not have been on that plane.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Wow.
-It's very classic.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Now if you take the missing
Malaysian plane 370--

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:84%
HEATHER: Yes, I
looked at that chart.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:90%
That looked bad, too.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:84%
It did, and what's interesting
about the ending, so

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:84%
the fourth house, the
end of the matter,

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, in the Ukraine
crash it was Mars.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's explosive,
Mars and Uranus.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.230 align:middle line:84%
The Malaysian had
Pisces down there.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: They can't find it.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:10%
I know, and Neptune
was on the cusp.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:10%
Neptune makes things disappear.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:10%
You can't see things.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:10%
It casts that veil of illusion.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle line:10%
It's very hard to know
what happened to it.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So you really don't want
planets in the fourth house,

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
difficult planets in the
fourth house of a plane chart,

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:84%
because that's telling you how
this thing is going to end.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:90%
So that was the most striking.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And also, Neptune
made hard aspects

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.130 align:middle line:84%
to the health of the flight,
not only when they took off,

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.090 align:middle line:90%
but also where they were going.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Well, because we don't
know where that flight is,

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
we don't know where that
plane is, do the charts

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:90%
point out something strange?

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, the fact that
Neptune is down there

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:84%
is saying this is
really camouflaged.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And what's going to happen is
that as that accident chart has

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:84%
transits, there will be-- and
I haven't activated that chart,

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.440 align:middle line:84%
but if you activate
it, you'll find Windows

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:90%
where clarity can come in.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.490 align:middle line:84%
That if they do an
investigation at a certain time,

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
it will help them
to uncover answers.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
All right, someone wants
to better themselves.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:90%
They want to lose weight.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.950 align:middle line:90%
They want a better job.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.300 align:middle line:84%
How do they use
astrology to do that?

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, they find
out their transits.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.640 align:middle line:84%
They find out which
doors are open to them,

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and when are they open, so then
they can make a greater effort,

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:84%
use their awareness, become
aware of all of this,

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and make an effort to
walk through that door.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
it's very frightening

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:90%
to do something different.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:84%
People look through the
door, but they sort of

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle line:84%
need a nudge sometimes
to walk through,

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.350 align:middle line:84%
embrace what's on
the other side.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:84%
That energy is coming in to
help you experience something

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:84%
new that then is
going to allow you

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.090 align:middle line:90%
to go through the next door.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.646 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes people, you
have six doors, five are open,

00:21:21.646 --> 00:21:23.290 align:middle line:84%
one is closed.
GEORGE: Open them all.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you want to go
to one that's closed.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And really, you
need to experience

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
what's on the other
side of the other doors.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the energy
shifts in that door

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that you so wanted
to go through opens.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And now you're ready
to go through it.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's why
astrology's about timing.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Who's is more apt to use
astrology, a woman or a man?

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I have all
ages, both sexes.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:84%
It's really, no, a lot
of men use astrology.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
use astrology.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that a
lot of prominent people

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:90%
use astrology, however--

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:90%
That nobody knows about, right?

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Because they want it
to be a secret because,

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
of course, they don't
want to be ostracized.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
There's opposition to
astrology, but very

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.987 align:middle line:84%
powerful people use astrology,
people of all walks of life.

00:22:12.987 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:90%
The Reagans used it, right?

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.410 align:middle line:90%
HEATHER: Absolutely.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:84%
How does religion
view astrology.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Any guide that helps you
reach higher consciousness

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and reach your full
potential is positive.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:84%
But I would guess
most mainstream

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.685 align:middle line:90%
religions would be opposed.

00:22:28.685 --> 00:22:29.385 align:middle line:90%
Yes yes.

00:22:29.385 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I have found that
to be the case.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.835 align:middle line:90%
Now, are you a believer in God?

00:22:33.835 --> 00:22:35.230 align:middle line:90%
HEATHER: Yes.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Was this difficult for you
to become an astrologer?

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Did you fight yourself at all?

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.360 align:middle line:84%
No, it really wasn't, because
I just know these are symbols.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:84%
These are symbols that
it's a way to communicate

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:90%
with us and a way to help us.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a language, and there are
many ways that it speaks to me.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Numerology speaks
to someone else.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:90%
There are many ways.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
What do you like
about astrology?

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Astrology helps you
reach your full potential.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.340 align:middle line:84%
It gives you that
life direction,

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and it constantly reminds
you of the duality

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that exists within all of
us, within every planet.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's not faded.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:90%
We have free will.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:90%
We have control.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And we can activate that,
so it's very empowering.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's go very quickly
through the astrological chart

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and give me a 30 second,
who is this person?

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:90%
What's January is one.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK OK.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:90%
So January's Capricorn.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:90%
It really starts with Aries.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:90%
The Zodiac starts with Aries.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And 0 degrees Aries
brings in spring.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And all the cardinal signs,
Aries, Cancer, Capricorn,

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Libra, anything that
starts a season,

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:90%
it's all about new beginnings.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people
with Cardinal energy

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:90%
are great self-starters.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:84%
They're great with that
individual initiative.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's the Aries,
Cancer, Libra.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.490 align:middle line:90%
All right, then we may repeat.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Folks born in February.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.470 align:middle line:84%
February, and then we go
in-- so Capricorn in January,

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.525 align:middle line:90%
then we move into Aquarius.

00:24:12.525 --> 00:24:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And Aquarius is very--
that's Uranus rules Aquarius.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:84%
It's very much the
sign of the rebel.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:90%
So you're going to go against.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.445 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have the power
to go against convention.

00:24:22.445 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I have a daughter
who's an Aquarius.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:90%
She's a rebel.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I always say,
activate the high potential, be

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:84%
a rebel with a
cause, because it's

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.860 align:middle line:90%
great for humanitarian reform.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Don't be a rebel
without a cause and just

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:90%
go against things and people.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.820 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: James Dean.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.182 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:38.182 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:90%
March.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So then we go into Pisces,
and Pisces is receptive,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:90%
it's sensitive.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
It's great for music, for
art, for anything creative.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Creative people.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.980 align:middle line:90%
For anything self-transcendent.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.190 align:middle line:84%
If you really want to
retire consciousness,

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:56.370 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy to
meditate and transcend.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a desire
to escape reality.

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So Piscean people usually
have a great fantasy life.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.330 align:middle line:84%
They have a great
imagination, because there's

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.880 align:middle line:84%
a desire to not
just live in what

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.295 align:middle line:90%
they consider to be reality.

00:25:11.295 --> 00:25:12.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's rattle them off.
April.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, then from Pisces,
we do into Aries.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.840 align:middle line:84%
That's that
individual initiative.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.390 align:middle line:90%
It's ruled by Mars.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Aries can be very pioneering,
because they like to be first.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And they've got that energy
to get something done.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So Steve Jobs was an
Aries, had strong Aries.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: May.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Then we go into Taurus.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Torres is of the
earth, it's grounded.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:84%
A boulder, actually,
has a Taurean ascendant.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.240 align:middle line:90%
It's stable.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It's also, usually if
you have Taurus energy,

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.310 align:middle line:90%
you like the earth.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:84%
You like being here,
because it enhances

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:90%
earthly pleasures, the senses.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.560 align:middle line:90%
June we've done.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.452 align:middle line:90%
Gemini.

00:25:49.452 --> 00:25:50.344 align:middle line:90%
July.

00:25:50.344 --> 00:25:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Cancer, we've not
talked about Cancer.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is reflective.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:84%
It rules the house that
rules past experiences

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and past life experiences.
It's connected--

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.190 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: I like that.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's connected to family.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.450 align:middle line:90%
It's very personal.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It can be very sensitive.
It's water.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Any time you have water in your
chart, you can over absorb.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's like
with Pisces, too.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So you always want to
be careful because you

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.270 align:middle line:90%
absorb your surroundings.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%
I always say to water signs,
don't forget to every once

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:90%
in a while ring yourself out.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Because you're like
a sponge, and you're

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:90%
just taking in too much.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:90%
August.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Then we get into
Leo, fiery Leo.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the sign of the
star, the performer,

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:84%
people who can
get up-- it's also

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:84%
the sign of the cheerleader
in the most optimistic way.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.800 align:middle line:90%
Leo's inspire.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.341 align:middle line:84%
They have charisma
and enthusiasm.

00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Perfect.
September.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh, then Virgo.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Virgos like to be of service.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And Virgo is-- they don't have
to be the center of attention.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to get
that public recognition,

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
but they want to make a
significant contribution.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And they're great at being--
they can be perfectionists,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and if it goes too far,
they can be hypochondriacs.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Because there's that very
detailed mind, and they're

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:90%
great at seeing details.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:05.200 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: October.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Then Libra.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Libra's all about when you
think of the scales, equality.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.570 align:middle line:90%
There's a desire for equality.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi, Jimmy Carter
has a lot of Libra.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi had Libra,
Jimmy Carter has Libra.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a desire for things
to be fair and balanced.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.950 align:middle line:84%
The downside of Libra
is that sometimes

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:23.530 align:middle line:84%
if things aren't beautiful,
they turn the other way.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So it can be the Ostrich,
the head in the sand,

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:90%
if things get too dark.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:90%
November.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:84%
As they do when we get
to November and Scorpio.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Pluto rules Scorpio, and
it's the most intense sign.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:84%
The theme is transformation,
and death, and rebirth.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Think of the Phoenix
rising from the flame.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So if have Scorpio,
if you have Pluto,

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:46.170 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you
encounter in life,

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and you will come
face to face with some

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:84%
difficult experiences,
you have the power

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.460 align:middle line:90%
to rejuvenate and regenerate.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.700 align:middle line:90%
You can always be reborn.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And you must always
keep that in mind.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Lastly, December.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.880 align:middle line:90%
And December is Sagittarius.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.010 align:middle line:10%
Sagittarius is also fiery.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:04.720 align:middle line:10%
It's fun.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:10%
Sages are the life of the
party, and they like freedom.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.170 align:middle line:10%
It's similar to
Gemini in that Geminis

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:10%
like freedom of the mind.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:15.760 align:middle line:10%
Sages freedom, they're great
travelers, because they

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.370 align:middle line:10%
like freedom of the landscape.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So they always want
to see new places.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.320 align:middle line:90%
I love it.
