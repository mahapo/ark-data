>>GEORGE NOORY: Mankind has been
obsessed with trying to find

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis, that very romantic,
mythical place-- maybe?--

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that Plato wrote about
many, many years ago.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's check in with
our special guest.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>Using Plato's description,
some clever deduction,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of modern
technology, he's

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.540 align:middle line:84%
hunting for the lost
city of Atlantis.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:10%
In "Meet Me in Atlantis,"
travel writer Mark Adams charts

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:10%
of course similar to
his New York Times

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:10%
best seller "Turn
Right at Machu Picchu."

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
His adventure
started as an effort

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
to understand why
amateur explorers seek

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:90%
places that may never be found.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:84%
As he crisscrossed the
globe, his interest

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
turned to obsession for
one of those places--

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:84%
the lost city that
has eluded so many.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Adams reveals what's known and
unknown about the sunken city

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.409 align:middle line:90%
today on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Mark Adams
believes that there

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.516 align:middle line:84%
might be four
locations for Atlantis,

00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to talk about all

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:90%
of those on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And Mark, welcome
to the program.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you with us.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK ADAMS: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Really
excited about this.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:10%
I have been fascinated
with Atlantis

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:10%
since I was a boy, just trying
to figure out where in the heck

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:10%
is this place and
what happened to it.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So we'll talk about these
various theories about this.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
But when everybody says
you're obsessed with this,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:90%
what do they mean by that?

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.270 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Well, I'm a reporter.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:10%
Usually what happens
with Atlantis is someone

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:10%
will come up with
an idea that they've

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:10%
decided they know where it was.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.939 align:middle line:10%
And then they go and they
construct this theory

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:10%
based on little bits
of evidence they

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:10%
find here and there
to prove this idea

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:10%
that they've already
come up with.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
My obsession was to try to
find out once and for all

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.340 align:middle line:84%
whether Atlantis was
real, and if it was real,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.490 align:middle line:90%
where was it located.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So I went all the way back to
the original source material

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.252 align:middle line:84%
and spent about three years
traveling around the world,

00:02:11.252 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out what the
truth was about Atlantis.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back to
the story created by Plato.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:90%
What did he say?

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, every
shred of reliable evidence

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:84%
that we have for Atlantis
comes from Plato.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Two dialogues that he
wrote around 360 BC.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he says Atlantis
was a pretty advanced Maritime

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
culture that existed opposite
the Pillars of Hercules, that

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
was destroyed in a
fearful day and a night

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:84%
by earthquakes and floods,
and that is no longer exists.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:90%
They were in a war with Athens.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the half of the story
that people usually leave out.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.097 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you have to
look at all the other bits

00:02:56.097 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:90%
and pieces of information.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts of
numbers and locations

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.659 align:middle line:84%
in the original Atlanta
story that Plato gives.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
start the weigh these

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:84%
to see which of them did he
mean to be taken as fiction,

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and which of them did he
mean to be taken as reality.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it an island?

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Was it a huge continent?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.993 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: It was not a continent.

00:03:14.993 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:10%
It was, he says, an island
that had a central capital

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.900 align:middle line:10%
city that consisted of rings
of land and water-- concentric

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:10%
circles.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.658 align:middle line:10%
That would be one of the
things that you really

00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:29.729 align:middle line:10%
have to find if you
wanted to find Atlantis.

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.270 align:middle line:84%
The continent thing
is something that

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
came up in the 19th century,
which is when people really

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.587 align:middle line:84%
started to think about
searching for Atlantis for real.

00:03:37.587 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you were going
to search for Atlantis,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
you'd be looking
for an island city

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
somewhere opposite the
Pillars of Hercules.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it was
generally in that region?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: People have
placed Atlantis in Bolivia,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
people placed Atlantis Cuba,
famously near the Bahamas.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Some people said
it's in Indonesia.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any
sense that Atlantis

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
would exist anywhere
that isn't somewhere

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:90%
near the Mediterranean.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.590 align:middle line:84%
They're in a naval battle
with Athens in this story.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
No one is going to
bring a Navy all the way

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.302 align:middle line:84%
from Bolivia to Athens to attack
them in prehistoric Greece.

00:04:16.302 --> 00:04:18.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just not going to
happen, so it almost certainly

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.093 align:middle line:84%
has to be in the
Mediterranean region.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And luck would
have it for the Greeks

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:84%
that something would
happen to Atlantis.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Well, yes.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But what people forget sometimes
is that these earthquakes

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and floods, they
destroyed Atlantis.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And depending on how
you read the story,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.410 align:middle line:84%
they probably destroyed
Athens as well.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, these
earthquakes, were they natural,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.904 align:middle line:90%
or were they created by man?

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: He doesn't specify.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He doesn't know that?

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.816 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: He doesn't specify.

00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:45.930 align:middle line:84%
He says it was a
day and a night.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
The island went
beneath the waves.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.080 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't say it fell to the
bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.970 align:middle line:84%
He says it went
beneath the waves.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So to me, looking at the
geophysical evidence,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that sounds a lot more
like an earthquake

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.580 align:middle line:84%
followed by a tsunami, which
quite frequently happens.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A big one.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: A big tsunami, right.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:10%
And there is evidence
in several locations

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.980 align:middle line:10%
around the Mediterranean
that this sort of thing

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:10%
happened in antiquity.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.214 align:middle line:84%
So I think that is
the most likely case

00:05:12.214 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
for what happened in the sinking
of whatever was Atlantis.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When he talks about
the civilization was advanced,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:84%
romantically, we all like to
think that the Atlanteans had

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.220 align:middle line:84%
flying machines,
and high technology,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and some crystal apparatus
that energized the area.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.955 align:middle line:84%
You hear about
these crystals, you

00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:84%
hear about these
flying machines.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally you hear about
bubble cities and nuclear power

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
All of that stuff was
invented in the 19th and early

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.580 align:middle line:90%
20th century.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
What Plato says--
what I think he

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:84%
says that indicates that if the
story is real-- that they were

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:84%
technologically
advanced was they'd

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:84%
dig these enormous
canals that he mentions.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Not just those circular
ones around the city,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
but this enormous
canal around a plane

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.364 align:middle line:84%
that would be more than 1,000
miles long, if it were real.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is big.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Which is
big, if it's true.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:84%
But there's this problem
with numbers in Plato,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:84%
whether he intended them
to be taken literally,

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:84%
or whether he was using them
as symbols of something else.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without
Plato's description,

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:84%
would we know anything
about Atlantis?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: No, because what Plato
says in the story-- he says,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.190 align:middle line:90%
I got the story.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.940 align:middle line:10%
Well, Socrates
introduces the character

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.550 align:middle line:10%
who tells the story, Critias.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.307 align:middle line:84%
And Critias says,
I got this story

00:06:34.307 --> 00:06:35.890 align:middle line:84%
from my great, great,
great, great-- I

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
think it is--
grandfather Solon, who

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
is a real historic
figure-- lived

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:84%
around 600 BC-- who we believe
actually did go to Egypt.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, the story he heard
was that Solon went to Egypt.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:84%
He went to a temple,
and one of the priests

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
there told him the
story of Atlantis.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is our sole source for
the information about Atlantis.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.537 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nowadays we just put
it on Facebook and Twitter.

00:06:59.537 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Exactly, exactly.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%
But what Critias says was
the priest told Solon, look,

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to change all
the names in this story

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.170 align:middle line:90%
into Greek for you.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So the one thing we know
about whatever Atlantis

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.220 align:middle line:84%
was, whether it was real
or not, was that it was not

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:90%
called Atlantis.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So any theory that it's based
on-- this ancient language

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
has a word that sounds
kind of like Atlantis,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.399 align:middle line:84%
well, that's the only
place it could not be,

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
because we know it was
not called Atlantis.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going to talk
about four specific locations

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
that you think Atlantis
might have been

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and talk about, of
course, where we would

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:90%
go to see if we could find it.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But why did they have
such a difficult time

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:84%
pinpointing where it was
for us in this story?

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Why does
the evidence not

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:90%
point to a specific location?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Then.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.650 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Then?

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Then.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.880 align:middle line:10%
When they were telling the story
to Plato, when he picked it up,

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.001 align:middle line:10%
why didn't they also
have a location for him?

00:07:52.001 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, the
interesting thing

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.709 align:middle line:84%
is they do give
geographic details that,

00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient world,
would have made some sense.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:84%
He says it's opposite
the Pillars of Hercules--

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:84%
or Heracles, as the Greeks
would have called it-- which

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:84%
is usually interpreted as
the pillars at Gibraltar,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.152 align:middle line:84%
and there's one in
Morocco as well.

00:08:11.152 --> 00:08:12.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These were
man-made pillars, right?

00:08:12.985 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No, no, no.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No?

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: The Rock of
Gibraltar is 1,400 feet tall.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Imagine being--

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they
mean by "the pillars of"?

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: The term means-- it's
like a symbolic spot where,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.360 align:middle line:10%
using Greek mythology,
supposedly Hercules threw

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.579 align:middle line:10%
the pillar at Gibraltar
there as a marker back

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:37.120 align:middle line:10%
when he was performing
at the labors.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But natural?

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.276 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yeah, but
natural, right.

00:08:39.276 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:10%
This was an explanation
for why you get to the end

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:10%
of the Mediterranean, and at
the mouth of the Mediterranean

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:10%
you've got beaches,
and then boom,

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.726 align:middle line:10%
all of a sudden you've got
this 1,400-foot slab of rock.

00:08:50.726 --> 00:08:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Which, if you ever visit,
is absolutely incredible.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing one of
the wonders the world.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing he
says is it was near a place

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:90%
called Gades.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, "Gades" is an
old Phoenician term

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
that I think means
enclosed city.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And that is how the modern
city of Cadiz in southern Spain

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:90%
got its name.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:84%
It was actually called
Gadira, I think, or Gades.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So that would seem to be
a pretty strong indication

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.130 align:middle line:84%
that southern Spain is a good
place to look for Atlantis,

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:90%
if it really did exist.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:31.470 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a city called
Agadir in Morocco to the south.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Agadir, the root word
is also Gadira or Gades.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's outside the
Pillars of Hercules,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:90%
and it's got the same root word.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So that could also
be a candidate.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right,
well, let's talk

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.680 align:middle line:10%
about some of these four
specific locations, Mark,

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.660 align:middle line:10%
and then we'll pinpoint
some of these things

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:10%
and get your opinion on
where you think it might be.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:10%
And let's talk about Gibraltar
first as a possibility.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:56.512 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Gibraltar is the
classic clue that Plato gave,

00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's the one
that most people know.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:84%
You know the three
big clues are Pillars

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:84%
of Hercules, sank beneath the
water, and concentric circles.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:84%
So Gibraltar, A, number one,
everybody knows what it is.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe
that when Plato

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:84%
wrote about the
Pillars of Hercules,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:84%
he meant at Gibraltar,
then a candidate

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
just outside the mouth
of the Mediterranean

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:90%
makes a lot of sense.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.295 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
lot of people who

00:10:20.295 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:84%
think that southern Spain,
where they have found evidence

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:84%
of an old civilization
there, and there's also

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.287 align:middle line:84%
another city that was lost
there called Tartessos, which

00:10:28.287 --> 00:10:30.120 align:middle line:84%
is generally believed
to be real and appears

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.546 align:middle line:90%
in other ancient sources.

00:10:31.546 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps those two cities
were the same thing.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.305 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the city of
Atlantis was actually

00:10:35.305 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:84%
the city of Tartessos
under a different name.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
you rate Gibraltar

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
as the possible
location for Atlantis?

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I would say
just outside Gibraltar

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:84%
in an area that's now called
Donana National Park is

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.030 align:middle line:90%
a very strong candidate.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.364 align:middle line:84%
If Atlantis turns out you
have been real to some degree,

00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:51.488 align:middle line:84%
I would say that is one of
the stronger candidates.

00:10:51.488 --> 00:10:52.687 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give me a percent.

00:10:52.687 --> 00:10:54.520 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I can't give
you a percent, George.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:10%
I don't have any
data to work with.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 80%?

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.530 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: But I'll give you
a percent about something

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.330 align:middle line:10%
else in a minute.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.490 align:middle line:90%
What is the next candidate?

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our next
candidate is Malta.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Malta.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Malta is probably the
oldest-known Maritime culture

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.220 align:middle line:90%
in the Mediterranean.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
We know that it was once
completely wiped out--

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:84%
the entire population-- by
some sort of watery disaster.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:84%
It has temples that
are 1,000 years older

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
than even the great
pyramids of Egypt,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.747 align:middle line:84%
and Plato writes about
these incredible temples

00:11:27.747 --> 00:11:28.830 align:middle line:90%
on the island of Atlantis.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.288 align:middle line:84%
Malta, for anyone
who doesn't know,

00:11:30.288 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:84%
is an island just off of
the southern part of Italy.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And Malta also
has what are known

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.540 align:middle line:84%
as Cart Ruts, which of
these mysterious grooves

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.375 align:middle line:90%
dug into the rock of Malta.

00:11:44.375 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
You can see them in
the picture there.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And Plato wrote about this
plane with these canals

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.510 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about
earlier, and some people

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.772 align:middle line:84%
believe that these Cart
Ruts with the canals

00:11:54.772 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:90%
that Plato was talking about.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.267 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of both
geological and archaeological

00:12:00.267 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:84%
information that would
indicate that Malta's

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:90%
a pretty good candidate.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Island
of Santorini.

00:12:05.045 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: The Island
of Santorini,

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:84%
which is academia's
favorite, because there's

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what they were consider
solid archaeological evidence

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.398 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I keep hearing
that name pop up.

00:12:15.398 --> 00:12:18.487 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Yeah, it's the one-- if
you ever watch a special on TV,

00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
there's a nine out of 10 chance
that their conclusion is going

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.062 align:middle line:90%
to be Atlantis was Santorini.

00:12:23.062 --> 00:12:24.520 align:middle line:84%
The reason for that
is that we know

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:84%
there was a huge volcanic
explosion around 1,600 BC

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:90%
called the Thera explosion.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And a sort of pre-Greek
civilization blew sky high.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:84%
It caused a tsunami
that affected

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:84%
much of the eastern
Mediterranean, wiped

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:90%
out other cities on the coast.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And most of all,
when it was done,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.690 align:middle line:84%
it was left with this
circular caldera, which,

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:84%
if you visit there now,
is a circular caldera

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.150 align:middle line:84%
with a little island
in the middle.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:57.155 align:middle line:84%
So it echoes that sort
of concentric circle

00:12:57.155 --> 00:12:59.030 align:middle line:84%
look that's one of the
primary clues of where

00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.990 align:middle line:90%
to find Atlantis.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the last location,
Morocco's Atlantic Coast.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, here's where we
can put a percentage on this,

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.830 align:middle line:84%
because I found the
IT specialist in Bonn,

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Germany, who took the 51 clues
from Plato's two dialogues,

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:84%
plugged them into an algorithm--
51 geographic clues--

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and came up with the
Souss-Massa Plane

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:84%
on the Atlantic Coast of
Morocco near the city of Agadir.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And he took me out there,
and it's pretty impressive.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
There is a circular formation
which-- can't really

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:84%
notice until you-- it
looks great on Google Maps,

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.960 align:middle line:90%
it's sort of a doughnut shape.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you stand above it
and you look into the middle,

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.854 align:middle line:84%
there are some sort of
ruins there in the center.

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:43.520 align:middle line:84%
There may have been
a civilization there

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.478 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago.

00:13:44.478 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it possible that
each four of these locations

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
might have had
civilizations there that

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.389 align:middle line:90%
went down from some calamity?

00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I would
say almost certainly

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.880 align:middle line:84%
all four had civilizations
that disappeared

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.980 align:middle line:84%
at some point for reasons
we don't fully understand.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The technology
that they might have had.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Overinflated?

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I think people tend
to think that Atlantis

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.900 align:middle line:84%
was some sort of super city that
you would see out of Star Wars.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: An advanced
civilization.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: They had laser
guns and cancer cures.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That they might even
have been extraterrestrials,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:16.650 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:17.816 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: They might've been.

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:21.010 align:middle line:90%
I've heard that theory as well.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:84%
It's talk like that that is
what makes it so difficult

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:90%
to take Atlantis seriously.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've got a
story here that comes

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
from the most
influential philosopher

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
in Western civilization,
and yet you're really not

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:84%
allowed to talk about it
in academia because there's

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:84%
all this kind of outlandish talk
about technologically advanced

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.500 align:middle line:90%
aliens and things like that.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of gets
away from essentially

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:84%
what is a treasure map
that Plato gave us.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:84%
He gave us dozens and
dozens of interesting clues,

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and if we get sidetracked on
this technology, for which

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
there is absolutely no
evidence whatsoever,

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:84%
then we miss the really
good Indiana Jones

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.125 align:middle line:90%
story that's in there.

00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right under our nose.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
at what archaeologists

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:90%
are saying about Atlantis.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:10%
>>Marine archaeologist
Claudio Lozano and Morales

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.760 align:middle line:10%
are equipped with the
latest in sonar technology.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.590 align:middle line:10%
The torpedo-shaped towfish
generates sound waves

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:10%
that bounce off the sea floor.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:10%
When the signals
return, they're received

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:10%
by a computer on
deck that converts

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:10%
the sound waves into images.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:10%
Any formation that appears
in the sonar imaging system

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:10%
is mapped and its
coordinates recorded.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:10%
>>We have seen an anomaly,
which is a vertical wall.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.226 align:middle line:10%
This is very different to
a geological formation.

00:15:49.226 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:10%
>>Magnifico.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:10%
>>It is a vertical structure.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:10%
>>Right now, we've
found an anomaly

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.100 align:middle line:10%
that is not geological at all.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:10%
It's very big, it's very high.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:10%
>>Two walls-- one, two.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.145 align:middle line:10%
Completely vertical.

00:16:05.145 --> 00:16:06.810 align:middle line:10%
It's very nice.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:10%
>>And the shape is not natural.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.954 align:middle line:10%
>>It's attractive.

00:16:10.954 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
Mark, a little clip

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.740 align:middle line:84%
on just what archaeologists
use to try to find things.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:84%
How deep is the water in
these locations that we just

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:20.416 align:middle line:90%
talked about?

00:16:20.416 --> 00:16:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Most of them
are right on the coast,

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:23.748 align:middle line:84%
and I think it
makes a lot of sense

00:16:23.748 --> 00:16:25.889 align:middle line:84%
to look for Atlantis
right on the coast

00:16:25.889 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:90%
around the Mediterranean.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Because if it was an earthquake
followed by a tsunami

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:84%
situation, we're
probably not talking

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:84%
about thousands and thousands
of feet beneath the water.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.699 align:middle line:84%
It's probably dozens, or maybe
100 or a couple hundred feet.

00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That wouldn't be
too hard to find, then.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It wouldn't
be too hard to find.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.060 align:middle line:84%
But the technology
that we have now known,

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:52.069 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the
Atlanteans, can see things.

00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I met the guys who
found the Titanic,

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and they told me
they had cameras

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.810 align:middle line:84%
they could see a cinder block
under the ocean from a mile

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:84%
They're using things like lidar
in the jungles of Honduras,

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and they just found a couple
years ago this White City

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:84%
that people have been looking
since the Spanish conquistadors

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.602 align:middle line:90%
showed up 500 years ago.

00:17:09.602 --> 00:17:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So the technology we
have-- and this has really

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:84%
powered the people looking
for Atlantis at home.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
Things like Google Earth and
the satellite images that were

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:90%
never available in the past.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.967 align:middle line:84%
People can do serious
work looking for Atlantis

00:17:23.967 --> 00:17:25.800 align:middle line:84%
from the comfort of
their own home nowadays.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.216 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
we think happened

00:17:27.216 --> 00:17:28.508 align:middle line:90%
to the inhabitants of Atlantis?

00:17:28.508 --> 00:17:29.382 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Of Atlantis?

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
all die immediately?

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.134 align:middle line:90%
What do you think happened?

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Speculation.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: My reading of what
Plato said-- and it's really

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:90%
very vague.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what you have to do
with Plato's interpret very

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.949 align:middle line:84%
vague statements-- is that
everybody was wiped out.

00:17:42.949 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Wiped out from the
face of the earth,

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and that it was
punishment from the gods.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.910 align:middle line:84%
I think stories and say
the Atlanteans got in boats

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and went off and founded
civilizations elsewhere,

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I just don't see any
evidence for that.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might it have been
involved in the flood of Noah?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It's possible that
the flood they'd hit Atlantis,

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.030 align:middle line:84%
or whatever inspired
the Atlantis story,

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:84%
the flood that inspired
the Noah story,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.380 align:middle line:84%
the flooded inspired the
Deucalion story in ancient

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Greece--

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.638 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's all
one and the same.

00:18:13.638 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: --the Epic of
Gilgamesh, famously the oldest

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.680 align:middle line:90%
known writing in the world.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:10%
It could all be
the same story, it

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:10%
could all be related stories.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:10%
There is a guy who I met,
an archaeologist out in New

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:10%
Mexico, who has looked at
all of the ancient myths

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:10%
and found these many
similarities between these,

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.710 align:middle line:10%
and he thinks it might've been a
comet that landed in the Indian

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.109 align:middle line:10%
Ocean around 2807 BC.

00:18:37.109 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ah, creating
a huge tsunami?

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Exactly, exactly.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And they went to
Madagascar and they

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.090 align:middle line:84%
look for these-- what
they call chevrons, which

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:84%
would've been essentially huge
splashes up the sides of hills

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:47.580 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's some pretty
compelling evidence

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.500 align:middle line:84%
that something could've
landed in the Indian Ocean

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.737 align:middle line:90%
around 2,800 BC.

00:18:53.737 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's a
message there for us, Mark,

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.774 align:middle line:84%
because if it happened
then, it could happen today.

00:18:58.774 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, remember, when
Plato's writing the Atlantis

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.990 align:middle line:84%
story, it's part of a
larger dialogue called

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:84%
the Timaeus, which is
his attempt to explain

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:90%
the nature of the universe.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.357 align:middle line:84%
And what he's saying is Greek
society is destroyed again

00:19:12.357 --> 00:19:13.190 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:84%
It's destroyed by comets,
and floods, and pestilence,

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and no matter how
high we get now,

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.239 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be taken down
again by some sort of disaster.

00:19:22.239 --> 00:19:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's no doubt.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:84%
No matter how big
you think you are,

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.758 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
knocked down at some point.

00:19:28.758 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, do you have any
doubts that Atlantis existed?

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Yes, I do have many
doubts that Atlantis existed.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do have doubts?

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I spent three
years thinking about this.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And Plato famously wrote in "The
Republic," probably the most

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
famous book in
Western civilization,

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.149 align:middle line:84%
there are stories
that are true, there

00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
are stories that
are false, and there

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.270 align:middle line:84%
are stories that are false,
but have truth in them.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
Atlantis story is

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.550 align:middle line:84%
a story that is true, but
has a lot of falsity in it.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I think Plato may
have taken stories

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:84%
that he heard from
Carthaginians sailors, that

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.110 align:middle line:84%
may have been passed down,
even through Solon via Egypt.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.235 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a perfectly
sensible scenario,

00:20:05.235 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that he might have
gotten information there.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And he may have put
all these together

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of
teaching his students

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:84%
at the first
university, the academy

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:90%
that he established in Athens.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.110 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember he
wasn't telling this story

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:90%
to excite people in 2016.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:10%
He was trying to teach a
bunch of guys sitting around

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:10%
in Athens around 360 BC.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.550 align:middle line:10%
So I think we would
have to find two

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.009 align:middle line:10%
things if we wanted to believe
that Atlantis had been real.

00:20:35.009 --> 00:20:37.425 align:middle line:10%
If you wanted to see it on the
front page of the "New York

00:20:37.425 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:10%
Times," you would either have
to find some sort of inscription

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:10%
in a temple in Egypt,
which is not impossible.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.186 align:middle line:84%
Although they've been
looking for a long time,

00:20:44.186 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
but they keep finding
new things there.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Or you would have to find a
combination of those three

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:90%
big clues.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.070 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to find the
concentric circles,

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:84%
it would have to be a
city that was wiped out

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:84%
by a watery disaster,
and it would

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.810 align:middle line:84%
have to be opposite
something that could qualify

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.136 align:middle line:90%
as the Pillars of Hercules.

00:20:58.136 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
we have historically

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:84%
found locations of
cities that have

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.967 align:middle line:84%
sunk because of some
catastrophes or some episode.

00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:84%
There is a city called Helike
in the southern part of Greece

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.570 align:middle line:84%
on the Peloponnesos that
nobody doubts actually

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:18.034 align:middle line:84%
sank during Plato's
lifetime, around 373 BC.

00:21:18.034 --> 00:21:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And there are archaeologists
there right now looking

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:90%
for evidence of Helike.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And if they find it, it's going
to be like King Tut times 10.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about a
golden age of Greece-- city

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
with all the temples
and all the statues

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
was just buried

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.850 align:middle line:84%
by a tsunami or some other
kind of flood overnight

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and is under the silt
there in southern Greece.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
If they find this
thing, it's going

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.551 align:middle line:90%
to be absolutely extraordinary.

00:21:40.551 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
at some of the searches

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:10%
for these sunken cities.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:10%
>>This is Cancho Roano,
one of the greatest

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:10%
archaeological discoveries
of the 20th century.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:10%
The 1970s and 1980s,
archaeologists

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:10%
discovered a series
of different villages

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:10%
that preserve Tartessan culture.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:10%
This Tartessan culture
was so different than all

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:10%
the other culture around it.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:10%
It was the culture of the South.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.530 align:middle line:10%
>>Freund believes Tartessan
culture was really Atlantean

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:10%
culture, but these
2,500-year-old ruins are 125

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:10%
miles from the coast--
a long way from home.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.780 align:middle line:10%
>>Why did they come here?

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:10%
Some cataclysmic
event on the coast

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:31.760 align:middle line:10%
pushed them out of their
homes in the ninth century.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:10%
>>Freund believes
this place is not

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:10%
the remains of a
once-bustling village.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:10%
Rather, it's a memorial to
the lost kingdom of Atlantis.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:10%


00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.360 align:middle line:10%
He calls it a ritual
city, and says

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.440 align:middle line:10%
this site is actually a
miniature replica of Atlantis

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.849 align:middle line:10%
built in homage.

00:22:54.849 --> 00:23:03.322 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.322 --> 00:23:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark,
isn't it fascinating

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.740 align:middle line:84%
how some of these theories
can just keep popping up?

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Oh, they pop
up again and again.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.807 align:middle line:84%
I was able to figure
out that more hypotheses

00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:84%
for the location of Atlantis
have come up in the last 10

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.695 align:middle line:84%
years than in the previous
2,400 years combined.

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that will
probably continue

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.611 align:middle line:90%
to grow over the next 10 years.

00:23:19.611 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What it also tells me
is what a violent planet we've

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.920 align:middle line:90%
had with these calamities.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:10%
I think it's two things.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.800 align:middle line:10%
One, people want to solve
what may be the greatest

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:10%
mystery of all time if
somebody found Atlantis,

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:10%
they would be famous overnight.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is that
idea that civilizations

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
come and civilizations go,
and when they're riding high,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.630 align:middle line:90%
they don't see the end coming.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:90%
But it is coming.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It comes for all
this in the end,

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and Atlantis is a
perfect example of that.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, though, you have
these doubts about whether this

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:90%
is real or not.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.960 align:middle line:84%
You also have those
thoughts that maybe it is.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:84%
At the end, I thought
there's a lot of evidence

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:84%
here that Plato
based this on what

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.000 align:middle line:90%
he believed to be real stories.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Whether we can go
back and find out

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:84%
what Plato believed to be
true, was actually true,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:90%
that's another question.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.930 align:middle line:84%
But it does seem to match
up with certain things

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.210 align:middle line:84%
in the archaeological
record, in written history

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
from that time that
indicates that he

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.990 align:middle line:84%
may have been basing this on
stories he believed to be true.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Emails in,
Jessie from Atlanta.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.815 align:middle line:84%
"How did you get
interested in Atlantis?"

00:24:32.815 --> 00:24:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: You know, when I was
writing my book about Machu

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.271 align:middle line:84%
Picchu, I was going
through microfilm,

00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and came across the front
page story in the newspaper.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Microfilm?

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:10%
What's microfilm?

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I know, 2/3 of
the audience is like, what?

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.580 align:middle line:10%
I came across a
front page newspaper

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.770 align:middle line:10%
story that says "German
Finds Atlantis in Africa"

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:10%
from 1911, around the time
Machu Picchu was found--

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:10%
the great era of exploration.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, people
are looking for Atlantis?

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought Atlantis was just
something for Saturday morning

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:01.370 align:middle line:90%
cartoons.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
But the more I got
into it, the more

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:84%
I realized that people
had seen that someone

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:84%
had been able to take and the
myth of Troy in "The Iliad"

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:90%
from Homer.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1870s, Heinrich
Schliemann, the German,

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.880 align:middle line:84%
had famously used the
clues from that myth

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.650 align:middle line:84%
to find the actual city of Troy,
and suddenly all bets were off.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And people are
like, well, maybe we

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.678 align:middle line:84%
can use the clues from
the Atlantis story

00:25:22.678 --> 00:25:23.549 align:middle line:90%
to find Atlantis.

00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
are there people

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:25.820 align:middle line:90%
out there looking for it?

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.194 align:middle line:84%
And the more I
looked, the more I

00:25:27.194 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:84%
realized there are a
lot of people looking

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.520 align:middle line:90%
for Atlantis pretty seriously.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They really are
desperately obsessed with this.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.744 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Absolutely, it
becomes an obsession.

00:25:34.744 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:90%
And I can relate to that.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I became pretty obsessed
with finding it.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will you feel
satisfied if they find Atlantis?

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.060 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Oh, no one
will be more delighted.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.515 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Not disappointed?

00:25:47.515 --> 00:25:50.830 align:middle line:10%
Because sometimes the
mystery of where it is

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:10%
is just as exciting as
the actual discovery.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I know, and it is
one of those things where

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I think life needs a
little bit of mystery.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It seems like every year we
have a little bit less mystery.

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, can you imagine

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:08.060 align:middle line:84%
if they found an inscription
in a temple in Egypt

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:90%
that matched Plato's story?

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.648 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would be amazing.

00:26:10.648 --> 00:26:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It would be like, oh
my god, this is incredible.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would also
tell you that stories

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:84%
of historical events that
are handed down to us,

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.529 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in the
Bible or Plato, are real.

00:26:23.529 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Yeah, and
that's one of the things

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:84%
the Plato was struggling with
when he wrote this story.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Written history was
less than 100 years old.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus had started what
we know as written history

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.110 align:middle line:90%
less than 100 years earlier.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So written history is
basically a new technology

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that Plato uses the
character of Socrates

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:90%
to argue about in his dialogues.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And he comes down
on the side of you

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:84%
know what, I have my doubts
about written history

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:84%
because you can't poke
it, you can't quit it.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.055 align:middle line:84%
I think oral history
in the form of myth,

00:26:50.055 --> 00:26:52.680 align:middle line:84%
whether it's true myth, or false
myth, or somewhere in between,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.332 align:middle line:84%
is superior to
written history, which

00:26:54.332 --> 00:26:56.540 align:middle line:84%
is a very different attitude
from what we have today.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.623 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another email in.

00:26:57.623 --> 00:26:59.310 align:middle line:90%
This from Carl in Malibu.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:84%

Cayce's Atlantis predictions

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:90%
found in the Bahamas-- Bimini?"

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I am extremely
skeptical about Edward Cayce's

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.270 align:middle line:90%
predictions about Bimini.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.978 align:middle line:84%
Everything I've seen
coming out of Bimini

00:27:13.978 --> 00:27:17.359 align:middle line:84%
has shown me almost
no correlation

00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:18.900 align:middle line:84%
with Plato's original
Atlantis story.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But something there.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: There's
something there,

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:84%
but it appears to be some
sort of natural formation

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:90%
under the water.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.374 align:middle line:84%
Which, in itself,
might be interesting.

00:27:25.374 --> 00:27:27.049 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not roads?

00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: The Bimini Road?

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.850 align:middle line:84%
No, that seems to be
a natural formation.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:33.310 align:middle line:10%
And Plato doesn't write
about roads anyway.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:10%
He gives dozens and
dozens of clues,

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:10%
but he mentions
nothing about a road.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we even speculate
on what the population might've

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:90%
been on Atlantis?

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: If Plato's
numbers were real,

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.050 align:middle line:84%
then it had to be
huge, because he

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.457 align:middle line:84%
talks about a naval force
of more than a million men.

00:27:49.457 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's where you
get into the area

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.020 align:middle line:84%
of whether he intended these
numbers to be taken literally.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I think the number
of the invasion

00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:01.500 align:middle line:84%
force it came into Normandy
on D-day was 156,000.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to get
more than a million guys

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.190 align:middle line:84%
to come from elsewhere in the
Mediterranean to attack Athens?

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.485 align:middle line:84%
It starts to beggar
belief a little bit.

00:28:12.485 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you to
paint a picture for us

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:90%
for a moment, Mark.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.010 align:middle line:90%


00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I want you to paint a picture
that all these people are

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:25.950 align:middle line:90%
on this island, thriving.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever this calamity
is hits them like that.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.636 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:28:31.636 --> 00:28:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I think
what's happening

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:84%
there is the same thing that
happens in Indonesian the day

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.820 align:middle line:90%
after Christmas of 2004.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Same thing we saw
happen in Fukushima.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.390 align:middle line:90%
Complete and utter panic.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:84%
You're being hit
by a wall of water.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you see it coming?

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:48.696 align:middle line:10%
Do you have time to prepare?

00:28:48.696 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Oh, I don't think
so, although it's interesting.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.050 align:middle line:10%
There are all these
stories from antiquity,

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:10%
and people still tell
these stories today.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But we talked about that city
in ancient Greece around 373

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:90%
that disappeared.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient
accounts, they say--

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and you hear this
again and again--

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:13.480 align:middle line:84%
all the animals ran for higher
ground before the tsunami came.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps there is
some truth to that.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:84%
There certainly seems to be
some folk wisdom behind it.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think if it happened,
the destruction of whatever

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.440 align:middle line:84%
the original city
of Atlantis was

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.660 align:middle line:84%
would have been immediate and a
complete and utter catastrophe.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the force
must've been so strong

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.590 align:middle line:90%
that it could sink this island.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, we actually
have a modern analog to this.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:84%
If what happened happened
just outside of Gibraltar,

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:46.040 align:middle line:84%
it was quite likely
the result of a shift

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:84%
in what's called the
Azores-Gibraltar Transform

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Fault, which causes a huge
earthquake roughly every 350

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:90%
to 400 years.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.010 align:middle line:84%
It destroyed the city
of Agadir in Morocco

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:84%
near where somebody thinks
Atlantis was located in 1960.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Obliterated the city.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:07.692 align:middle line:84%
And in 1755, it hit the capital
of Portugal-- it hit Lisbon,

00:30:07.692 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:90%
and we have accounts of this.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
absolute annihilation.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:84%
The city was
completely wiped out.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can still see
the few structures

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.937 align:middle line:84%
that were left in Lisbon
from the 1755 earthquake.

00:30:17.937 --> 00:30:19.395 align:middle line:84%
But if you read
the accounts today,

00:30:19.395 --> 00:30:20.950 align:middle line:90%
they're absolutely terrifying.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A marine
biologist an archaeologist

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.550 align:middle line:84%
discovered some things
around Alexandria in Egypt

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:90%
back in 2000.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a quick
look at that clip.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So what are we
looking at here, Mark?

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:34.110 align:middle line:90%
What are we seeing?

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: This is some
statuary and maybe

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:84%
some buildings from
what was believed

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:84%
to be the ancient city of
Alexandria, which was founded

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.620 align:middle line:84%
by Alexander the Great after he
conquered much the known world.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might this
have been the library?

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:50.453 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I don't think so.

00:30:50.453 --> 00:30:54.580 align:middle line:84%
That the story about the
library is that supposedly,

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.142 align:middle line:84%
on either one or two
occasions, its contents

00:30:57.142 --> 00:30:58.600 align:middle line:84%
were destroyed,
perhaps by burning.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.014 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.014 --> 00:31:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, for
those who don't know,

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.380 align:middle line:84%
the Library of Alexandria,
it was this repository

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:84%
of all the great knowledge of
the ancient world written down

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:14.740 align:middle line:84%
on scrolls that was
destroyed at a certain point,

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and maybe the answer
to the Atlantis story

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.110 align:middle line:84%
was held in that
library of Alexandria.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've found some great
things just off of Egypt there,

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and they're still pulling
things out at Heracleion,

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:25.590 align:middle line:90%
which is where this was taken.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.298 align:middle line:84%
Just amazing stuff
under the water there.

00:31:27.298 --> 00:31:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the fact that
these coastal cities have sunk

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.980 align:middle line:90%
tells me one of two things.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:84%
A calamity like a
tsunami pulls them down.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Or sea levels rose for some
reason and flooded them out.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Right.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're
looking at with cities

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.910 align:middle line:84%
along the Mediterranean coast
is more of a gradual sea level

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:50.720 align:middle line:90%
rise.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But as somebody pointed out
to me, when you build a city,

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.391 align:middle line:84%
you build it where a
river hits the sea.

00:31:56.391 --> 00:31:59.747 align:middle line:84%
If the sea rises 20 feet
over 5,000 years or whatever,

00:31:59.747 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:84%
you're going to lose
all those cities.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those
cities are yet

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:04.630 align:middle line:84%
to be discovered
under the water there.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:84%
They're probably under
silt and whatnot.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.610 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of talk that
Plato said Atlantis sank,

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:84%
it would agree
with roughly 9,600

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:19.430 align:middle line:84%
BC, which happens to be
around the time of the end

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:90%
of the last great ice age.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So people think, oh, well,
the glaciers started melting,

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and there was all this
water, and it sank the city.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:84%
But the glacial melt is
much like the glacial melt

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.800 align:middle line:84%
now that's occurring
with climate change.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.410 align:middle line:90%
It's very gradual.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So unless it was a breaching of
something like the Black Sea--

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's one theory, that
the Black Sea was breached,

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and that inspired
the story-- there's

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.610 align:middle line:84%
no real correlation with a
sudden destruction of an island

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:53.680 align:middle line:84%
city and the end of the
ice age around 9,600 BC.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Serena from Ohio
does want to ask you this.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:90%
"Did aliens build Atlantis?"

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: There is no
evidence that aliens

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.960 align:middle line:84%
were involved in the
construction of Atlantis.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, this you've
probably just touched.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Kramer from Arizona
talks about, "Did Plato

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.730 align:middle line:84%
say that Atlantis sank around
the time of the last ice age?"

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:20.510 align:middle line:84%
The end of the last
ice age is roughly,

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.680 align:middle line:90%
I think, 9700 BC it begins.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.460 align:middle line:84%
There is some evidence
in Plato that Atlantis

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.940 align:middle line:90%
sank around 9,600 BC.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:84%
So those two figures
seem to be very close,

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.120 align:middle line:84%
but that's if you're taking
Plato's numbers literally.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And as we talked about
earlier, if you're

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.960 align:middle line:84%
taking Plato's
numbers literally,

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:84%
then Atlantis had a navy of
1.2 million men in 9600 BC.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:47.076 align:middle line:84%
And that would be a significant
percentage of the population

00:33:47.076 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:84%
of the Mediterranean would
be in the Atlantean navy

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:90%
around that time.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.800 align:middle line:84%
So you have to start to look
more closely Plato's numbers

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and try to understand
what is he actually trying

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.030 align:middle line:90%
to do with these number here.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What this
tells me, Mark,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.770 align:middle line:84%
is that historically
this planet has

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:04.994 align:middle line:84%
gone through all
kinds of cataclysms.

00:34:04.994 --> 00:34:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Things have happened
here, whether there

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.710 align:middle line:84%
were asteroids that
struck, earthquakes that

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:13.110 align:middle line:90%
created tsunamis, volcanoes.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:18.889 align:middle line:84%
Extremely active planet done
over the thousands of years.

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Are we lucky today
that we haven't

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:25.650 align:middle line:84%
seen one of these things
happen, because we are so

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.940 align:middle line:84%
tied in the coastal
cities now, and areas.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these places
would all be wiped out.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:32.825 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Sure.

00:34:32.825 --> 00:34:36.460 align:middle line:84%
As a lot of people have pointed
out, of the city of Miami

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.090 align:middle line:90%
could be the next Atlantis.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The city of Miami is slowly
sinking as we speak here,

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and there are things like
super volcanoes, and comets,

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and asteroids that-- look
at the end of the dinosaurs

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.440 align:middle line:90%
65 million years ago.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bang.

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Bang.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.739 align:middle line:84%
The Tambora volcano
just 200 years ago

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:58.740 align:middle line:84%
was a year-- it wiped out the
summer for the entire planet,

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.540 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.970 align:middle line:84%
We missed an entire
year of growth.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.440 align:middle line:90%
These things do happen.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And as Plato-- I think this
was a big part of his message

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.532 align:middle line:84%
was saying, look, you don't
have control over as much

00:35:11.532 --> 00:35:12.990 align:middle line:84%
as you think you
have control over.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Civilizations get hit and
destroyed again and again

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.009 align:middle line:90%
Time is cyclical.

00:35:19.009 --> 00:35:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at Pompeii.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Look what happened to them.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.356 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: You look at Pompeii,
look at the people who

00:35:23.356 --> 00:35:24.660 align:middle line:90%
are in Santorini.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.582 align:middle line:84%
Again and again,
civilizations are destroyed.

00:35:27.582 --> 00:35:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do some of
them have the ability

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.450 align:middle line:84%
to get on little
boats and escape,

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:34.160 align:middle line:90%
or is it too late for that, too?

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I guess it would depend
on what kind of boats they had

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of
warning they had.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where
would they go?

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:41.755 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And where
would they go, sure.

00:35:41.755 --> 00:35:44.280 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if you're
being hit by a tsunami,

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.319 align:middle line:10%
do you suddenly get in
a boat and sail off?

00:35:46.319 --> 00:35:48.110 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, I've
never been in a tsunami.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And are you welcome to
this other location you show up

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.640 align:middle line:10%
at?

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: There's no
evidence whatsoever

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.100 align:middle line:84%
from Plato's original story
that anybody from Atlantis

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:90%
went anywhere.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.290 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.415 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think we'll
ever get these answers?

00:36:00.415 --> 00:36:02.130 align:middle line:90%


00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I'm pretty dubious.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:08.922 align:middle line:84%
And one reason why is if you
look at the Mediterranean

00:36:08.922 --> 00:36:10.380 align:middle line:84%
from an archaeological
perspective,

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.830 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of heartbreaking,
because you realize that

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:14.970 align:middle line:84%
whatever the original
inspiration for the Atlantis

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:20.740 align:middle line:84%
story was is likely under some
luxury 36-hole golf course now.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:25.120 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of things
have been ripped off

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.660 align:middle line:10%
the bottom of the
Mediterranean Sea floor,

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:31.230 align:middle line:10%
or bulldozed over to make a
condo complex or something.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So we'll never know
what we don't know.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does
humankind want to imagine

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.890 align:middle line:90%
that Atlantis was huge?

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.667 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Because it
was a golden age.

00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has nostalgia
deep in their heart.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:84%
They like to look
back to a golden age.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Things were better before
we had the internet,

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
or things were better when
we all ate paleo diets,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and things were always
better way back when.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And Atlantis is
like a blank screen

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.527 align:middle line:84%
onto which we can project
whatever we want it to be.

00:37:01.527 --> 00:37:03.943 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there are so
many different interpretations

00:37:03.943 --> 00:37:05.220 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:84%
If you want it to be a
technologically sophisticated

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.090 align:middle line:84%
civilization, that's
what you think.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:15.170 align:middle line:84%
If you want to think that
aliens came from the planet Xenu

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and created Atlantis, that's
when you're going to thank.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it's just so
much more interesting

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:25.720 align:middle line:84%
to look at the clues in the
original story that Plato gave,

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.600 align:middle line:84%
which is, like I said, it's
essentially a treasure map.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you look hard
enough, you can see

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.970 align:middle line:90%
where the X might have been.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's much more
interesting than speculation.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When might
it have happened?

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, there's
a lot of theories.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:44.660 align:middle line:10%
I think what makes the most
sense is that whatever happened

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.630 align:middle line:10%
to inspire the story of Atlantis
was probably something related

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:10%
to what we call the end of the
Late Bronze Age, which happened

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:58.920 align:middle line:10%
in the late 12th century
BC and prior to that.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Somehow there was a series
of earthquakes, famines, mass

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:07.500 align:middle line:84%
migrations in the
Mediterranean area.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And we have sources
for this from

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.180 align:middle line:84%
various ancient
civilizations-- myths

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.000 align:middle line:90%
that have been passed down.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think it makes
sense that whatever

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.530 align:middle line:84%
inspired the story probably
happened in that span

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.340 align:middle line:90%
around 1200 BC.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, there is
one eminent Atlantologist

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.110 align:middle line:84%
who works at a
university in Greece who

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:33.600 align:middle line:84%
has shown that if you
take that figure of 9600

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:39.430 align:middle line:84%
BC, but using lunar years as
were used in Egypt sometimes

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and redo the math, it
comes out to 1200 BC.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.660 align:middle line:10%
So perhaps if you were using
a lunar calendar rather than

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.415 align:middle line:10%
a solar calendar, the
number works out that way.

00:38:48.415 --> 00:38:50.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Part of the
myth is that it happened

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.600 align:middle line:10%
30,000 years ago, that they
want to Central America,

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.500 align:middle line:10%
they went to Egypt,
and they fled and went

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.470 align:middle line:10%
to different regions.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, that can all be
traced back to a single source

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:04.370 align:middle line:84%
as well, which is
Ignatius Donnelly in 1882.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:08.260 align:middle line:84%
He's this flamboyant
Minnesota congressman

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:13.490 align:middle line:84%
who sits down at his desk at
his failed housing project

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:16.430 align:middle line:84%
that he's put together
far from Minneapolis,

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and he's trying to
rebuild his life.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And what he says
is, OK, they just

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:21.890 align:middle line:84%
found Troy using
ancient knowledge.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pull together every
single scrap of ancient history

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and try to prove that Atlantis
was the beginning of all

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.180 align:middle line:90%
these ancient civilizations.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back and
look at it, some of it

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.860 align:middle line:84%
makes some sense, and
some of it is just crazy.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.884 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, that has
been passed down from generation

00:39:39.884 --> 00:39:41.300 align:middle line:84%
to generation, and
a lot of people

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.610 align:middle line:90%
take that as the original story.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did Atlantis
have enemies during that time?

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Why did
Atlantis have enemies?

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.050 align:middle line:10%
Well, why does any
civilization have enemies?

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They wanted something.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:55.680 align:middle line:90%
People wanted something.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, I think in
the story that Plato tells,

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis is invading
Athens, and Athens

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.357 align:middle line:84%
rescues the rest of
the Mediterranean,

00:40:05.357 --> 00:40:06.815 align:middle line:84%
protects the rest
of Mediterranean.

00:40:06.815 --> 00:40:09.700 align:middle line:90%


00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.980 align:middle line:84%
If you want to translate
it into Star Wars terms,

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Athens is the evil
empire, and-- I'm sorry,

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis is the evil empire,
and Athens are the rebels,

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and they're there
to rescue everyone

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:25.420 align:middle line:84%
from the invading
powers of Atlantis.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:30.335 align:middle line:10%
A lot of that is interpretation,
so until we have more evidence,

00:40:30.335 --> 00:40:31.210 align:middle line:10%
we can't really know.

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:33.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If that's
true, could everything

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:10%
that happened to Atlantis
have been God's will?

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Now you're
getting into an area that's

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:43.369 align:middle line:90%
far above my pay grade, George.

00:40:43.369 --> 00:40:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And also
there's speculation

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.640 align:middle line:90%
that they were nuked.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.850 align:middle line:90%
That's another possibility.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:50.860 align:middle line:84%
With some kind of
high technology.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I would say the
chances that Atlantis

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:58.150 align:middle line:84%
was nuked are very,
very, very slim.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might they have been
hit directly by an asteroid?

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I would say there's a
chance that whatever the island

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.160 align:middle line:84%
civilization was that inspired
the Atlantis story was

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.900 align:middle line:84%
destroyed by a comet or asteroid
or something that hit the ocean

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.670 align:middle line:84%
and caused a flood
somewhere, I think

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:14.860 align:middle line:90%
that's absolutely possible.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:21.524 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So in your opinion,
was Atlantis real or not?

00:41:21.524 --> 00:41:22.815 align:middle line:90%
I know you said you had doubts.

00:41:22.815 --> 00:41:25.680 align:middle line:90%


00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you had to put
it all on the line?

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.410 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: If I had to
put it all on the line,

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:32.620 align:middle line:10%
I would put it in a book--

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.745 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Called "Meet
Me in Atlantis."

00:41:35.745 --> 00:41:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: --and sell that book
so I could pay my mortgage.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.350 align:middle line:90%
That's as close as I'll say.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Books don't make
big mortgage payments.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.500 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Well, it depends.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
story of Atlantis

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:56.080 align:middle line:84%
was probably based, at least
in part, on real events.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On real events?

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yeah.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
happened somewhere.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I think the
story of Atlantis,

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:03.820 align:middle line:84%
especially the numbers
in the story of Atlantis,

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.810 align:middle line:90%
deserves a lot closer study.

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't getting
that study now

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.940 align:middle line:84%
because most academics consider
it to be a fringe subject.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I think if people took a
closer look at the numbers

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:19.680 align:middle line:84%
in Plato's story, and people
did a lot more interpretation

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.960 align:middle line:84%
of the original myth,
we might find ourselves

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.506 align:middle line:90%
closer to an original truth.

00:42:24.506 --> 00:42:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And with
all these discoveries

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:29.250 align:middle line:84%
of some of these ancient
cities that have sunk,

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:32.716 align:middle line:84%
is it conceivable we've
already found Atlantis?

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: It is conceivable.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.810 align:middle line:90%
It's conceivable.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I would say the thing
that has been found

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:44.590 align:middle line:84%
or might have been found that
most closely parallels Atlantis

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:49.010 align:middle line:84%
would be the culture of
Tartessos in southern Spain.

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are reputable
sources-- Aristotle,

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.575 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus-- who
mention Tartessos.

00:42:55.575 --> 00:42:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So historians, archaeologists,
anthropologists,

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.070 align:middle line:84%
they generally believe that
there was a Tartessian culture,

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and they have found artifacts
and things like that.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:09.740 align:middle line:84%
What they have not found
is a rock-solid location

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.150 align:middle line:84%
for that original
city of Tartessos.

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:14.900 align:middle line:84%
If they found that,
then you could

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.021 align:middle line:84%
do a more serious comparison
between Tartessos and the clues

00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:84%
that Plato gives in the
original Atlantis story,

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.145 align:middle line:90%
and you might have a match.

00:43:21.145 --> 00:43:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there many
archaeologists desperately

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.290 align:middle line:90%
trying to find Atlantis?

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: No, there are
very few archaeologists

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:29.650 align:middle line:84%
looking for Atlantis right
now, because it's not

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:31.420 align:middle line:90%
taken seriously as a subject.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're someone who says, I'm
going out to look for Atlantis,

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.340 align:middle line:84%
as an archaeologist, you'll get
kicked out of the department.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.040 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Because it's
considered a fringe subject.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.498 align:middle line:10%
Because so many
people have come up

00:43:41.498 --> 00:43:43.534 align:middle line:10%
with crazy theories
over the years, and in--

00:43:43.534 --> 00:43:45.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's one of the most
exciting subjects out there.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.010 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I know, and
it comes from Plato,

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.960 align:middle line:10%
who is one of the great thinkers
of Western civilization,

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.690 align:middle line:10%
and he gives all this detail.

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:56.280 align:middle line:10%
And as somebody told
me, Plato is probably

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.980 align:middle line:10%
the most difficult philosopher
in Western civilization.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And the numbers in his dialogues
are the most difficult part

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:07.270 align:middle line:90%
of Plato's work.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.714 align:middle line:84%
But no one has really
dug into these numbers

00:44:09.714 --> 00:44:10.630 align:middle line:90%
in Atlantis seriously.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:12.630 align:middle line:90%
A few people have, but not much.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think there might be so
much more there to be found.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And once these numbers are
looked at a lot more closely,

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:21.970 align:middle line:84%
we may have a completely
different perspective

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:23.730 align:middle line:84%
on Atlantis 10, 20,
30 years from now.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, thanks
for being on the program.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate it.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: George,
it's such a pleasure.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.535 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:44:27.535 --> 00:44:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have been
obsessed, like you have,

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.500 align:middle line:84%
with finding Atlantis
since I was a little boy.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I never went out
searching, but thank

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.650 align:middle line:84%
God we have books like
"Meet Me in Atlantis,"

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:42.260 align:middle line:84%
because it's like a
roadmap to discovery.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.216 align:middle line:90%
This is "Beyond Belief."
