[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.902 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to another edition

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:27.694 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:28.278 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:31.323 align:middle line:10%
And wait till you hear
this incredible story

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:32.406 align:middle line:10%
from Jason Rice.

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:35.369 align:middle line:84%
Now Jason is an engineer,
former second lieutenant

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.996 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
Army, a military person,

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.539 align:middle line:90%
just like I was.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.501 align:middle line:84%
And he will be telling us a
story about the Secret Space

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:43.627 align:middle line:90%
Program--

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:47.339 align:middle line:84%
not just that it exists, but
what his involvement in it

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:48.632 align:middle line:90%
has been.

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:50.592 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
knock your socks off.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.177 align:middle line:84%
Jason, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:52.719 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON RICE: Thank you, George.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.512 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:55.222 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What an amazing story.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely amazing.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.978 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the first
glimpse of it, somebody

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:05.524 align:middle line:84%
who will hear this story is
going to say, oh, come on.

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:07.484 align:middle line:90%
Secret Space Program?

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.361 align:middle line:90%
This happened to him?

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.947 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to somebody
like that at this point?

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:13.657 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: At this
point, I would say,

00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:16.243 align:middle line:10%
if I was talking to
myself two years ago,

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.036 align:middle line:10%
that I would have had
the same thoughts.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:18.787 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:19.371 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: I would have.

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:20.122 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You would
have doubted yourself?

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:21.748 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: I would have doubted it.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:25.002 align:middle line:84%
But having had the memories that
have come back to me, the ones

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.337 align:middle line:84%
that I've been able
to regain and relive,

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:30.882 align:middle line:84%
I know for certain that
the Secret Space Program

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:35.554 align:middle line:84%
is for real, that there is a
shadow government, that there

00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:39.015 align:middle line:84%
are things and technologies
that are available that

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:42.561 align:middle line:84%
aren't available to the rest of
the population on this planet.

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:46.356 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back to the
beginning that you can recall.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.191 align:middle line:84%
And then tell us about
this recollection,

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.735 align:middle line:90%
how this is coming back to you.

00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I also
understand that you

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.491 align:middle line:84%
have agreed to do some past
life regression and also

00:01:56.491 --> 00:02:00.746 align:middle line:84%
some other types of studies
to pull this out of you.

00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:02.247 align:middle line:90%
You're not hiding anything.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.749 align:middle line:84%
But how did this
first start coming?

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.002 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did you have dreams,
nightmares about a Secret Space

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:07.794 align:middle line:90%
Program?

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.794 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:11.089 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, the
very first indication

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:12.591 align:middle line:84%
that something
wasn't right, George,

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:16.261 align:middle line:90%
was when I exited the US Army.

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:19.431 align:middle line:84%
I had PTSD that I
was suffering from.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.183 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first indication

00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:22.934 align:middle line:90%
that there was something wrong.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And not having a
context to put it to,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.108 align:middle line:84%
it was just one of
those strange things.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:31.735 align:middle line:84%
And so a number
of years went by,

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:33.904 align:middle line:84%
and I went in for
outpatient surgery.

00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:37.115 align:middle line:84%
This was the second indication
that something was off.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:41.119 align:middle line:84%
I was coming out
of the anesthesia.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.038 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
this, but I was told this

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:90%
by the surgical staff.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.959 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking about my
involvement in a space program,

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.795 align:middle line:84%
being an astronaut
and being out in space

00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:52.214 align:middle line:84%
and helping with
the space program.

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:54.925 align:middle line:84%
And they chalked it up to
talking under the medication.

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:55.716 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:55.716 --> 00:02:58.053 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And I again
had no context for it.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like, OK, that
was just one of those things.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.973 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember it anyway.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:06.353 align:middle line:84%
A number of years go by, and I
start having things come back.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.814 align:middle line:84%
OK, I think I remember
doing this before,

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:12.067 align:middle line:84%
but I have no waking
memory of this.

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.069 align:middle line:90%
It felt like I'd done it before.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
An example would have
been I had participated

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.994 align:middle line:84%
in a hang gliding class in
which you go into a Groupon

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.663 align:middle line:84%
and you go with a
bunch of other people.

00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:25.704 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So the first
time I tried it,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.293 align:middle line:84%
I was airborne and made
it all the way down

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:33.964 align:middle line:84%
to the end of the
field, all 850 feet,

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:36.216 align:middle line:90%
with 10 minutes of instruction.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.552 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people may chalk
that up to, OK, you're

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.929 align:middle line:84%
pretty good with your
kinesthetics and your ability

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:41.721 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:42.514 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Naturally.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.558 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Naturally, just
jump on a hang glider.

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:45.684 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:47.561 align:middle line:84%
I knew as soon as
I got airborne,

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.353 align:middle line:90%
I've done this before.

00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:52.524 align:middle line:84%
And that, again, was
an out of place memory

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:55.485 align:middle line:84%
that, OK, I don't recall
ever doing this before

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.487 align:middle line:90%
and have no record of it.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Years go by.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.741 align:middle line:84%
Again, I go through
scuba training.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.035 align:middle line:84%
And the type of scuba
mask that I bought

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:06.413 align:middle line:90%
happened to be a full face mask.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:11.042 align:middle line:84%
And so I had that type of
scuba mask because the work

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.753 align:middle line:84%
I was doing at the time required
that I needed to communicate

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:14.963 align:middle line:90%
with the surface.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:15.755 align:middle line:90%
So it--

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.048 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they're big masks.

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.048 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It's a big mask.

00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:18.884 align:middle line:90%
It's a full face.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:22.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not a regulator in your
mouth where you can't talk.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.139 align:middle line:84%
And that was another
memory flashback.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.682 align:middle line:90%
I've done this before.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:84%
But I've never had any
certifications for scuba, much

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.561 align:middle line:90%
less a full face mask for it.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.646 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you are having
these deja vu experiences.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:32.355 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I was.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.982 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
were getting stronger

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.233 align:middle line:90%
and stronger and stronger.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.026 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They were.

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:36.818 align:middle line:90%
They were.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, in 2016, they really
started coming back strongly.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.492 align:middle line:84%
That's when the dream
started kicking in.

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:47.621 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that that
was the 20-year anniversary,

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:51.332 align:middle line:84%
or just before the 20-year
anniversary, of my getting out.

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:56.213 align:middle line:84%
2016 was 20 years from when my
in-processing actually started.

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:58.757 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you were in and
out a couple times, weren't you?

00:04:58.757 --> 00:04:59.716 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:00.509 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:01.968 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the
story that we're

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:06.264 align:middle line:84%
going to unfold today here with
Jason is absolutely remarkable.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.017 align:middle line:84%
You started this
and the recruitment

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.894 align:middle line:90%
started at what age?

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I was around age two.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.439 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Two years old?

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.732 align:middle line:90%
Are your parents still alive?

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:16.983 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They are.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
recollect any of this?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.486 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:84%
They recollect my going to a
special behavioral program.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.326 align:middle line:84%
But to them, it was because
I was an escape artist

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.786 align:middle line:84%
and kept getting
out of the house.

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:31.498 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what
point would they

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.707 align:middle line:84%
have gotten to you
at two years old

00:05:33.707 --> 00:05:35.627 align:middle line:84%
and your parents
not know about it?

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:37.128 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: While I was
at these classes

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.713 align:middle line:90%
at this behavioral modification.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:39.506 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.799 align:middle line:90%
As a two-year-old.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:43.009 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: As a 2 and 1/2,
three-year-old, yes.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.971 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're in
these classes and somebody

00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.808 align:middle line:84%
from the Secret Space Program,
some government agency,

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.101 align:middle line:90%
they get to you?

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.936 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The MILAB
program was heavily

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:56.064 align:middle line:84%
involved in recruiting
and finding new recruits.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.857 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways
that I'm convinced they

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.777 align:middle line:84%
did this was through
setting up agreements

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:04.197 align:middle line:84%
with these behavioral
modification programs.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Because most of the kids
that are intuitive empaths

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.162 align:middle line:84%
are highly energetic,
don't listen, won't obey,

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.248 align:middle line:84%
have their own
mind about things.

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:17.335 align:middle line:84%
And so they will clandestinely
make arrangements

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:20.255 align:middle line:84%
with these groups and these
organizations that are

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.173 align:middle line:90%
doing psychological research.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.342 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure some of it was.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.428 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they would never
be allowed to get away

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:27.637 align:middle line:90%
with what they did then.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they put us in a box.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.389 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.016 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're two years
old at the time.

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.017 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:34.436 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are you doing
with a little two-year-old kid

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:35.812 align:middle line:90%
for some agency?

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:38.023 align:middle line:90%
What are they training you for?

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:40.233 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They're getting
to know who you are,

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.027 align:middle line:84%
getting to know what
you can and can't do.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:43.403 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're
watching you.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.654 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They're watching.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:49.034 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until years later,
at the age of six or seven,

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.994 align:middle line:84%
that they actually started
getting me involved,

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.954 align:middle line:84%
taking me on field trips
while I was at school.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:53.747 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A-ha.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.334 align:middle line:84%
So along the way,
they're watching you.

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:90%
They're training you.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.212 align:middle line:84%
They're mind washing
you, basically.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.173 align:middle line:84%
And then, once you get
to that certain age,

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:04.299 align:middle line:90%
it's time to start--

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:04.633 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Training

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:06.051 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --using
and training you.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:06.718 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:07.594 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You talked about MILAB.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:08.803 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.555 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Military
Abduction Program.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:14.309 align:middle line:84%
Training of the kids in
combat tactics, the ability

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.896 align:middle line:84%
to use their intuitive
empath abilities,

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:84%
how to manipulate people, how
to use their intuitive empath

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.737 align:middle line:84%
skills to read situations
or to figure things out

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.947 align:middle line:84%
that they've never
seen or done before.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.324 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
students do you

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.159 align:middle line:84%
think were involved
or are involved

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.118 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of program?

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.161 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: There's no telling.

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:33.953 align:middle line:90%
I know that they have--

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Countless numbers?

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.414 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Countless thousand.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.207 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thousands.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.041 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Globally.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.709 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
ever pay you for this?

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.878 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever recollect
an individual you were assigned

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.509 align:middle line:90%
to or anything like that?

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:48.468 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.844 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
is all starting

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.096 align:middle line:90%
to come back to you now.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:51.846 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.515 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
an amazing program.

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:56.267 align:middle line:84%
There's a fellow by the name of
Randy Cramer, a whistleblower.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:57.519 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you know him.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.605 align:middle line:84%
He claims that he went through
a secret space program,

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:01.940 align:middle line:90%
as a number of people have.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.441 align:middle line:84%
Corey Goode is
another one who has

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.444 align:middle line:84%
mentioned that he's gone
through a secret space program.

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:08.655 align:middle line:84%
Your situation could be
different from Corey's.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.532 align:middle line:90%
But let's look in on Randy.

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:11.616 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:13.076 align:middle line:10%
>>RANDY CRAMER:
Project Moon Shadow

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:15.829 align:middle line:10%
was the project which
genetically engineered

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:20.542 align:middle line:10%
and trained me and
299 other young boys

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:24.129 align:middle line:10%
and girls, for a total of
300 of us, in the project.

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle line:84%
We were all genetically
engineered from the ground up,

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Petri dish level, and then
trained from pretty much--

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.889 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the
programming, the sort

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
of teaching training programming
starts at a infantile toddler

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.352 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
physical, like showing up

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.233 align:middle line:84%
to physical locations for
training, probably by 4,

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.776 align:middle line:90%
4 and 1/2 years old.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So very, very, very
young starting.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.741 align:middle line:84%
But none of those early stage
training programs and so forth

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.493 align:middle line:84%
are like really shocking or
violent or scary or anything.

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:59.622 align:middle line:84%
They're all just programs
and training systems

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.751 align:middle line:84%
designed to teach you
hand-eye coordination, group

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:04.711 align:middle line:84%
dynamic functions,
how to work as a team.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.299 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, does
that sound familiar?

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.675 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It does.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:13.136 align:middle line:84%
It does, with group
dynamics, working as a team,

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:14.637 align:middle line:84%
learning to work
together, learning

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.973 align:middle line:84%
to identify and recognize
other people's strengths

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:17.766 align:middle line:90%
and weaknesses.

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.684 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might you have
been in that program,

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.187 align:middle line:84%
or do you think there
are a number of others?

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.481 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I have a strong
feeling that there

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:28.234 align:middle line:84%
are a number of protocol
programs that they utilize.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:31.321 align:middle line:84%
And depending on your strengths
and your individual weaknesses,

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.406 align:middle line:84%
you will go to a
specific program.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.033 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they get to the point

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:38.036 align:middle line:84%
where you don't
have memory of this?

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.205 align:middle line:90%
What do they do to you?

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Throughout
the program, because

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.042 align:middle line:84%
of the technology
and the medication

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.752 align:middle line:84%
and pharmaceuticals
that they have,

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:84%
they are able to memory wipe
you from the experience.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.717 align:middle line:84%
And then, when
you're brought back

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.427 align:middle line:84%
to go through
additional training,

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.597 align:middle line:84%
they're able to selectively
turn on and off those memories

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.349 align:middle line:90%
as needed to suit their needs.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.893 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which I think may be
what happened to Sirhan Sirhan,

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.645 align:middle line:90%
the assassin of Robert Kennedy--

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:04.437 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.147 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --who
continues to this day

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.358 align:middle line:84%
to claim that he
has blanked out,

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that he has no recollection
of what he did even though he

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.655 align:middle line:90%
was clearly there.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.406 align:middle line:90%
They grabbed a gun from him.

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:17.951 align:middle line:84%
But he has no idea
that he was there.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.411 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: You look throughout
history at the number of people

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:24.249 align:middle line:84%
that have had that exact kind
of thing happen, and it's--

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:29.087 align:middle line:84%
to me, you can't have that
kind of smoke without a fire.

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:30.964 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Case in point,
Jason, while we're

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.341 align:middle line:84%
talking about Sirhan
Sirhan, of course,

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.009 align:middle line:84%
is his attorney,
whom I know well,

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:37.095 align:middle line:84%
William Pepper,
talking about the fact

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
that Sirhan Sirhan has no
recollection of what happened.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.601 align:middle line:10%
>>ADRIAN FINIGHAN: You
touched upon it there,

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:46.312 align:middle line:10%
events in that kitchen.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.273 align:middle line:10%
You can see then that
your client was there

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.024 align:middle line:10%
and that he fired his gun.

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:52.735 align:middle line:10%
Take us through the
scenario that you

00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:55.238 align:middle line:10%
believe developed there.

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:10%
Why was he there, your
client, with a gun?

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.785 align:middle line:10%
And why did he fire it?

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:07.959 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM PEPPER: Sirhan was
hypno-programmed in months

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:10.128 align:middle line:10%
prior to the assassination.

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:16.467 align:middle line:10%
He does not remember at all why
he was there and what he did

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.303 align:middle line:10%
and what happened there.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.138 align:middle line:10%
There's an indication
of that, of course,

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.140 align:middle line:10%
and it's been commented
on by a number of people

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:10%
who have seen photographs
of him after the arrest.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.231 align:middle line:10%
I've spent nearly three hours
with him not so long ago.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's quite clear that
he still does not recall.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.697 align:middle line:10%
Now, he was told
that he did this.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.658 align:middle line:10%
He was told that he was guilty.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.660 align:middle line:10%
And so he said,
they told me this.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.828 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember it.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.121 align:middle line:10%
I was there.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.247 align:middle line:10%
I had a gun.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.583 align:middle line:10%
I actually discharged
the weapon.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.502 align:middle line:10%
He fired eight shots
of that weapon,

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:53.671 align:middle line:10%
although six were
fired when his hand was

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:55.465 align:middle line:10%
pinned to the steam table.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:59.844 align:middle line:10%
So he said, at the time, I guess
I just assumed that I did it.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.054 align:middle line:10%
And everyone told me that.

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:03.806 align:middle line:10%
And his own lawyer at the time,
of course his trial counsel,

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:06.184 align:middle line:10%
was a fellow called
Grant Cooper.

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:10.647 align:middle line:10%
Now, Cooper was subject to an
indictment during the time when

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.649 align:middle line:10%
he was Sirhan's--

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:16.653 align:middle line:10%
a federal indictment when
he was Sirhan's counsel.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:18.529 align:middle line:10%
So they didn't even
put up a defense.

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, do you feel
violated because of this?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.075 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Absolutely.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:26.829 align:middle line:84%
When I first started really
waking up in 2016, I was angry.

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:29.123 align:middle line:84%
You know you go through the
multiple steps of grieving?

00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:30.833 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Anger is one of them.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.214 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
done to hurt you?

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:37.465 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what was their intent?

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:38.591 align:middle line:90%
Why take you?

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Why not just take some
volunteer who wants to do this?

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.847 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to get
into the Secret Space Program

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:46.808 align:middle line:90%
and what you think it is.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:51.479 align:middle line:84%
But why grab somebody
and change his life

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.816 align:middle line:84%
like they did to you instead of
getting somebody to volunteer?

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.567 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've been
in the military.

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.111 align:middle line:90%
I've been in the military.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.113 align:middle line:84%
We probably would have
volunteered for a program

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:00.905 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:01.155 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:03.074 align:middle line:84%
With full disclosure,
you'll have

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
a much fewer number of
people actually volunteering.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.829 align:middle line:84%
But you'll still
have volunteers.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.039 align:middle line:84%
They did it because
they believed they were

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.249 align:middle line:90%
doing the right thing for--

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must
have done things

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.213 align:middle line:84%
to you that were very
dangerous and serious that they

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.673 align:middle line:90%
didn't want you to know about.

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:19.924 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, they did.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:23.219 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want to
have that type of tool

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:27.557 align:middle line:84%
at free will use running
amongst the population.

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:30.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about the
Secret Space Program per se.

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.729 align:middle line:90%
What is it, in your opinion?

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:34.188 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The Secret
Space Program is

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:35.815 align:middle line:90%
a number of different programs.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:36.941 align:middle line:90%
There isn't one.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:37.942 align:middle line:90%
There's a bunch of them.

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.277 align:middle line:90%
The Air Force has their own.

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:90%
The Navy has their own.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.613 align:middle line:84%
There's a breakaway
civilization,

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:45.616 align:middle line:84%
the Antarctic German
breakaway civilization.

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:46.868 align:middle line:90%
They have their own.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.578 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of
different governments

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:52.206 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that has their
own secret space programs.

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:56.461 align:middle line:84%
It's the use of
advanced technology

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:59.589 align:middle line:84%
for whatever their
agendas may be.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:03.926 align:middle line:84%
It may be for dominance over
their particular air space.

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:05.470 align:middle line:90%
It may be for science.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:10.433 align:middle line:84%
It may be for control of
their individual populations,

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:13.561 align:middle line:84%
in that they are able to develop
additional technologies to do

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:14.353 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:18.441 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think you
have been an astronaut?

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:21.277 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Not in any
conventional sense, but yes.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.613 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
traveled to the moon?

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.031 align:middle line:90%
Have you traveled to the Mars?

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.532 align:middle line:90%
Where have they taken you?

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.201 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I've trained on Earth.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:31.162 align:middle line:84%
I've trained on the lunar
operations command on the moon.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.997 align:middle line:90%
I've been on Mars.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been on multiple
other planets.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.503 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
to Mars, for example?

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:39.295 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: By shuttle.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.088 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: By shuttle.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.256 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many years ago?

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:47.637 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: This was
originally in 1997.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
long were you there?

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.431 align:middle line:84%
Do you have
recollection of that?

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:51.849 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The
recollections I have--

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:54.519 align:middle line:84%
the first training base
that I was at, George--

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:59.398 align:middle line:84%
and giving this more thought
as the memories come back,

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.193 align:middle line:90%
we progressed to the base.

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:06.864 align:middle line:84%
We progressed to the base by
the tunnel system underground.

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:09.617 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up
in a large cavern.

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:12.829 align:middle line:84%
And the cavern could
have been anywhere.

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:13.704 align:middle line:90%
They told us it was--

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:14.789 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
believe it's Mars.

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.374 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They told
us it was Georgia.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:17.041 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Georgia?

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:18.543 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They told
us it was Georgia.

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:21.587 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very convinced that
was disinformation on purpose.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.631 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you were on Mars?

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:24.715 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I had a feeling--

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:25.383 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
telling you it's Georgia

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:26.717 align:middle line:90%
but you're on another planet?

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:28.886 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I have a feeling
it was off planet.

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:30.388 align:middle line:84%
They told us in the
briefings that we

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:34.976 align:middle line:84%
would spend eight months in our
first training in that cave,

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:38.396 align:middle line:84%
and then the next six months
would be spent on the moon.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:41.107 align:middle line:84%
And then the last four months
would be spent on Mars.

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:44.443 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you were
around the age of 10 to 13,

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:46.237 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in your life?

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:49.615 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: 10 to 13
in my life, I was

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:51.951 align:middle line:84%
going through a lot
of issues at home.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:56.747 align:middle line:84%
They look for families that
have hard times because it's

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:59.792 align:middle line:84%
much easier to manipulate what's
going on, where the kids are

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.752 align:middle line:84%
and what's going
on as far as how

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:03.754 align:middle line:90%
they can keep things hidden.

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:06.465 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are they doing to
you at this age training wise?

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.633 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Training wise?

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.969 align:middle line:84%
They're taking me out
during school hours,

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.806 align:middle line:84%
taking me to bases or to a
local facility in which they're

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:16.559 align:middle line:90%
doing additional training.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.186 align:middle line:84%
It could be anything
from team building

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:21.105 align:middle line:84%
to small individual
combat tactics.

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:23.232 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your
friends at the time--

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:26.235 align:middle line:84%
do you remember your friends
saying, Jason, where are you

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:27.236 align:middle line:90%
all the time?

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Why are you leaving us?

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.573 align:middle line:90%
Anything like that?

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:31.949 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.577 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what times
would they take you?

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.704 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They would take
during the school day,

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:38.748 align:middle line:84%
but they would also take
me during the night.

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.625 align:middle line:84%
Because I do remember
occasions in which

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.877 align:middle line:90%
I was at an abandoned mall.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:46.923 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your parents know
who they were at any point?

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:49.717 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: If they did, they were
wiped of that information.

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:51.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The program
was called First 20.

00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: 20 and back.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.472 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that.

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.265 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The 20 and
Back program is

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:59.518 align:middle line:84%
essentially, let's give
you the opportunity

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:01.229 align:middle line:90%
to serve your country.

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.147 align:middle line:84%
Let's give you a chance
to go out in space

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:05.483 align:middle line:90%
and do some incredible things.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.484 align:middle line:84%
At the end of that
20-year period,

00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:09.362 align:middle line:84%
because you've been
away from Earth,

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:12.490 align:middle line:84%
we're going to give you a chance
to go back right to the time

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.242 align:middle line:90%
and point in which you left.

00:17:15.242 --> 00:17:19.038 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be able to
continue on with your life.

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the 20 and Back program.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.707 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's kind
of intriguing.

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:23.125 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It's very intriguing.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And the dangling of
that particular fruit

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:84%
in front of you,
especially during an era

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.508 align:middle line:84%
when Star Wars has
just come out--

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.344 align:middle line:84%
all the science fiction
has been maturing

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:35.179 align:middle line:90%
for the last 30 or 40 years.

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.973 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
information out there

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:41.018 align:middle line:90%
about what the potential is.

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:44.188 align:middle line:84%
And so being able to participate
in something like that

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:46.482 align:middle line:90%
is an incredible motivator.

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.317 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So these
recollections are

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:50.945 align:middle line:90%
starting to come back to you.

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:54.323 align:middle line:84%
Do you think at that
time you were fully

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:90%
aware of what was going on?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was absolutely
not fully aware

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:57.493 align:middle line:90%
of what was going on.

00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:58.536 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not fully aware.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.162 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, I was not.

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:01.205 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:02.707 align:middle line:84%
They don't give you
full disclosure.

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.333 align:middle line:84%
They don't tell you
that they're going

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:08.212 align:middle line:84%
to mind wipe you and erase the
20 years that you were gone.

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:11.215 align:middle line:84%
On certain levels, you still
retain that information,

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:13.092 align:middle line:84%
in the higher
levels of yourself.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.635 align:middle line:84%
That information is
still there, even

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:17.513 align:middle line:84%
though the chemistry of the
physical body, it's gone.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:10%
But the memories
are still there.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.641 align:middle line:84%
And what they don't
count on is they

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:25.896 align:middle line:84%
don't count on that after the 20
years, memories are returning.

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:30.443 align:middle line:84%
If they had told me everything,
if they hadn't lied,

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.321 align:middle line:84%
I probably would have
made a different decision.

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.573 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
feel at this point

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.158 align:middle line:90%
that they cheated with you?

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:40.786 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Oh, they messed
with me big time, George.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:43.581 align:middle line:84%
Part of the process
that you go through

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:48.085 align:middle line:84%
is they learn everything
about you, all your buttons,

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:52.381 align:middle line:84%
all your motivators, everything
and anything physically,

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:56.927 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, mentally, that
works and doesn't work for you.

00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:59.221 align:middle line:84%
So as part of the
out-processing,

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:00.639 align:middle line:90%
they make sure--

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:06.187 align:middle line:84%
another level of their
diabolical planning

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:11.108 align:middle line:84%
and controlling this information
is if you start getting close

00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:13.319 align:middle line:84%
to the truth and
asking these questions,

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:16.781 align:middle line:84%
protocols kick in within
yourself for self-destructive

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:19.700 align:middle line:84%
behavior, for
self-destructive things that--

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:90%
you think, why am I doing this?

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.788 align:middle line:84%
But you end up
getting so distracted

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:84%
that you're too
busy to even think

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.626 align:middle line:84%
about some crazy
government conspiracy.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.586 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've got
to tell you, Jason, I've

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:34.131 align:middle line:84%
interviewed thousands
and thousands of people.

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:40.221 align:middle line:84%
And I am not picking up from
you any kind of deception.

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.139 align:middle line:84%
It's a bizarre
story, to be sure.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:42.973 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: To be sure.

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:44.642 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm
looking forward to when

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:47.353 align:middle line:84%
they hypnotize you and try to
see if they can get some more

00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:49.146 align:middle line:90%
information out of you.

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:52.358 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not picking up
anything of deceit or anything

00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:53.818 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.654 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
commend you for that.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:57.822 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Well, thank you.

00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.324 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late whistleblower
William Tompkins, of course,

00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:04.328 align:middle line:84%
said on Gaia's "Cosmic
Disclosure" a little bit

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:07.039 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.874 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM TOMPKINS:
They finished their Navy

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:12.753 align:middle line:10%
20-year tour, and they make
the selection to go back

00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:13.838 align:middle line:10%
to United States.

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:15.673 align:middle line:10%
Now remember, during
that 20 years,

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:20.302 align:middle line:10%
they had no contact with
their family or with anybody

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:21.512 align:middle line:10%
back on Earth.

00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:24.974 align:middle line:10%
That's a prerequisite.

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.475 align:middle line:10%
But they remember the family.

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:28.811 align:middle line:10%
They remember their
friends and the people

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:10%
they used to go to and
some of the girlfriends

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.857 align:middle line:10%
they used to have.

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:35.526 align:middle line:10%
And so they come back.

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:10%
But they were 20 years older
when they left the planet.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.205 align:middle line:10%
So the girlfriends are going
to be a whole lot older.

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:54.336 align:middle line:10%
And so the Navy has allowed
them, in the Solar Warden

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:58.883 align:middle line:10%
System Program, to
go back to the age

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:00.718 align:middle line:10%
that they were when
they signed up.

00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:04.555 align:middle line:10%
Well, you said they were 20
years old when they signed up.

00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:06.891 align:middle line:10%
And they went a
20-year Navy tour.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:10.102 align:middle line:10%
They came back, and now
they're 20 years old.

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:13.856 align:middle line:10%
And they are in
a situation where

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:19.278 align:middle line:10%
life is this 20-year-old
life that they

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:10%
had going when they left.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:31.957 align:middle line:10%
And now, during that
several weeks returning,

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:37.463 align:middle line:10%
their minds, not
painfully, but their minds

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:45.804 align:middle line:10%
are played with to where 90.99
of their memory for the last 20

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:50.559 align:middle line:10%
years out in space is removed.

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.936 align:middle line:10%
So they're sitting there now.

00:21:56.273 --> 00:22:00.486 align:middle line:10%
The girlfriend is the
same age as she was.

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:01.278 align:middle line:10%
Wait a minute.

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:05.115 align:middle line:10%
She wasn't 20 years
older like we said.

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:08.327 align:middle line:10%
She's still the same age.

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:11.789 align:middle line:10%
If he was married, his wife,
the kids, were the same age.

00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:10%
They didn't spend
20 years more life.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:20.464 align:middle line:10%
So he comes-- that's
kind of a cool system.

00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:22.716 align:middle line:10%
Yes, that system is
operating and has

00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:28.055 align:middle line:10%
been operating since 1980.

00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now that's
bizarre, Jason.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.433 align:middle line:90%
Is that what happened to you?

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:33.143 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's very well spoken.

00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:34.311 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same kind of thing.

00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:35.187 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Same concept.

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:37.648 align:middle line:84%
Except he said that it wasn't
painful, and my memories

00:22:37.648 --> 00:22:38.148 align:middle line:90%
of the process--

00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:38.399 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was.

00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:39.483 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --are
actually very painful.

00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:40.901 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I was
going to ask you

00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:43.654 align:middle line:84%
if you think something
was so horrendous that

00:22:43.654 --> 00:22:46.615 align:middle line:84%
may have occurred that
that's the reason why

00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:48.325 align:middle line:90%
they have to brainwash you.

00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:51.328 align:middle line:84%
Because it was maybe
you saw some kind

00:22:51.328 --> 00:22:54.999 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials that
were evil or something

00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:59.003 align:middle line:84%
horrible happened, and that the
only way you could cope with it

00:22:59.003 --> 00:23:00.504 align:middle line:90%
is to forget about it.

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:01.297 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:02.965 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's a very
interesting point.

00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:05.551 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there were some
very horrible things

00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:07.177 align:middle line:84%
that we had to go
through, that we

00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:09.847 align:middle line:84%
had to see, that
we had to endure,

00:23:09.847 --> 00:23:11.849 align:middle line:90%
that we had to live through.

00:23:11.849 --> 00:23:15.269 align:middle line:84%
And no, that's not the
reason why they wiped it.

00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:18.188 align:middle line:84%
The reason they wiped it was
for operational securities.

00:23:18.188 --> 00:23:19.732 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
do that with drugs?

00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:20.816 align:middle line:90%
How do you think they do that?

00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:23.402 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They do that through a
combination of pharmaceuticals

00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:29.867 align:middle line:10%
The process that I went through
involved what very similarly

00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:10%
looks to like a dentist's chair.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.831 align:middle line:84%
But you're plugged into all
kinds of pharmaceuticals.

00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:39.001 align:middle line:10%
And they use scalar
waves and a number

00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:45.883 align:middle line:10%
of other types of radiation
or other medical processes

00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:50.846 align:middle line:10%
to, for me, clean my system
of the nanite and enhancements

00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:55.726 align:middle line:10%
that they gave us,
but also to age

00:23:55.726 --> 00:23:59.146 align:middle line:10%
regress us back to the
point from which we

00:23:59.146 --> 00:24:00.814 align:middle line:10%
left our original timeline.

00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:03.692 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, what
are screen memories?

00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:06.403 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Screen memories
are implanted memories

00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:11.492 align:middle line:84%
that they give you to replace
the blank that they take away.

00:24:11.492 --> 00:24:17.247 align:middle line:84%
For instance, my training
during childhood.

00:24:17.247 --> 00:24:18.999 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want me
remembering and going

00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:20.417 align:middle line:84%
home and talking about it
around the dinner table.

00:24:20.417 --> 00:24:22.252 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't want to
tell mom and dad, did they?

00:24:22.252 --> 00:24:22.336 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Right.

00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:23.212 align:middle line:90%
Hey, guess what?

00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:25.464 align:middle line:84%
I was at an Air Force
or Navy base today.

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:27.424 align:middle line:84%
And they had me working
with other kids,

00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:29.760 align:middle line:84%
and I was talking to them
through these special devices.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.803 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I'm going to Mars.

00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:31.637 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Right, yeah.

00:24:31.637 --> 00:24:35.057 align:middle line:84%
So they will come in and
mind wipe that portion--

00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:36.517 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Screen
you out, basically.

00:24:36.517 --> 00:24:38.018 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah, erase it.

00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:40.187 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll come back
in with that blank slate

00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:44.733 align:middle line:84%
that they've just created and
say, you were at the aquarium.

00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:45.984 align:middle line:90%
You saw this shark.

00:24:45.984 --> 00:24:47.069 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
what you remember.

00:24:47.069 --> 00:24:48.612 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And that's
what you remember.

00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:51.573 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you really want to
remember what happened to you?

00:24:51.573 --> 00:24:53.909 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: You know, that's a
really good question, George.

00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:57.955 align:middle line:84%
And when I first started
waking up, I was so angry.

00:24:57.955 --> 00:25:00.374 align:middle line:84%
I said, gosh, I want
to remember everything.

00:25:00.374 --> 00:25:04.086 align:middle line:84%
Darn it, they took all this
from me and did all this to me.

00:25:04.086 --> 00:25:06.088 align:middle line:84%
Part of the personal
growth that you

00:25:06.088 --> 00:25:08.132 align:middle line:84%
have to do, the
personal work that I'm

00:25:08.132 --> 00:25:11.051 align:middle line:90%
convinced that you have to do--

00:25:11.051 --> 00:25:17.516 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that I don't
really want to know all

00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:19.351 align:middle line:90%
until it's the right time.

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.395 align:middle line:84%
Because some of the
things I'm not ready for.

00:25:21.395 --> 00:25:22.896 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You might not be
able to handle the truth,

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:22.938 align:middle line:90%
as they say.

00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:23.981 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I might not.

00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the things
that have come back to me

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.152 align:middle line:90%
have been very painful.

00:25:28.152 --> 00:25:30.362 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
things, originally, I

00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:32.197 align:middle line:84%
had to take a step
back for six weeks

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.615 align:middle line:90%
because it was so painful.

00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:37.161 align:middle line:84%
It was so emotionally
disturbing to me.

00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:40.164 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you tell
friends about this?

00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:42.541 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I've told some
close friends about this.

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:43.792 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they think?

00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.505 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The close
friends that I've told,

00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:50.591 align:middle line:84%
I have been very
selective about it.

00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:52.676 align:middle line:90%
And so they've been supportive.

00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:55.387 align:middle line:90%
They've been interested.

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:56.388 align:middle line:10%
They've been open to it.

00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:58.098 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
concerned about you?

00:25:58.098 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They have been
concerned about me.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.852 align:middle line:84%
They've been concerned
about my safety

00:26:01.852 --> 00:26:04.146 align:middle line:84%
and, hey, what's going to
happen to you if you come out

00:26:04.146 --> 00:26:06.398 align:middle line:90%
and talk about this?

00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:07.691 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have you weighed that?

00:26:07.691 --> 00:26:08.525 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I have.

00:26:08.525 --> 00:26:09.693 align:middle line:90%
I've weighed that.

00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:12.362 align:middle line:10%
And part of this
growth process has

00:26:12.362 --> 00:26:16.158 align:middle line:10%
been re-evaluating
my definition,

00:26:16.158 --> 00:26:18.202 align:middle line:10%
my own personal definition,
of life and death

00:26:18.202 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:10%
and what the value of that is.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.246 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You need to
be careful, Jason.

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:25.417 align:middle line:84%
Because if they have taken
the extremes to play with

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:29.463 align:middle line:84%
your mind, erase as much
as they think they can,

00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:31.173 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
go public with this--

00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:84%
and you're starting
to, obviously,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:84%
on programs like this
and everything else--

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.346 align:middle line:90%
they could shut you up--

00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:38.347 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure they could.

00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:39.056 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --in their
own little way.

00:26:39.056 --> 00:26:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you concerned about that?

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:41.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:42.851 align:middle line:84%
Of course I'm
concerned about it.

00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:45.187 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you always
looking over your shoulder?

00:26:45.187 --> 00:26:45.979 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It's funny.

00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:48.065 align:middle line:84%
Hearing Corey talk
about having firearms

00:26:48.065 --> 00:26:50.442 align:middle line:84%
placed at different
places around the house,

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:52.194 align:middle line:84%
I had to laugh when
I heard that episode.

00:26:52.194 --> 00:26:54.988 align:middle line:84%
Because that was
during my awakening

00:26:54.988 --> 00:26:57.491 align:middle line:84%
process, and I hadn't
really put pieces together.

00:26:57.491 --> 00:27:00.828 align:middle line:84%
But I had already
been doing that.

00:27:00.828 --> 00:27:04.248 align:middle line:84%
I was no more than an arm's
reach away from a firearm.

00:27:04.248 --> 00:27:05.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just in case.

00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:06.542 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Just in case.

00:27:06.542 --> 00:27:12.005 align:middle line:84%
And so it gets back to the
same concept of terrorism.

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:15.092 align:middle line:84%
Do you not go outside
because you're so afraid?

00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:15.968 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:19.346 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced that
we still have to carry on

00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:23.225 align:middle line:84%
and try and spread as
much love in just anything

00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:25.352 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing, take
care of ourselves.

00:27:25.352 --> 00:27:29.273 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know you're
out of the Secret Space Program

00:27:29.273 --> 00:27:30.607 align:middle line:90%
and that you're not still in it?

00:27:30.607 --> 00:27:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And that
I'm not still in it?

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.029 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that the way
that I know I'm out

00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:38.407 align:middle line:84%
is that if I was still in,
I wouldn't have the health

00:27:38.407 --> 00:27:40.951 align:middle line:84%
issues that I've got, is that
they would take care of that.

00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:42.244 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's wrong with you?

00:27:42.244 --> 00:27:44.329 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I've got neck
and back problems.

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:45.581 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Caused by?

00:27:45.581 --> 00:27:48.584 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think that
there is definitely

00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:51.461 align:middle line:84%
some origin in the
Secret Space Program.

00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:53.964 align:middle line:84%
The technology that
they used for healing,

00:27:53.964 --> 00:27:56.925 align:middle line:84%
while it is far beyond
anything that we could ever

00:27:56.925 --> 00:28:01.388 align:middle line:84%
see in any hospital on Earth,
it still has its limitations.

00:28:01.388 --> 00:28:05.434 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that they were
able to fix me up almost as good

00:28:05.434 --> 00:28:08.562 align:middle line:84%
as new, but there were
still some defects.

00:28:08.562 --> 00:28:10.355 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the
problems that I've had

00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:14.359 align:middle line:84%
have been exacerbated because
of the original injuries.

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:16.528 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't
they heal you?

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:20.282 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they use Star
Trekkian medicine-- right?

00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:21.158 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:23.327 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And wave a wand
right over your back.

00:28:23.327 --> 00:28:26.538 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, in some ways,
that's close to what they do.

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:28.957 align:middle line:90%
But they're not gods.

00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:32.502 align:middle line:84%
They're still humans with
very advanced technology.

00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:36.381 align:middle line:84%
And humans by definition
are not perfect.

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And so any technology that
they've acquired or made

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.470 align:middle line:90%
is still not perfect.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.013 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
not there quite yet.

00:28:43.013 --> 00:28:44.348 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Not there yet.

00:28:44.348 --> 00:28:45.349 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might you
have been involved

00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:47.684 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of spacecraft
crash or something like that?

00:28:47.684 --> 00:28:50.187 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Pretty sure that
that was the origin of it.

00:28:50.187 --> 00:28:52.606 align:middle line:90%
But the information is sketchy.

00:28:52.606 --> 00:28:53.565 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to learn more.

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:55.734 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the things I
want to learn more about,

00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.694 align:middle line:10%
is the origins of that,
as well as the shrapnel

00:28:57.694 --> 00:28:58.904 align:middle line:10%
that I've got in my body.

00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:01.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you were in for 20.

00:29:01.365 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And then did you go
back for a little bit?

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.827 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was in for
my first 20 and Back.

00:29:05.827 --> 00:29:08.872 align:middle line:90%
That started when I was at 13.

00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:11.166 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I know
that it was that year

00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:14.044 align:middle line:10%
was because that was the
final year of my training.

00:29:14.044 --> 00:29:18.966 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that point
that my maturity level

00:29:18.966 --> 00:29:20.634 align:middle line:90%
changed drastically, overnight.

00:29:20.634 --> 00:29:22.344 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You went from
a kid to an adult.

00:29:22.344 --> 00:29:24.596 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I went from a
kid to an adult., yup.

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:27.849 align:middle line:84%
I missed 186 out of 250
something days of school

00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:28.684 align:middle line:90%
that year.

00:29:28.684 --> 00:29:31.395 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're
regressed back age wise,

00:29:31.395 --> 00:29:34.606 align:middle line:84%
do you go back into
time 20 years ago?

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:35.524 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:29:35.524 --> 00:29:38.944 align:middle line:84%
Part of out-processing from
the 20 and Back program

00:29:38.944 --> 00:29:44.408 align:middle line:84%
is that the timeline that they
originally picked you from,

00:29:44.408 --> 00:29:48.704 align:middle line:84%
separated you from,
you're taken back to that.

00:29:48.704 --> 00:29:52.749 align:middle line:84%
And so when they return you
to your original timeline,

00:29:52.749 --> 00:29:54.126 align:middle line:90%
they age regress you.

00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:58.338 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned, for me
it was a painful experience.

00:29:58.338 --> 00:30:01.591 align:middle line:84%
It was about 10
days worth of hell.

00:30:01.591 --> 00:30:04.261 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
go through it again?

00:30:04.261 --> 00:30:06.263 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: If I
absolutely had to, yes.

00:30:06.263 --> 00:30:09.516 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But do you
actually feel that age when

00:30:09.516 --> 00:30:12.102 align:middle line:90%
they take you back 20 years?

00:30:12.102 --> 00:30:14.187 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: You don't remember it.

00:30:14.187 --> 00:30:15.981 align:middle line:84%
But there are parts
of your higher

00:30:15.981 --> 00:30:20.068 align:middle line:84%
self, parts of the self
that do recall that.

00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:22.112 align:middle line:84%
It changes you,
absolutely changes you.

00:30:22.112 --> 00:30:24.865 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then they bring
you back to the reality of time?

00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:27.617 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They bring you back
to the original timeline

00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:30.037 align:middle line:84%
where you departed
from, drop you off.

00:30:30.037 --> 00:30:31.121 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:32.748 align:middle line:90%
Go back living your life.

00:30:32.748 --> 00:30:34.291 align:middle line:84%
We're going to watch
you for a while.

00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:36.251 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how do you
know you're out of it?

00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:36.918 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: How do I know that I'm--

00:30:36.918 --> 00:30:39.087 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That you're not
in the program anymore.

00:30:39.087 --> 00:30:42.299 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Well, aside
from being fed--

00:30:42.299 --> 00:30:45.427 align:middle line:10%
well, if I was still
in, the memories

00:30:45.427 --> 00:30:48.805 align:middle line:10%
that I've got of my daily
activities, they would.

00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:52.017 align:middle line:90%
not be as complete as they are.

00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:56.772 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is, since my awakening,

00:30:56.772 --> 00:31:01.026 align:middle line:84%
doing the person work,
remembering more, and paying

00:31:01.026 --> 00:31:03.195 align:middle line:84%
attention to the
here and now allows

00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:04.821 align:middle line:84%
me to remember more
of what's going on.

00:31:04.821 --> 00:31:05.697 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The screen memories
that they use, there's gaps.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.995 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of gaps.

00:31:11.995 --> 00:31:16.166 align:middle line:10%
And so when you have gaps
in your daily activity--

00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:17.334 align:middle line:10%
sometimes you space out.

00:31:17.334 --> 00:31:18.960 align:middle line:10%
And you're driving
to work, and you

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.378 align:middle line:10%
don't remember a
particular field

00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:22.172 align:middle line:10%
that you've driven
by every single day

00:31:22.172 --> 00:31:24.174 align:middle line:10%
work for the last two years.

00:31:24.174 --> 00:31:26.218 align:middle line:84%
And you go, wow, how
long has that been there?

00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:27.761 align:middle line:84%
And the person next
to you says, man,

00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:29.638 align:middle line:90%
that's been there for 10 years.

00:31:29.638 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
right under your nose.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.349 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And it's
right under your nose.

00:31:32.349 --> 00:31:34.476 align:middle line:84%
It's those kind of
gaps that you can

00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:37.896 align:middle line:84%
look at from your daily
activities and say, OK,

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:39.689 align:middle line:84%
do I remember picking
up my toothbrush?

00:31:39.689 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.317 align:middle line:84%
Do I remember putting
toothpaste on it?

00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:42.943 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:31:42.943 --> 00:31:44.361 align:middle line:90%
Do I remember buckling my belt?

00:31:44.361 --> 00:31:45.278 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:31:45.278 --> 00:31:48.698 align:middle line:10%
Those little things that
they don't put generally

00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:52.035 align:middle line:10%
in screen memories is how I
know that I'm not still in it.

00:31:52.035 --> 00:31:54.579 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were a second
lieutenant in the United States

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:55.705 align:middle line:90%
Army for how long?

00:31:55.705 --> 00:31:57.082 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I was a
second lieutenant

00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:59.209 align:middle line:90%
for all of about eight months.

00:31:59.209 --> 00:32:01.878 align:middle line:10%
And that was my whole
goal through college,

00:32:01.878 --> 00:32:03.547 align:middle line:10%
was to make a career
out of the US Army.

00:32:03.547 --> 00:32:05.423 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how did
you get out of the Army?

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:09.219 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I had medical issues
that I was honorably discharged

00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:10.554 align:middle line:90%
from the service for.

00:32:10.554 --> 00:32:13.098 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're done
with the military now.

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, yes, I am
finished with the military.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.728 align:middle line:84%
However, there is a
particular document

00:32:18.728 --> 00:32:21.773 align:middle line:84%
that I have that has an
indefinite expiration date.

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:25.527 align:middle line:84%
It's my ID card that I
was originally issued.

00:32:25.527 --> 00:32:27.279 align:middle line:84%
Almost all ID cards
that I've ever seen--

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.989 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So technically,
you're still in.

00:32:28.989 --> 00:32:31.241 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, it could
be said that I am.

00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:34.578 align:middle line:84%
I think that that was one of
the mistakes that was made,

00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:37.831 align:middle line:84%
one of the human errors, was
that they forgot to get that

00:32:37.831 --> 00:32:39.082 align:middle line:90%
or forgot to get that changed.

00:32:39.082 --> 00:32:41.001 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Get your 20 in
and get your retirement out

00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:41.585 align:middle line:90%
of it, Jason.

00:32:41.585 --> 00:32:42.544 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's what I said.

00:32:42.544 --> 00:32:43.003 align:middle line:90%
But nope.

00:32:43.003 --> 00:32:43.753 align:middle line:84%
No, that wasn't
part of the deal.

00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:44.838 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's not
going to happen?

00:32:44.838 --> 00:32:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:50.051 align:middle line:84%
During the original
in-processing at the Fort

00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:54.264 align:middle line:84%
Indiantown Gap facility that I
was at, the original briefing

00:32:54.264 --> 00:32:59.102 align:middle line:84%
included a large
section on your pay,

00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:00.520 align:middle line:90%
how much you would be banking--

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.272 align:middle line:84%
because you obviously
can't spend it

00:33:02.272 --> 00:33:05.108 align:middle line:84%
when you're off planet
somewhere-- and the tens

00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:06.860 align:middle line:84%
of hundreds of
thousands of dollars

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.612 align:middle line:84%
that you would
acquire after 20 years

00:33:08.612 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:84%
that would be available
to you when you return.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.157 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And of course,
you've gotten all of it.

00:33:12.157 --> 00:33:12.699 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Not a dime.

00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:13.491 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:14.326 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a dime.

00:33:14.326 --> 00:33:15.243 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Not a dime.

00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:16.536 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will you ever collect?

00:33:16.536 --> 00:33:18.288 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:33:18.288 --> 00:33:19.706 align:middle line:90%
I'm not counting on that.

00:33:19.706 --> 00:33:20.832 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:23.668 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:26.463 align:middle line:84%
I said earlier, I wouldn't
be the person I am today

00:33:26.463 --> 00:33:28.131 align:middle line:84%
if I hadn't gone
through the experiences

00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:29.299 align:middle line:90%
that I've gone through.

00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:32.093 align:middle line:84%
And I value that much
more than any money.

00:33:32.093 --> 00:33:34.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say to someone

00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:38.475 align:middle line:84%
who has been put through
a program like this, who

00:33:38.475 --> 00:33:41.811 align:middle line:84%
is at a point where they're just
beginning to understand what

00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:42.979 align:middle line:90%
happened to them?

00:33:42.979 --> 00:33:44.439 align:middle line:90%
How would you help them?

00:33:44.439 --> 00:33:45.941 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's a
very good question.

00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:50.737 align:middle line:84%
And I in many ways wish
that I'd had somebody that

00:33:50.737 --> 00:33:52.280 align:middle line:90%
could have done that for me.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:56.576 align:middle line:84%
And the response that
I would give is--

00:33:56.576 --> 00:33:58.078 align:middle line:90%
do the personal work.

00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:00.080 align:middle line:84%
That's more important
than anything else,

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.084 align:middle line:84%
than any memories, than any
"what happened to me" question.

00:34:04.084 --> 00:34:05.752 align:middle line:90%
Do the personal work.

00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:06.544 align:middle line:90%
Work on yourself.

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:07.754 align:middle line:90%
Find out the whys.

00:34:07.754 --> 00:34:09.005 align:middle line:90%
Why are you angry about it?

00:34:09.005 --> 00:34:09.797 align:middle line:84%
Why are you angry
that they lied to you?

00:34:09.797 --> 00:34:11.841 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they will
get angry, won't they?

00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:16.846 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Of course, on one
of those seven or nine

00:34:16.846 --> 00:34:18.681 align:middle line:90%
stages that you go through.

00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:20.433 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it fixable for them?

00:34:20.433 --> 00:34:21.643 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Absolutely it is.

00:34:21.643 --> 00:34:22.978 align:middle line:90%
You're not broken beyond repair.

00:34:22.978 --> 00:34:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or alone.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.313 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Or alone.

00:34:25.313 --> 00:34:27.357 align:middle line:90%
And you're not going crazy.

00:34:27.357 --> 00:34:31.485 align:middle line:84%
And the best thing to do
is do the personal work.

00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:34.197 align:middle line:84%
Find a counselor
if you need help

00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:38.827 align:middle line:84%
to talk to that's not going to
want to institutionalize you.

00:34:38.827 --> 00:34:40.786 align:middle line:84%
And you can be selective
about the counselor

00:34:40.786 --> 00:34:45.125 align:middle line:84%
that you go find, or a
good friend or somebody

00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:48.962 align:middle line:84%
that you can discuss with
in an impartial manner.

00:34:48.962 --> 00:34:49.920 align:middle line:90%
Do the personal work.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.589 align:middle line:90%
Meditation.

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Look at what you're
doing everyday.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.677 align:middle line:84%
Look at the
self-destructive behaviors

00:34:55.677 --> 00:34:58.888 align:middle line:84%
that you're either
avoiding or putting off.

00:34:58.888 --> 00:35:00.890 align:middle line:90%
And find a balance for them.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:04.894 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you dealing with
a counselor who just gets you?

00:35:04.894 --> 00:35:08.148 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I have in the
past, but not currently.

00:35:08.148 --> 00:35:09.649 align:middle line:90%
Not currently.

00:35:09.649 --> 00:35:13.528 align:middle line:84%
The personal work that
I've been able to do

00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:22.245 align:middle line:84%
I'd say over the last year
has been heavily self guided.

00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:24.956 align:middle line:84%
And it requires a tremendous
amount of discipline

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:27.292 align:middle line:84%
and doing your own
work, your own homework,

00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:28.585 align:middle line:90%
your own discernment.

00:35:28.585 --> 00:35:30.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
information out there,

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.839 align:middle line:84%
and you have to be discerning
on what you take in

00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:34.924 align:middle line:90%
and what you reject.

00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:36.926 align:middle line:90%
Parts here, parts there.

00:35:36.926 --> 00:35:42.057 align:middle line:84%
And when you get better at
listening to your higher self,

00:35:42.057 --> 00:35:43.516 align:middle line:84%
or when you get
better at listening

00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:47.437 align:middle line:84%
to what your heart's
telling you, you get better.

00:35:47.437 --> 00:35:49.814 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in no way perfect at it.

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:54.069 align:middle line:84%
I'm still learning, as I think
the human journey is part

00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:56.446 align:middle line:84%
of that, is that you're learning
the whole time if you're

00:35:56.446 --> 00:35:57.489 align:middle line:90%
open to it.

00:35:57.489 --> 00:35:58.782 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You feel violated.

00:35:58.782 --> 00:35:59.574 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:35:59.574 --> 00:36:01.951 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's going on with
a number of other people.

00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:03.620 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel about
the fact that they

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.705 align:middle line:84%
may be doing this with
other little youngsters?

00:36:05.705 --> 00:36:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Oh, it's terrible.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:07.749 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Training them along.

00:36:07.749 --> 00:36:09.584 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I have worried
about that very thing

00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:10.794 align:middle line:90%
with my own children.

00:36:10.794 --> 00:36:12.962 align:middle line:90%
Was it done to them?

00:36:12.962 --> 00:36:15.799 align:middle line:84%
Are my children going
through any of this?

00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:19.469 align:middle line:10%
Because how many other kids
have to go through the mind

00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:24.391 align:middle line:10%
wipes and the violations
and seeing the things

00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:25.809 align:middle line:10%
that they put them through?

00:36:25.809 --> 00:36:28.144 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the training
procedures that they do,

00:36:28.144 --> 00:36:32.190 align:middle line:90%
George, is they expose you.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:35.902 align:middle line:84%
Because they've explored
your entire psyche,

00:36:35.902 --> 00:36:38.488 align:middle line:84%
they know everything
you're afraid of.

00:36:38.488 --> 00:36:41.032 align:middle line:84%
So if you're afraid
of being burned alive,

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:45.370 align:middle line:84%
through extensive virtual
reality, you get burned alive.

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.080 align:middle line:84%
If you're afraid of
drowning, guess what?

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:47.747 align:middle line:90%
You get to drown.

00:36:47.747 --> 00:36:49.124 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They mind
play with you.

00:36:49.124 --> 00:36:51.626 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They mind play with
you through every single one

00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:52.419 align:middle line:90%
of your fears.

00:36:52.419 --> 00:36:53.753 align:middle line:90%
All of them-- falling, drowning.

00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:54.963 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're
afraid of demons,

00:36:54.963 --> 00:36:56.005 align:middle line:84%
they'll put them in your
brain and stuff like that.

00:36:56.005 --> 00:36:57.006 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Bugs, snakes.

00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:58.466 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:36:58.466 --> 00:37:00.135 align:middle line:84%
They put you through
every one of them.

00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:01.928 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't like
snakes or spiders.

00:37:01.928 --> 00:37:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So they'd be all over
me, wouldn't they?

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.764 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I still
don't like spiders.

00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:04.889 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.099 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What, they
try to break you?

00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Is that what they do?

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:13.106 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They're trying to
desensitize you so that, if you

00:37:13.106 --> 00:37:16.985 align:middle line:84%
are in a situation where
you have physical issues

00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:21.906 align:middle line:84%
or you have challenges,
that you can call on that

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:24.367 align:middle line:90%
and say, OK, that was my fear.

00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:25.910 align:middle line:90%
I overcame it.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.579 align:middle line:90%
I can overcome this.

00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:29.372 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's assume
for a moment, Jason,

00:37:29.372 --> 00:37:32.709 align:middle line:84%
that there was one person
responsible for watching you,

00:37:32.709 --> 00:37:35.211 align:middle line:90%
for training you.

00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:37.797 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were in their
30s when you were 2.

00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:40.884 align:middle line:84%
They're probably dead now
and they've been replaced.

00:37:40.884 --> 00:37:42.844 align:middle line:84%
But if you had that
opportunity to confront

00:37:42.844 --> 00:37:46.473 align:middle line:84%
that person, that person who
was responsible for doing

00:37:46.473 --> 00:37:50.059 align:middle line:84%
all this to you in the program,
what would you say to them?

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:52.061 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: I'd tell
them it was wrong.

00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:52.896 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:52.896 --> 00:37:53.897 align:middle line:90%
I forgive them.

00:37:53.897 --> 00:37:55.106 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do forgive them?

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:56.232 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:37:56.232 --> 00:37:59.068 align:middle line:84%
And that was a really
hard thing to come to.

00:37:59.068 --> 00:38:01.404 align:middle line:84%
Because I wouldn't be
the person I am today

00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:04.032 align:middle line:84%
if I hadn't gone through
everything I had to go through.

00:38:04.032 --> 00:38:05.533 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
had crying nights?

00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:06.451 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Of course.

00:38:06.451 --> 00:38:09.412 align:middle line:84%
Waking up in tears,
or days that you just

00:38:09.412 --> 00:38:10.955 align:middle line:90%
want to ball up in a corner.

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:12.123 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:14.709 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The recollection that
is starting to come back to you

00:38:14.709 --> 00:38:18.630 align:middle line:84%
now, what is probably one of
the most dramatic things you

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.633 align:middle line:84%
can tell us today
that you can recall?

00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:24.594 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Seeing a planetary
bombardment by a kinetic energy

00:38:24.594 --> 00:38:27.180 align:middle line:90%
weapon and seeing--

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.097 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:38:28.097 --> 00:38:29.641 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --thousands
of people killed.

00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:30.767 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where?

00:38:30.767 --> 00:38:33.394 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: This was during
deployment on another planet.

00:38:33.394 --> 00:38:35.647 align:middle line:10%
Part of our mission
was to help--

00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:39.609 align:middle line:10%
because the program
that I was involved with

00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:42.612 align:middle line:10%
was a false flag operation
from the top down.

00:38:42.612 --> 00:38:47.325 align:middle line:10%
The alien entities
that were in charge

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:53.623 align:middle line:10%
of wanting to gain control
over other planets,

00:38:53.623 --> 00:38:57.627 align:middle line:10%
they're not very
attractive to most beings.

00:38:57.627 --> 00:38:58.962 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In terms of appearance?

00:38:58.962 --> 00:39:00.338 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They're
scarier than hell.

00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:01.464 align:middle line:90%
They look like demons.

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of describe
what they look like.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.679 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: If you've seen any
devil or demon in a Western

00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:09.597 align:middle line:90%
Christian--

00:39:09.597 --> 00:39:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With horns and--

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.432 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Horns and tails.

00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:13.059 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --those
funny tails and stuff.

00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:14.227 align:middle line:90%
That's what they look like?

00:39:14.227 --> 00:39:15.019 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Very close.

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.938 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then maybe the
description biblically

00:39:16.938 --> 00:39:18.273 align:middle line:90%
may have been them.

00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:19.315 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It probably was.

00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:20.692 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced it was.

00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:22.151 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:27.156 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They are the ones that
are interacting with the humans

00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:28.575 align:middle line:90%
calling the shots.

00:39:28.575 --> 00:39:32.829 align:middle line:84%
And what they were doing is
they were using humanoids

00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:35.248 align:middle line:84%
under the false threat
of an alien invasion

00:39:35.248 --> 00:39:36.499 align:middle line:90%
on other planets.

00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:37.875 align:middle line:84%
Because the other
planets thought

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:39.335 align:middle line:84%
that they were
going to get invaded

00:39:39.335 --> 00:39:41.170 align:middle line:90%
by some mean evil aliens.

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.463 align:middle line:90%
And we show up.

00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.674 align:middle line:90%
We're here to help.

00:39:44.674 --> 00:39:45.508 align:middle line:90%
Well, absolutely.

00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:47.385 align:middle line:84%
They have far beyond
our technology.

00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:49.137 align:middle line:84%
There's no way we
could stand up to them.

00:39:49.137 --> 00:39:50.179 align:middle line:90%
What can you do for us?

00:39:50.179 --> 00:39:51.681 align:middle line:90%
There's the foot in the door.

00:39:51.681 --> 00:39:52.640 align:middle line:90%
We're invited in.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.308 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Help us.

00:39:53.308 --> 00:39:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Help us.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.269 align:middle line:84%
Well, the cost of
being invited in

00:39:56.269 --> 00:40:00.356 align:middle line:84%
is you've got to turn over your
planetary control to whoever

00:40:00.356 --> 00:40:01.190 align:middle line:90%
turns out.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:02.317 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have we done that?

00:40:02.317 --> 00:40:04.444 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We've done that
on countless occasions.

00:40:04.444 --> 00:40:06.988 align:middle line:84%
Humans have helped enslave
a number of other planets

00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:08.072 align:middle line:90%
through that process.

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:10.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In our solar
system or outside of it?

00:40:10.283 --> 00:40:12.744 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Outside of our
solar system, in our galaxy.

00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:18.499 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The propulsion systems
used to get you to these places

00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:21.210 align:middle line:84%
must be way beyond
what we're using today.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:22.545 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Oh, they are.

00:40:22.545 --> 00:40:25.048 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it ET propulsion?

00:40:25.048 --> 00:40:25.882 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:27.091 align:middle line:90%
What kind of technology is it?

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.719 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was originally
reverse engineered.

00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:31.888 align:middle line:84%
I believe some of it
was channeled as far

00:40:31.888 --> 00:40:34.182 align:middle line:84%
as the information
that was originally

00:40:34.182 --> 00:40:39.687 align:middle line:84%
obtained in the '30s for
the first human devices

00:40:39.687 --> 00:40:41.981 align:middle line:84%
that were created for
anti-gravity or temporal

00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:43.816 align:middle line:90%
travel.

00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:46.486 align:middle line:84%
The Germans were
doing it in the '30s.

00:40:46.486 --> 00:40:50.323 align:middle line:84%
And so from there, that's where
the breakaway civilization

00:40:50.323 --> 00:40:51.115 align:middle line:90%
went.

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:53.743 align:middle line:84%
They took their toys and went
down to Antarctica first.

00:40:53.743 --> 00:40:55.328 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What an amazing story.

00:40:55.328 --> 00:40:57.747 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And the
rest of the planet,

00:40:57.747 --> 00:41:03.252 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the cabal planet,
it was either seeded by other

00:41:03.252 --> 00:41:04.045 align:middle line:90%
aliens--

00:41:04.045 --> 00:41:07.256 align:middle line:84%
hey, here's some
technology for you.

00:41:07.256 --> 00:41:08.841 align:middle line:84%
It's crashed and
mostly banged up,

00:41:08.841 --> 00:41:11.177 align:middle line:84%
but I think you can do
some amazing things,

00:41:11.177 --> 00:41:14.889 align:middle line:84%
like seeing in the dark
or like fiber optics.

00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:17.225 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they've learned
how to bend space and time,

00:41:17.225 --> 00:41:17.517 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:41:17.517 --> 00:41:17.809 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:19.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's how
they travel, basically

00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:21.771 align:middle line:84%
through wormholes or something
like that, instantly.

00:41:21.771 --> 00:41:23.439 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: One instant
you're in one place.

00:41:23.439 --> 00:41:24.774 align:middle line:84%
In the next instant
you're in another.

00:41:24.774 --> 00:41:25.942 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you are.

00:41:25.942 --> 00:41:29.946 align:middle line:84%
Back to Randy Cramer again,
talking about his involvement

00:41:29.946 --> 00:41:32.615 align:middle line:90%
on other planets.

00:41:32.615 --> 00:41:33.825 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I have said this--

00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:35.326 align:middle line:90%
20-year tour.

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:36.911 align:middle line:90%
20-year healing process.

00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:37.954 align:middle line:90%
Just straight up.

00:41:37.954 --> 00:41:39.580 align:middle line:84%
There's no other
way to look at it.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.291 align:middle line:10%
It was a 20-year tour and
a 20-year healing process

00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:47.046 align:middle line:10%
before I had a solid grip on
what the heck was going on.

00:41:47.046 --> 00:41:48.548 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the
Randy Cramer clip

00:41:48.548 --> 00:41:53.302 align:middle line:84%
that we just saw is much like
what has happened to you.

00:41:53.302 --> 00:41:55.138 align:middle line:90%
This must be a real story.

00:41:55.138 --> 00:41:56.931 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, as I
mentioned earlier,

00:41:56.931 --> 00:41:58.725 align:middle line:84%
George, where
there's enough smoke,

00:41:58.725 --> 00:41:59.934 align:middle line:90%
there's going to be a fire.

00:41:59.934 --> 00:42:03.062 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
awakening process

00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:05.982 align:middle line:84%
that many are going
through now and realizing

00:42:05.982 --> 00:42:07.900 align:middle line:90%
there is a shadow government--

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:11.487 align:middle line:84%
they are doing things that
are unethical, illegal,

00:42:11.487 --> 00:42:15.867 align:middle line:84%
and way beyond anything that's
ever even come out so far.

00:42:15.867 --> 00:42:17.785 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think, Jason, the purpose

00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:19.287 align:middle line:90%
is of doing this?

00:42:19.287 --> 00:42:21.789 align:middle line:90%
Why are they doing this--

00:42:21.789 --> 00:42:25.042 align:middle line:84%
grabbing kids, training
kids, doing it?

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:27.754 align:middle line:90%
Why is it so secret?

00:42:27.754 --> 00:42:31.424 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: If they let us all
know about the technologies

00:42:31.424 --> 00:42:33.843 align:middle line:84%
that they have, the
people would be clamoring

00:42:33.843 --> 00:42:35.636 align:middle line:90%
for use of that technology.

00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:36.596 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:42:36.596 --> 00:42:38.055 align:middle line:90%
I want free energy.

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:41.058 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Who doesn't
want an electric bill?

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.310 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't have to have one.

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:44.645 align:middle line:84%
We could have a small device
about the size of a shoebox

00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:46.773 align:middle line:90%
for all our power needs.

00:42:46.773 --> 00:42:48.691 align:middle line:84%
Never an electric
bill ever again.

00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:49.901 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a power outage.

00:42:49.901 --> 00:42:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Or a power outage.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.737 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
we're concerned

00:42:52.737 --> 00:42:55.239 align:middle line:84%
about the power grid going
down from an EMP attack

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:57.033 align:middle line:90%
or an X-flare from the sun.

00:42:57.033 --> 00:42:58.201 align:middle line:90%
This would help avoid that.

00:42:58.201 --> 00:42:58.993 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:42:58.993 --> 00:43:00.036 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't have that.

00:43:00.036 --> 00:43:04.874 align:middle line:84%
Or another issue is,
well, what about travel?

00:43:04.874 --> 00:43:06.876 align:middle line:84%
Well, shoot, you
could get on a shuttle

00:43:06.876 --> 00:43:09.545 align:middle line:84%
and go anywhere you wanted
to in a matter of seconds,

00:43:09.545 --> 00:43:11.088 align:middle line:90%
or minutes at the longest.

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:12.757 align:middle line:84%
You want to go to
London for lunch?

00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:13.549 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's go.

00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:14.383 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's go.

00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's go from LA to New
York in a half hour.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Or Jupiter or Saturn,
anywhere you wanted to go.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.308 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that
sounds positive.

00:43:22.308 --> 00:43:23.226 align:middle line:90%
That sounds great.

00:43:23.226 --> 00:43:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Why not do that?

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.853 align:middle line:90%
Give it to us.

00:43:25.853 --> 00:43:26.938 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's what I say.

00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:29.816 align:middle line:84%
The issue is that the
mindset of these people

00:43:29.816 --> 00:43:36.906 align:middle line:84%
is that their self-worth is
so tied up in control, feeling

00:43:36.906 --> 00:43:39.534 align:middle line:84%
like they've got this divine
right of kings, which we all

00:43:39.534 --> 00:43:43.913 align:middle line:84%
know is the hogwash that
it is, and that they

00:43:43.913 --> 00:43:45.248 align:middle line:90%
want to be separate.

00:43:45.248 --> 00:43:46.666 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
they feel special.

00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:48.793 align:middle line:84%
That's how they feel
like they have something

00:43:48.793 --> 00:43:50.545 align:middle line:84%
that other people
don't, is they're

00:43:50.545 --> 00:43:53.089 align:middle line:84%
able to have this
control over others

00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:55.174 align:middle line:84%
because they have
technology, that they're

00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:58.594 align:middle line:84%
able to use technology and
medical procedures that

00:43:58.594 --> 00:44:01.013 align:middle line:84%
are way beyond anything
that's available now.

00:44:01.013 --> 00:44:03.933 align:middle line:84%
I had skin patches that
healed wounds and melted

00:44:03.933 --> 00:44:05.184 align:middle line:90%
into the skin.

00:44:05.184 --> 00:44:09.438 align:middle line:84%
I had implants that fought
radiation or enhanced

00:44:09.438 --> 00:44:12.108 align:middle line:90%
my vision and my hearing.

00:44:12.108 --> 00:44:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Any of the five senses
were enhanced, as well as

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.991 align:middle line:90%
self-healing abilities.

00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:20.950 align:middle line:90%
That's out there.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:21.993 align:middle line:90%
It's out there today.

00:44:21.993 --> 00:44:24.328 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, you are
going to go through hypnosis.

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.955 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
take a lie detector

00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:29.667 align:middle line:84%
test to prove what you're
saying is authentic.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:33.254 align:middle line:84%
You're still going to get
people that say, you're nuts.

00:44:33.254 --> 00:44:34.046 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:44:34.046 --> 00:44:34.964 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're lying.

00:44:34.964 --> 00:44:36.716 align:middle line:90%
You're not telling us the truth.

00:44:36.716 --> 00:44:38.217 align:middle line:84%
What do you say
to them right now,

00:44:38.217 --> 00:44:41.470 align:middle line:84%
those people who may be
watching the program today?

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:42.763 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to them?

00:44:42.763 --> 00:44:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I would say to
them, do your homework.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.683 align:middle line:90%
Do your own research.

00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:49.145 align:middle line:84%
The information, the
crumbs, are out there.

00:44:49.145 --> 00:44:50.730 align:middle line:90%
They're out there right now.

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:54.066 align:middle line:90%
And connect enough of the dots.

00:44:54.066 --> 00:44:57.236 align:middle line:84%
And when the time is right,
you'll be able to see it too.

00:44:57.236 --> 00:45:00.448 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
understand how they feel?

00:45:00.448 --> 00:45:01.699 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Of course I can.

00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:02.867 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely can understand.

00:45:02.867 --> 00:45:04.243 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You felt that
way once yourself.

00:45:04.243 --> 00:45:05.745 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I felt that
way once myself.

00:45:05.745 --> 00:45:08.831 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's just a bunch
of tinfoil hat talk.

00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:10.999 align:middle line:84%
I've got bigger
things to worry about.

00:45:10.999 --> 00:45:13.169 align:middle line:90%
I've got to pay my bills.

00:45:13.169 --> 00:45:14.962 align:middle line:84%
I've got to go take
care of my health.

00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:17.173 align:middle line:84%
I've got to look out for
the security of my family.

00:45:17.173 --> 00:45:19.884 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
control program.

00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:22.511 align:middle line:84%
If you're so worried about
your safety and security

00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:24.513 align:middle line:84%
and your well-being
of your family,

00:45:24.513 --> 00:45:26.891 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to be
worried about little things

00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:29.602 align:middle line:84%
like extra technology
or conspiracy theories.

00:45:29.602 --> 00:45:32.688 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Outside of being
a whistleblower now,

00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:35.191 align:middle line:84%
have you contemplated
hiring a lawyer

00:45:35.191 --> 00:45:37.109 align:middle line:84%
to maybe go after
the government,

00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:39.487 align:middle line:84%
maybe sue them for
what they've done?

00:45:39.487 --> 00:45:42.198 align:middle line:90%
They've taken most of your life.

00:45:42.198 --> 00:45:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And they've taken
it away from you.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:46.035 align:middle line:84%
That's got to be
worth something.

00:45:46.035 --> 00:45:46.869 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It is.

00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:48.412 align:middle line:90%
There is value to that.

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:53.876 align:middle line:84%
And I think the value is going
to be in exposing the lies.

00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:57.171 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel that going
after them in a court of law

00:45:57.171 --> 00:46:01.008 align:middle line:84%
is going to be beneficial to the
awakening that needs to happen.

00:46:01.008 --> 00:46:04.553 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is that,
in order to sue the government,

00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:06.514 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get
permission from them first.

00:46:06.514 --> 00:46:08.516 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've got
to get an attorney--

00:46:08.516 --> 00:46:09.558 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's willing to do it.

00:46:09.558 --> 00:46:11.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --who's going to
be willing to take this on.

00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:13.729 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And everybody has to
stay alive for it to happen,

00:46:13.729 --> 00:46:16.482 align:middle line:90%
which doesn't always happen.

00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:18.609 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How's your life now?

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:19.819 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It's amazing.

00:46:19.819 --> 00:46:20.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're happy?

00:46:20.945 --> 00:46:21.988 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I am.

00:46:21.988 --> 00:46:22.780 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you
always have said that?

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.575 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, absolutely not.

00:46:26.575 --> 00:46:28.077 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:46:28.077 --> 00:46:32.039 align:middle line:84%
I have health issues, just like
so many millions of others.

00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:33.749 align:middle line:84%
I have struggles
every single day.

00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:34.834 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old are you?

00:46:34.834 --> 00:46:35.876 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: 46.

00:46:35.876 --> 00:46:37.712 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're still a puppy.

00:46:37.712 --> 00:46:41.716 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And I have struggles
just like everybody else.

00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:45.469 align:middle line:84%
I am no different than
anybody else in that respect.

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:50.266 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about how you
center yourself every day,

00:46:50.266 --> 00:46:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and enjoying that moment and
looking for the positive,

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.272 align:middle line:90%
looking for the love of the day.

00:46:56.272 --> 00:46:58.649 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many different
signs and signals for that.

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.609 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you able
to sleep at night?

00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:03.529 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yes, when health issues
don't keep me from sleep.

00:47:03.529 --> 00:47:04.447 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:47:04.447 --> 00:47:06.866 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I mean
your mind is calm?

00:47:06.866 --> 00:47:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.076 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:47:09.076 --> 00:47:13.456 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you concerned
that under hypnosis you're

00:47:13.456 --> 00:47:17.043 align:middle line:84%
going to get more information
that you really shouldn't get?

00:47:17.043 --> 00:47:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, and here's why.

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.131 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned a few minutes
ago that at first I

00:47:22.131 --> 00:47:24.467 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know everything,
start to finish.

00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:25.301 align:middle line:90%
Give it to me.

00:47:25.301 --> 00:47:26.469 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't blame you.

00:47:26.469 --> 00:47:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That was
my first reaction.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.222 align:middle line:84%
It was, hey, I've been
hidden from all this

00:47:30.222 --> 00:47:32.475 align:middle line:90%
for all these years.

00:47:32.475 --> 00:47:35.936 align:middle line:84%
There have been a number
of instances and messages

00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:41.150 align:middle line:84%
that I've gotten from I call
my higher self, in that, OK,

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:45.154 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ready for it, all of it.

00:47:45.154 --> 00:47:48.365 align:middle line:84%
The parts that I'm ready
for, they come to me.

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:51.952 align:middle line:84%
They come to me through
waking messages,

00:47:51.952 --> 00:47:55.164 align:middle line:84%
through flashes of
memory, through dreams,

00:47:55.164 --> 00:47:57.500 align:middle line:90%
through any number of venues.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:03.089 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been a
healing and a self process

00:48:03.089 --> 00:48:06.717 align:middle line:84%
in itself learning
that, that hey, OK--

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:08.928 align:middle line:84%
So getting back
to your question,

00:48:08.928 --> 00:48:10.596 align:middle line:84%
worrying about
whether or not some

00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:12.848 align:middle line:84%
of the things that come out
during hypnosis, if it's

00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:15.351 align:middle line:84%
going to be too much-- no,
because I know my higher self

00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:17.895 align:middle line:90%
won't allow that to happen.

00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:21.398 align:middle line:84%
Having relived some of the
memories from the experiences--

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:25.027 align:middle line:84%
you asked a few minutes ago
the most painful memory.

00:48:25.027 --> 00:48:28.114 align:middle line:84%
And having lived
through seeing and being

00:48:28.114 --> 00:48:31.033 align:middle line:84%
able to zoom in on
a kinetic energy

00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:34.453 align:middle line:84%
weapon, which is basically
a meteor of a certain size--

00:48:34.453 --> 00:48:36.831 align:middle line:84%
You get too big and you're
going to destroy a hemisphere.

00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:38.415 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what
they wanted to do.

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:40.709 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted to
take out cities around--

00:48:40.709 --> 00:48:44.046 align:middle line:84%
basically, dropping it in the
middle of the Gulf of Mexico

00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:47.091 align:middle line:84%
would take out all the cities
around the Gulf of Mexico.

00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:50.636 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
take out Atlantis?

00:48:50.636 --> 00:48:51.554 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:48:51.554 --> 00:48:53.347 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Something
happened in Atlantis.

00:48:53.347 --> 00:48:55.266 align:middle line:84%
And until we get
full disclosure,

00:48:55.266 --> 00:49:00.563 align:middle line:84%
my belief is that
Atlantis happened

00:49:00.563 --> 00:49:05.025 align:middle line:84%
to be put under ice
because of the tampering

00:49:05.025 --> 00:49:07.903 align:middle line:84%
that alien races were
doing on this planet

00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:09.280 align:middle line:90%
to the indigenous population.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.156 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:49:10.156 --> 00:49:12.283 align:middle line:84%
Are you still in
touch with anybody?

00:49:12.283 --> 00:49:13.242 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:49:13.242 --> 00:49:14.034 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Done.

00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:14.618 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Done.

00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:16.787 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you in touch
with ETs at one point?

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:17.997 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, I was.

00:49:17.997 --> 00:49:20.708 align:middle line:90%
Very early in my childhood.

00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:21.667 align:middle line:90%
I had contact.

00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For those
that you remember--

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.171 align:middle line:84%
not the demonic ones, not
the ones that looked like

00:49:25.171 --> 00:49:26.505 align:middle line:90%
the devil--

00:49:26.505 --> 00:49:27.798 align:middle line:90%
but were there good ones?

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:28.591 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:30.593 align:middle line:90%
There are many good ones.

00:49:30.593 --> 00:49:35.556 align:middle line:84%
On deployment, the indigenous
races that we dealt with, there

00:49:35.556 --> 00:49:37.933 align:middle line:90%
were some insectoids that were--

00:49:37.933 --> 00:49:40.269 align:middle line:84%
just like here, you have
good ones, you have bad ones.

00:49:40.269 --> 00:49:44.565 align:middle line:84%
You have bad apples just
like you have the good ones.

00:49:44.565 --> 00:49:47.109 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be a
pattern that's repeated

00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:48.444 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:49:48.444 --> 00:49:49.904 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason,
what are you trying

00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:54.116 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish by coming public,
by going forward with this?

00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:55.075 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:49:55.075 --> 00:49:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's a
really good question.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:03.042 align:middle line:84%
And there are three
things that I want

00:50:03.042 --> 00:50:05.794 align:middle line:84%
and the reason why
I'm doing this.

00:50:05.794 --> 00:50:12.009 align:middle line:84%
The first has to do with
getting the information out

00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:13.344 align:middle line:90%
about the Secret Space Program.

00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:14.803 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
doing that now.

00:50:14.803 --> 00:50:16.513 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, by doing that.

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:20.559 align:middle line:84%
Because humanity has been
involved in the enslavement

00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:21.810 align:middle line:90%
that I'm aware of--

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:25.814 align:middle line:84%
I know I was involved in
at least two other planets.

00:50:25.814 --> 00:50:28.734 align:middle line:84%
We've helped enslave
at least two.

00:50:28.734 --> 00:50:30.861 align:middle line:90%
And that was just my unit.

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:35.658 align:middle line:84%
And there were two divisions
that were doing this.

00:50:35.658 --> 00:50:37.493 align:middle line:84%
So there are countless
other planets out

00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:40.329 align:middle line:84%
there that humanity
has helped to enslave.

00:50:40.329 --> 00:50:42.331 align:middle line:84%
Whether we take
care of that, making

00:50:42.331 --> 00:50:46.502 align:middle line:84%
it right, tomorrow or next
year or in 1,000 years,

00:50:46.502 --> 00:50:48.629 align:middle line:84%
is something that we're
going to have to address

00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:51.006 align:middle line:90%
as a human race at some point.

00:50:51.006 --> 00:50:55.344 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did we
at Gaia find you?

00:50:55.344 --> 00:50:56.762 align:middle line:90%
Or did you find us?

00:50:56.762 --> 00:51:02.935 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I found Gaia through
the "Cosmic Disclosure"--

00:51:02.935 --> 00:51:03.727 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Program.

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:06.605 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --call for
the whistleblowers.

00:51:06.605 --> 00:51:09.066 align:middle line:84%
It was an act of synchronicity
I couldn't ignore.

00:51:09.066 --> 00:51:12.319 align:middle line:84%
It was the very next day after
a "mallet over the head,"

00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:14.905 align:middle line:90%
a-ha memory return.

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:15.698 align:middle line:90%
Very next day.

00:51:15.698 --> 00:51:16.573 align:middle line:90%
Within 12 hours.

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:19.827 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you hold
back at all before you

00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:22.788 align:middle line:90%
decided to contact us?

00:51:22.788 --> 00:51:29.003 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: I had been before
that, because I was still

00:51:29.003 --> 00:51:31.714 align:middle line:10%
putting memory pieces together.

00:51:31.714 --> 00:51:35.384 align:middle line:84%
And then, as I said, at
that one memory recollection

00:51:35.384 --> 00:51:38.721 align:middle line:90%
that came during a dream.

00:51:38.721 --> 00:51:40.389 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you pass
the lie detector

00:51:40.389 --> 00:51:44.685 align:middle line:84%
test, and if under hypnosis
more information comes out

00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:49.023 align:middle line:84%
about this, how will
you personally feel?

00:51:49.023 --> 00:51:50.941 align:middle line:84%
Travis Walton, for
example, whom I know--

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:53.569 align:middle line:84%
"Fire in the Sky,"
claims he was abducted--

00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:55.362 align:middle line:90%
passed lie detector tests.

00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:57.197 align:middle line:84%
His friends who were
with him at that time--

00:51:57.197 --> 00:51:58.032 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Also passed.

00:51:58.032 --> 00:52:00.576 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --passed
lie detector tests.

00:52:00.576 --> 00:52:03.704 align:middle line:84%
If you pass this test,
what does that tell you?

00:52:03.704 --> 00:52:06.498 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, it tells
me what I already knew.

00:52:06.498 --> 00:52:08.292 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
help you personally?

00:52:08.292 --> 00:52:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Does it reinforce to you
that what happened happened?

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.965 align:middle line:84%
Because I still think
there's a little part of you,

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:18.177 align:middle line:84%
a really small part
of you, that thinks,

00:52:18.177 --> 00:52:20.095 align:middle line:90%
did this really happen to me?

00:52:20.095 --> 00:52:23.182 align:middle line:84%
Or is my mind playing
games with me?

00:52:23.182 --> 00:52:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think having those
test results will help me.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.607 align:middle line:84%
But I think more
importantly, it'll

00:52:31.607 --> 00:52:33.609 align:middle line:84%
help some of the
other people out there

00:52:33.609 --> 00:52:36.945 align:middle line:84%
that say, OK, this guy's
just talking nonsense.

00:52:36.945 --> 00:52:39.198 align:middle line:84%
Because I know what
I've experienced.

00:52:39.198 --> 00:52:41.241 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
convinced it happened to you.

00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:42.618 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I am
absolutely convinced.

00:52:42.618 --> 00:52:45.621 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is not a figment
of your vivid imagination.

00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:46.455 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:52:46.455 --> 00:52:49.958 align:middle line:84%
Having gone through the
memory recalls that I have--

00:52:49.958 --> 00:52:52.586 align:middle line:84%
and again, over a
20-year period--

00:52:52.586 --> 00:52:58.133 align:middle line:84%
the different dots that occurred
and making the connections

00:52:58.133 --> 00:53:02.805 align:middle line:84%
with those, even going
back to my childhood, to me

00:53:02.805 --> 00:53:06.934 align:middle line:84%
is enough information for me to
reach that kind of conclusion.

00:53:06.934 --> 00:53:09.144 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why didn't you
come forward 10 years ago?

00:53:09.144 --> 00:53:10.312 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I wasn't convinced.

00:53:10.312 --> 00:53:12.314 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't ready.

00:53:12.314 --> 00:53:13.357 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're ready now?

00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:14.483 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I am.

00:53:14.483 --> 00:53:15.984 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Full speed ahead?

00:53:15.984 --> 00:53:17.277 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Full speed ahead.

00:53:17.277 --> 00:53:18.278 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ramifications?

00:53:18.278 --> 00:53:19.613 align:middle line:90%
You don't care?

00:53:19.613 --> 00:53:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I do care,
because I have family

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:23.867 align:middle line:90%
and because I care about them.

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:30.833 align:middle line:84%
As far as me personally,
having gone about as low as one

00:53:30.833 --> 00:53:33.377 align:middle line:84%
I believe can be in
my life and having

00:53:33.377 --> 00:53:35.712 align:middle line:90%
been at the very bottom--

00:53:35.712 --> 00:53:40.843 align:middle line:84%
And there are always
possibilities of ramifications.

00:53:40.843 --> 00:53:43.345 align:middle line:84%
There are people all
throughout history

00:53:43.345 --> 00:53:45.931 align:middle line:84%
that have, for instance,
brought out new technologies.

00:53:45.931 --> 00:53:49.184 align:middle line:84%
And they get mired in
false civil charges

00:53:49.184 --> 00:53:53.313 align:middle line:84%
and locked up on false
charges for this or that.

00:53:53.313 --> 00:53:54.815 align:middle line:84%
And you never hear
from them again.

00:53:54.815 --> 00:53:56.817 align:middle line:84%
Are there ways that they
could shut things down?

00:53:56.817 --> 00:53:57.609 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:53:57.609 --> 00:53:59.194 align:middle line:90%
Of course there are.

00:53:59.194 --> 00:54:01.697 align:middle line:84%
But the information's
important enough

00:54:01.697 --> 00:54:04.658 align:middle line:84%
and I feel strongly
enough about it

00:54:04.658 --> 00:54:06.577 align:middle line:84%
that I'm willing
to take that risk.

00:54:06.577 --> 00:54:08.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does your
family say about this?

00:54:08.495 --> 00:54:10.539 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They're supportive.

00:54:10.539 --> 00:54:11.957 align:middle line:90%
They're supportive of me.

00:54:11.957 --> 00:54:15.043 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
convinced that it happened?

00:54:15.043 --> 00:54:18.589 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They are convinced
that I'm convinced.

00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:20.549 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't know
what happened to you.

00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:22.718 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
happened to you.

00:54:22.718 --> 00:54:27.639 align:middle line:84%
But I actually believe you
believe what happened to you.

00:54:27.639 --> 00:54:29.725 align:middle line:84%
And that tells me
everything I need to know.

00:54:29.725 --> 00:54:30.726 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:54:30.726 --> 00:54:31.518 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:54:31.518 --> 00:54:35.856 align:middle line:84%
And being able to,
if nothing else,

00:54:35.856 --> 00:54:38.901 align:middle line:84%
open people's minds
to the possibilities--

00:54:38.901 --> 00:54:41.695 align:middle line:84%
and I think a lot of the
changes that we're seeing here

00:54:41.695 --> 00:54:44.406 align:middle line:84%
in the US with people
awakening to what's

00:54:44.406 --> 00:54:47.576 align:middle line:84%
going on behind the scenes
with our own government

00:54:47.576 --> 00:54:49.453 align:middle line:84%
and the shadow
government, that's

00:54:49.453 --> 00:54:51.121 align:middle line:90%
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:53.665 align:middle line:84%
And being able to open
people's eyes to that--

00:54:53.665 --> 00:54:58.420 align:middle line:84%
if we can reach one person
and help them put context

00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.755 align:middle line:84%
to some of these
strange memories

00:54:59.755 --> 00:55:03.383 align:middle line:84%
that they're having, to show
them, hey, you're not crazy,

00:55:03.383 --> 00:55:05.677 align:middle line:84%
you're not just
imagining these things,

00:55:05.677 --> 00:55:07.971 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
possibility of some more

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:10.849 align:middle line:84%
information out there,
of more experiences

00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:13.769 align:middle line:84%
out there than you
ever even considered,

00:55:13.769 --> 00:55:15.395 align:middle line:90%
then I consider it a success.

00:55:15.395 --> 00:55:17.564 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief," Jason.

00:55:17.564 --> 00:55:17.648 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Thank you for having me.

00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:18.774 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And good luck to you.

00:55:18.774 --> 00:55:19.775 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Appreciate that.

00:55:19.775 --> 00:55:22.236 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe?

00:55:22.236 --> 00:55:24.029 align:middle line:90%
Really doesn't matter, does it?

00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Because it's an
incredible story that

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.951 align:middle line:84%
has some very real
possibilities.

00:55:28.951 --> 00:55:31.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.081 align:middle line:90%
