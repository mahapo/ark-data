>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.420 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.774 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:20.440 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.840 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NARRATOR: And now the host
of the nationally syndicated

"Coast to Coast AM" and Gaiam
TV bring you "Beyond Belief"

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.211 align:middle line:90%
Glad to have you with us.

00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:10%
You know, government is
committing $100 billion

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.440 align:middle line:10%
to study the brain.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.490 align:middle line:10%
And our guest tonight
on "Beyond Belief"

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.770 align:middle line:10%
has made a career
studying the brain.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Best selling author, "Tickle
Your Amygdala" Neil Slade.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.992 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Neil,
welcome to the show.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.400 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is an amygdala?

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NEIL SLADE: Amygdala, well
it's the master click switch

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:84%
within your brain, is
what I like to call it.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a hub of your own emotions.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the part that's connected
to both the most primitive part

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:84%
of your brain and the most
advanced part of your brain

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.820 align:middle line:84%
to give you feedback of
which way you should go

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.040 align:middle line:90%
and which we should avoid.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where is
it in the brain?

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, I've got an
actual photograph of the human

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
brain, and this is a
hemisphere of the brain,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:84%
one half of the brain,
the left hemisphere.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it's highlighted
a little bit in red there.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.695 align:middle line:84%
And in real life it's about the
size of the tip of your thumb.

00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Very small.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yeah.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's situated right, this
is the most primitive part

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.520 align:middle line:84%
of your brain, which is
called the R-complex,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.329 align:middle line:84%
or what Dr Paul MacLean
called the reptile portion

00:01:59.329 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:90%
of our brain.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.134 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: And then, this is the
most advanced part of the human

00:02:03.134 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:90%
brain.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Evolutionarily, the
most advanced part

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:90%
called the frontal lobes.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And the amygdala is kind of
situated right in between.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And you have one for each
hemisphere of your brain.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And I have a life-size
model of the brain,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.234 align:middle line:84%
so that people know exactly
what we're talking about.

00:02:20.234 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, it
was interesting, too.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.275 align:middle line:84%
As you were showing us the
picture of where the reptilian

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
brain was, it's almost as
if as the brain was forming

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:84%
in reptiles probably first,
it came first, right?

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And then this massive
amount of brain

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:84%
that we humans possess kind
of evolved later around it.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Is that a pretty
good perception?

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Yes, it functions
like the brain of snakes

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and reptiles, in that it
controls the more rudimentary

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:84%
type of processes in our
body and in our brain.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
It controls when we go to
sleep, when we wake up,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:84%
it processes heart rate,
temperature, the fight

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.710 align:middle line:84%
or flight response to allow
us to run from danger.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: So very rudimentary
types of processes.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And as time went on,
as animals evolved,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:84%
it became advantageous to
have these other functions

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:90%
of the brain added on.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So when we got to the
stage of human development,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:84%
we've got all of
this area here, which

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:84%
is called the primate
brain, and you've

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:84%
got another part called the
mammal brain surrounding it.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So exactly as you
described there.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What a great
machine, isn't it?

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, you know, people
like Carl Sagan and Richard

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:90%
Restak have calculated.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a mathematician,
I'm not exactly sure

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:90%
how they calculated this.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you add up all of
the possible connections

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:84%
in the human brain,
it's more than

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.160 align:middle line:84%
the number of stars in
the visible universe.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%
It's more than all
of the grains of sand

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:90%
added together on earth.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's an astronomical number
of connections possible.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And your brain is an
infinity machine, really.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:90%
It calculates.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what the
brain is capable of.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.144 align:middle line:90%
That potential is so great.

00:04:15.144 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Neil, there seems
to be an argument between pure

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:84%
science and people who
practice metaphysics.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.159 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, they
can't seem to join.

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I think there should
be a connection there,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
but the pure sciences will
say, without the brain

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:90%
everything ceases.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Where the person who studies
the supernatural or metaphysics

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:90%
would say, no, no, no.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness exists
beyond the physical brain.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
You don't need the
brain for consciousness.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:90%
It exists outside of the brain.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Who's right?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: I tend to agree with
people who say consciousness

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
exists within the brain, but
also outside of the brain.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And we know this from actual
laboratory experiments

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
that point to paranormal types
of phenomenon and sensitivity

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:90%
within the human brain.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting
anecdotal references.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:84%
One comes to mind, Rupert
Sheldrake, who is a researcher,

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
talks about a woman who,
during surgery, left her body

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:84%
while she was experiencing
a near-death experience.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
She had died on the operating
table and was resuscitated.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But while she was
out of her body,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:84%
she saw a red sneaker on
the roof of the hospital.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So after she related this story,
after she was revived and came

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
back, they went up on
the roof with a witness,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:90%
so it wasn't just one person.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:84%
They went up and
they found the shoe

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that she described having
seen while she was--

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Her body
just floated out.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Exactly.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:84%
The woman would having
no conscious way

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
of knowing that there
would be a red sneaker

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:90%
on the roof the building.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But there's many
thousands of cases

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:84%
of these type of
anecdotal experiences

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:84%
that point to consciousness
outside of the brain.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
But also, there's many,
many laboratory experiments

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and research that
shows the existence

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.280 align:middle line:90%
of paranormal phenomenon.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.821 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
people get into that.

00:06:23.821 --> 00:06:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: I actually compiled a
list for those skeptics who say

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.892 align:middle line:84%
paranormal phenomenon is
just someone's imagination.

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A list?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.535 align:middle line:90%
That's like a scroll.

00:06:33.535 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, this
is, what I did is,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.107 align:middle line:84%
with the help of a
Torbjorn Sassersson--

00:06:38.107 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let me
hold it out with you.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, he compiled
this list of laboratory--

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Jeez.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.779 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: These are double blind
experiments and laboratory--

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All
paranormal experiences.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: These are all
paranormal laboratory

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And so, the idea that
this is just something

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.019 align:middle line:90%
that someone is making up is--

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's backed up.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Its backed up
by scientific evidence.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:90%
And so we'll--

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have fun
rolling it back up.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Yeah, we'll just kind
of leave this here as Christmas

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:90%
decorations.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We've
talked about this.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
The story for example,
again, a near-death

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.200 align:middle line:84%
experience in a hospital,
where the person leaves

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the body and witnesses the
attending physician flirting

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:90%
with the nurse.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:90%
And comes back into his body.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor says, oh my
gosh, we almost lost you.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And the guy said, yeah,
you almost lost me

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.222 align:middle line:84%
because you weren't
paying attention to me.

00:07:32.222 --> 00:07:33.721 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
what do you mean?

00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, you were flirting with
the nurse while I was dying.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.506 align:middle line:90%
And it was true.

00:07:37.506 --> 00:07:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Truly amazing.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.491 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, this, again,
this is a life-size model

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:90%
of the human brain.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.110 align:middle line:90%
And we can take it apart.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And we can examine different
aspects of the brain.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done is color
coded, because in my work

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
I concentrate on two
areas of the brain,

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:84%
so that people
know what they need

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.189 align:middle line:84%
to do to activate, if they
wish, paranormal sensitivity.

00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Or just, they want
to increase their creativity,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.285 align:middle line:84%
or if they want to tap into
more positive emotions.

00:08:09.285 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And a brain is
this size, a normal brain?

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yeah.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.383 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Life-size?

00:08:12.383 --> 00:08:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: You can hold
that and play with that.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Seems a
little small, isn't it?

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Must be my producer's.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: The human brain
weighs about three pounds.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's of, of course,
this is hard plastic.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's more like
the consistency

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.050 align:middle line:84%
of tofu, a firm
tofu, for example.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:10%
>> SLADE: So what I've done here
is hooked up a couple lights

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:10%
to illustrate how
the amygdala works.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I consider that the
master click switch, the hub.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So the amygdala is actually
located inside each hemisphere.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Right in about this position.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Now people, if any
person wants to find

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.590 align:middle line:84%
where their own
amygdala is, there's

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.870 align:middle line:90%
a very simple way to do it.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.940 align:middle line:84%
You put your thumbs in
your ears, like this.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Thumbs in your ears.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: And then you take
your nasty gesture middle finger

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and you place it on the back
corner of your eye, right?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like this?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Right.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.998 align:middle line:90%
So you're holding your skull.

00:09:06.998 --> 00:09:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And then drape your finger
on the side of your temple,

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and then point right in
between these two fingers.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you go about one
inch inside each temple,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.876 align:middle line:84%
that's where your
amygdala switch would be.

00:09:19.876 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:90%
And that would be in there.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So the amygdala is a
very interesting switch,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.150 align:middle line:90%
in that it is an automatic.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a more primitive
part of the brain.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:84%
It's in what's called a mammal
portion of the human brain.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And when the amygdala
is clicked backwards,

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:44.990 align:middle line:84%
to cause an increase in fight
or flight-- for example,

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I brought this little
creature, here.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A tense situation.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.643 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yes.

00:09:48.643 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:84%
You may be walking
down the street

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and you may see a
rattlesnake in your path.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as
you perceive this,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:84%
the amygdala will
click backwards,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and it will send additional
chemical, electrical activity

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.700 align:middle line:84%
to activate the fight
or flight response.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:90%
And its instantaneous.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to--

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You don't even
have to act, it happens.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: The amygdala just
automatically perceives

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:90%
the threat.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.493 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's like pulling out
of the way of an oncoming car.

00:10:17.493 --> 00:10:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Something kicks in, and you just
know by instinct what to do.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: It's
genetically programmed.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Or you may have learned
by putting your finger

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.750 align:middle line:84%
on a hot stove when you
were six years old, right?

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.934 align:middle line:84%
Or not to put your finger
inside a rattlesnake cage.

00:10:32.934 --> 00:10:34.975 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This is not a
real stuffed rattlesnake?

00:10:34.975 --> 00:10:35.847 align:middle line:90%
This is rubber?

00:10:35.847 --> 00:10:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yes.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, thank God.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: So this is a nonlethal
version of the rattlesnake.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.609 align:middle line:90%
Or you may hear the rattle.

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.775 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: If you're
familiar with that.

00:10:44.775 --> 00:10:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So the amygdala receives
inputs from all different parts

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, from optical,
from hearing, from smell, even

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:90%
from taste.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
But it automatically and very
quickly will perceive a threat.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.569 align:middle line:84%
And then activates the
fight or flight response.

00:11:00.569 --> 00:11:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just like that.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.693 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: And you can
either fight off your enemy,

00:11:03.693 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:90%
or run quickly and get away.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
conventional view

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that the amygdala
is your fear button.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, what scientists
have learned

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:84%
is that the amygdala, that's
only half of the picture.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:84%
The other half of
the picture is when

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
it sees something that
enhances your survival, right?

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.119 align:middle line:84%
Or that enhances
your quality of life.

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A little puppy.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: So we have a little
furry, right, with a smile.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So when your brain perceives
something like that,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.351 align:middle line:84%
it automatically computes
reward, and turns on pleasure.

00:11:39.351 --> 00:11:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or love, or
something like that.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Exactly.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you
were a little kid

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.850 align:middle line:84%
your mom smiled and then
rocked you and you felt good.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So you learn to associate
smile with feeling good.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you
see a person smile,

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
your amygdala automatically
and instantly clicks forward.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And then turns on the frontal
lobes part of the brain.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you say
clicks forward, literally?

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Is there like a little
click flap there?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, it's
very remarkable,

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:84%
because when people learn to
self-stimulate their amygdala--

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can do that, you can
learn to actually purposefully

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:84%
turn on the more advanced
parts of your brain,

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and control your positive
emotions until you--

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know what
your amygdala does,

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:84%
you're pretty much stuck
with your amygdala responding

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:90%
to external circumstances.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.230 align:middle line:84%
You stumble upon a
rattlesnake, or you

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.510 align:middle line:90%
stumble upon a furry puppy dog.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it just clicks
backward and forward, just

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:84%
depending upon
what you run into.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Can the amygdala suffer?

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.487 align:middle line:84%
Can it get damaged,
where it affects you?

00:12:50.487 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yes.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons we
know what the amygdala does

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
is by observing people
who've had damaged amygdala

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.170 align:middle line:84%
or have been born with
a defective amygdala.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we see the change
in the corresponding types

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.640 align:middle line:90%
of brain behavior.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Now this is kind of like a very
rudimentary beginning amygdala

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.490 align:middle line:90%
lesson.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:12.854 align:middle line:90%
Click forward, feel good.

00:13:12.854 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I like that.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Click backward.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take a few quick
questions from the audience

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:90%
for you, Neil, while we chat.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:84%
[IMITATING PUPPY VOICE]
All right,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:84%
anybody have any
question for Neil?

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.240 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Somebody, yes, you.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I always wanted to be a
ventriloquist, always.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:90%
How did I do?

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: So in regard
to that, as you were saying,

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.541 align:middle line:84%
it could be damaged or
you could be traumatized,

00:13:35.541 --> 00:13:36.540 align:middle line:90%
could you describe that?

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Do stay in that place?

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Or do you come back
out of that place?

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, there have been
instances where surgery has

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:84%
been purposefully used for
someone who has chronic fear

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.330 align:middle line:90%
or anxiety.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Very extreme cases, where no
other solution has been found.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, they have
electrically, for example, made

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
some purposefully caused
damage to the amygdala

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:84%
so it wouldn't click
into that fear response.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But what they found
is that, there

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:84%
are other methods, such
as pharmaceuticals.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
behavior modification

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:84%
that you can use that's very
successful in alleviating

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:21.320 align:middle line:84%
deficiencies in
amygdala function.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
What is interesting
about the amygdala,

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:84%
when you start to
study it, is that you

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
realize it's just not
an on or off switch.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.410 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a
rheostat, that it's

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
got an infinite
number of positions

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
forward into
pleasure or backwards

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:90%
into anxiety and fear.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And for that, I made this
more advanced amygdala model.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So again, the
amygdala is situated

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the brain.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And there we have
a red light, which

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:84%
is representative of that
primitive part of the brain.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
a rage, road rage,

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps when you're
doing your income taxes

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.569 align:middle line:90%
and you're very, very angry.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Stressed.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.026 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Right.

00:15:05.026 --> 00:15:08.149 align:middle line:84%
This part of the brain
is cranked up very high.

00:15:08.149 --> 00:15:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: And what you feel
is negative emotion and fear.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Now that's offset by the frontal
lobes, the more advanced part

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:90%
of your brain.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.330 align:middle line:90%
And we'll turn that on here.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Now you can see that it's
on, but it's very dim.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And most of us, we have
enough frontal lobes activity

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:84%
that we can plan what we're
going to have for lunch,

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, or we're going to
decide what TV show we're

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.270 align:middle line:90%
going to watch for the day.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or what radio
show to listen to.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Or what radio
show, yes, of course.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.390 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Now the trick here
is, you want to turn

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.530 align:middle line:84%
on more of your advanced
part of your brain.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And the amygdala can
send more of that energy

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:90%
forward into the frontal lobes.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And since the reptile brain
computes negative emotion,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and the frontal lobes is
connected to positive emotion,

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.400 align:middle line:84%
as you allow the
amygdala to send

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.660 align:middle line:84%
more activity to
the frontal lobes,

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that the whole nature
of the internal experience

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:84%
changes, to where
there's a balance,

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and that what you're
feeling is more pleasure.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.116 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:16:13.116 --> 00:16:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: And you can't feel
pain and pleasure at the same

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:90%
It's typically one of the other.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So as you turn on the
pleasurable part of your brain,

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:84%
it then turns down the
pain and so on in the back.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So it should
be either/or, generally?

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: It is.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Generally, you're going to be
feeling one more predominantly

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:90%
than the other.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of
brain self-control,

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:84%
of knowing what the amygdala
does and how to stimulate it,

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:84%
is you can cause more of
that frontal lobes behavior

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.160 align:middle line:90%
and processes to occur.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And that turns on all of
these very interesting

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:55.530 align:middle line:84%
paranormal sensitivities and
reception and those brain

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:90%
magical types of things.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: OK, we'll
get into that,

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:84%
because I want to find out
where you think, in the brain,

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:01.506 align:middle line:84%
these paranormal
activities occur.

00:17:01.506 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
How about some more
questions for Neil Slade?

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: OK, so you're
saying that when the frontal

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:84%
part of your brain, which
is the more advanced part

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
of your brain is on,
most of the time,

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:84%
a lot of time it's in response
to love and compassion

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:90%
and those good feelings.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:23.079 align:middle line:84%
So would you say that the
evolution of the brain

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
maybe came from love and
compassion and those sorts

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:90%
of things?

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, we develop these
additional layers of the brain,

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
because it enhanced
our survival.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
In the end, that's what's
really most important to Mother

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Nature, is that the individual
and the species survive.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So it was in our own best
interest, as a species,

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.690 align:middle line:84%
that we develop these
additional capacities that

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.910 align:middle line:90%
included positive emotion.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
The reptiles have
been on the planet

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.890 align:middle line:90%
for much longer than mammals.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But the ability to engage in
positive emotions, as well

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
as negative
emotions, and then be

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:84%
able to compute very high levels
of cooperation and planning

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and logic and even higher
levels of intuition,

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.820 align:middle line:84%
that's why we have these
additional capacities

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.260 align:middle line:90%
and functions of the brain.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it made it possible
to survive in situations where

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian types of brain
functions were just not enough.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.230 align:middle line:84%
When the dinosaurs disappeared,
the small furry mammals

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:84%
continued to survive,
even through what

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:47.430 align:middle line:84%
was perceived as the Ice
Ages and the big changes

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.224 align:middle line:84%
that Earth went through that
many millions of years ago.

00:18:51.224 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Great.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
How about another
question for Niel?

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.516 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:18:55.516 --> 00:18:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: As
a game developer,

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested in now
people assess risk versus

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:90%
reward.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very curious
and how you are

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:84%
able to measure these
things in the brain.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
What kind of tools or
processes do you use?

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: There have been
some researchers who have gone

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:84%
into that specific area, in
terms of what makes people take

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:90%
risks?

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:26.255 align:middle line:84%
What makes people go
for a positive reward?

00:19:26.255 --> 00:19:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Uh-huh, more
aggressive than others.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yes.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
The most interesting
thing that I know about,

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
is that the function
of the brain

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:84%
is much better, whether
you're problem solving

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.040 align:middle line:84%
or, in your case,
would be doing a game.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:84%
When you are clicked backwards
into this fight or flight

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:84%
response, it turns-- it reduces
the capacity of your brain

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:90%
to solve problems.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you're playing
a game, for example,

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:03.020 align:middle line:84%
if you're tense, if you're
feeling especially competitive,

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.540 align:middle line:84%
it's going to reduce
your ability to perform.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.510 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if
you're feeling relaxed,

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:84%
if you're feeling
cooperative, if you're

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:84%
feeling these emotions
of love and friendship,

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
that increases your ability
for problem solving,

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.950 align:middle line:84%
and for performance
in a situation where

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:90%
you might be playing a game.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So to be aware of whether your
amygdala is clicked forward

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
or backward is a
very important thing

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:84%
to consider when you're
doing problem solving,

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.872 align:middle line:84%
or in your case
involved in a game.

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There
was a neurosurgeon,

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
his name is Eben Alexander,
he's now a believer

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.720 align:middle line:84%
He was not prior
to his own episode.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:90%
He had meningitis.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.540 align:middle line:84%
He was in a coma
for a long time.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And in that state,
he's now convinced

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
that he went to the other
side and he saw that.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Came back with a totally
different view of the brain

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and its perception-- and
this is a neurosurgeon.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:12.190 align:middle line:84%
In terms of, then, the
paranormal tie-in to the brain,

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
where in the brain is
it emanating from, Neil,

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.650 align:middle line:90%
if at all?

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, that's a
very interesting question,

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:84%
because we know that humans,
it's been documented as we see

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:84%
here, experience telepathy,
experience precognition,

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:90%
all types of things.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And what you can do is
make an educated guess

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:84%
as to what types of
processes enhance or elicit

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:84%
these types of
paranormal experience.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And what types of
processes inhibit.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
the brain, in general,

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.320 align:middle line:84%
you find that there
is a correlation

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:84%
between those negative
reptilian types of responses.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And that you have very
little paranormal experience

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.864 align:middle line:84%
when you're clicked back into
that fight or flight fear.

00:22:05.864 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, when you're

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:13.000 align:middle line:84%
clicked forward into frontal
lobes activities and processes,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.415 align:middle line:84%
that helps to promote
these types of experiences.

00:22:16.415 --> 00:22:17.874 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It
energizes it, somehow.

00:22:17.874 --> 00:22:18.498 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yeah.

00:22:18.498 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Now the way I've
looked at it is that we

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:84%
have five normal senses
that everyone recognizes.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.612 align:middle line:84%
But we also five
paranormal senses, as well.

00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That we always had?

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: That we always had.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the normal
five senses are

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:84%
easy to remember if you
think of the human head.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:90%
You have sight.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.780 align:middle line:90%
You have smell.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:90%
You have taste.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:90%
You have hearing.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:90%
And then you have touch.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Those are the five normal
senses that everyone relates to.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.190 align:middle line:84%
But you also have five
paranormal senses.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of
paranormal experience,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:84%
they will all fit somewhere
in these categories.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So telepathy, knowing
what someone else

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.850 align:middle line:90%
is thinking or feeling.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Precognition is
the ability to know

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:84%
what's going to
happen in the future,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.514 align:middle line:90%
without having any sensory data.

00:23:11.514 --> 00:23:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even a minute
ahead of time.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Maybe a minute
ahead of time, maybe an hour,

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.480 align:middle line:90%
maybe five years.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:84%
You have clairvoyance, which is
the sense of seeing something

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.570 align:middle line:84%
in your brain,
perceiving a visual idea,

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.830 align:middle line:84%
but having no
sensory optical data.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:90%
That's clairvoyance.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Then you have
clairaudience, which

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:84%
is the perception of some
sort of auditory signal,

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:84%
but there's no sensory
data giving you

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:90%
that auditory signal.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
we have telekinesis,

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.859 align:middle line:84%
which is related to touch, and
the ability of objects to move.

00:23:51.859 --> 00:23:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: With your mind.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:58.004 align:middle line:10%
>> SLADE: Or that move without
any deliberate manipulation.

00:23:58.004 --> 00:24:00.003 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Like Uri Geller
and his spoon bending,

00:24:00.003 --> 00:24:00.877 align:middle line:10%
and things like that.

00:24:00.877 --> 00:24:02.985 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Yeah,
spoon bending is one.

00:24:02.985 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm wearing a
watch, for example, here.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:11.600 align:middle line:84%
This watch moved from
one location to another

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.725 align:middle line:84%
without any explanation
that I could come up.

00:24:15.725 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You mean, it
changed times for you?

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Well, it teleported.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.964 align:middle line:84%
And this is hard, I'm a
very skeptical person.

00:24:20.964 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now what do
you mean, it teleported?

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, I used
to teach music lessons.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I taught music
lessons for 30 years.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And I would go to each
one of my lessons,

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:30.934 align:middle line:90%
and I would put on my watch.

00:24:30.934 --> 00:24:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
go to the lesson.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And during the lesson I
would keep looking, OK, we've

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.080 align:middle line:84%
got another 10 minutes,
another five, right?

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
This is how I would
keep track of the time.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So one day, I was late
for my music lesson.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I left my house in
a hurry, locked the door.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm on my front
steps my neighbor

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.560 align:middle line:84%
is coming down his steps at the
same time and says, hey, Neil.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what time it is?

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.907 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled back my sleeve to
see what time it was, except--

00:24:58.907 --> 00:24:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's gone.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: My, oh,
I forgot my watch.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:90%
I left it on my desk.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.899 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I don't know
what time it is,

00:25:03.899 --> 00:25:05.560 align:middle line:84%
but I gotta run
because I'm late.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So I got in my car and I
drove to my music lesson.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And then forgot about the watch.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a creature of
habit, like everyone else.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So about halfway through
the music lesson,

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking oh, OK, let's
see how much time there is.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled back my sleeve,
and my watch was on my wrist.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No?

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:90%
It was back.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: And then I realized,
it wasn't on my wrist when I

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:90%
left the house.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that for
a fact, because I

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
had looked and had
missed the watch.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't go back to get
it because I was so late.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:84%
So the watch had moved from
my desktop to my wrist.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.270 align:middle line:90%
That's related to telekinesis.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you
will it to happen?

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:46.478 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: No, no.

00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:49.780 align:middle line:84%
This is what's-- you know,
there's two kinds of paranormal

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:84%
One I call DESP, which is
Deliberate Extrasensory,

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
you're deliberately

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.351 align:middle line:84%
trying to predict
the lotto numbers.

00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:90%
You know, or to move a pencil.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And it never works.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.698 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Hey, you know what?

00:26:04.698 --> 00:26:06.680 align:middle line:90%
It's very rare that it works.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:84%
There are some instances where
I've noticed that it does work,

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.140 align:middle line:84%
but there's very
special circumstances

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:90%
where you can make it work.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
are extraordinary people

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.310 align:middle line:90%
who have a talent for that.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Like you mentioned Uri Geller,
and there are notable psychics

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:27.034 align:middle line:84%
that, in a laboratory,
can make this DESP work.

00:26:27.034 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.005 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: But for most of
us, it's a matter of SESP.

00:26:31.005 --> 00:26:34.480 align:middle line:90%
And I call it Spontaneous ESP.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.490 align:middle line:84%
It happens when we have a need,
when our normal senses weren't

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:41.457 align:middle line:90%
quite enough.

00:26:41.457 --> 00:26:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Unplanned.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: For me, to remember
to put my watch on my wrist that

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:90%
day wasn't enough.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.230 align:middle line:90%
But I needed to have my watch.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And for a reason
I can't explain,

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.994 align:middle line:84%
the watch moved from
my desktop to my wrist.

00:26:53.994 --> 00:26:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you're convinced
you left without the watch.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:57.951 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Oh, I'm
absolutely certain.

00:26:57.951 --> 00:27:00.489 align:middle line:84%
I have no reason to make
that kind of thing up,

00:27:00.489 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:90%
or to even wish it to happened.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.446 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:27:02.446 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Another personal
experience for me--

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and I don't like to talk about
personal experiences too much.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:11.930 align:middle line:84%
The real important stuff
is done by scientists

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:15.430 align:middle line:84%
who are dedicated to proving
the paranormal phenomenon.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:90%
We have a broom in our house.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And I had bought this
broom, it was during Harry

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Potter's-- the last
Harry Potter book.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: One of
those kind of brooms.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:10%
>> SLADE: Yeah,
and I was writing,

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:10%
I started writing a book
called "The Book of Wands."

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Yes, you have.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:10%
>> SLADE: Which is about
paranormal tools that you can

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:37.500 align:middle line:10%
use to help accentuate
the paranormal experience

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.630 align:middle line:10%
in the brain.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.420 align:middle line:10%
So I bought several of
these decorative brooms.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.340 align:middle line:90%
And I hung them on my wall.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And they were wedged
on the wall quite well.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, on five
different occasions,

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:84%
this broom has
flown off the wall

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.790 align:middle line:84%
into the middle of
the living room.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's wedged very
tightly on the hook.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:00.340 align:middle line:90%
It's happened two times--

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, have
you seen it move?

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.956 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: It's
happened two times,

00:28:02.956 --> 00:28:07.400 align:middle line:84%
once when my wife was in
the room on the couch.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And once when I
was on the couch.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Another third time when
we were in the room.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.926 align:middle line:84%
The first two times
it happened, it

00:28:13.926 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:84%
woke us up in the
middle of the night,

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.160 align:middle line:90%
because it made this loud bang!

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Bang, yeah.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Kind of related
to the clairaudience.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.070 align:middle line:84%
An audible sound that had
no reasonable sensory,

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:90%
we perceived a noise.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk
about telekinesis,

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.450 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about that
ability to purposefully bend

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:39.220 align:middle line:84%
a spoon, as people
might do, but also

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:84%
about objects moving around
with no reasonable explanation.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And something that you've got to
kind of figure out for yourself

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.030 align:middle line:90%
why that's happening.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.279 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sometimes, though,
you have to wonder, Neil,

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:84%
if you're manifesting
it yourself,

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.297 align:middle line:84%
or if these
experiences just occur.

00:28:56.297 --> 00:28:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: That's a very
interesting question

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:02.450 align:middle line:84%
because, in the
instance of the broom,

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:84%
this happened before
I got married.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I married a
woman named Julia Lu.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:13.285 align:middle line:84%
And she had actually met
me through your show,

00:29:13.285 --> 00:29:14.410 align:middle line:90%
because she was happening--

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: There you go.

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: You might start a
dating service part of, you

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:23.950 align:middle line:84%
know, sign up for our-- but
she was having a number--

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:90%
she had a degree in science.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.889 align:middle line:84%
She had her PhD in science
from the University of Indiana.

00:29:29.889 --> 00:29:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: But she was having
all of these paranormal

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:34.370 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.069 align:middle line:84%
She was having verified
out of body experiences.

00:29:37.069 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And couldn't
figure it out,

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.940 align:middle line:84%
because science couldn't
tell her what was happening.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: And so she just-- but
she's the type of person that

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.210 align:middle line:90%
doesn't filter information.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.640 align:middle line:90%
She's a kid at heart.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.570 align:middle line:90%
She says what's on her mind.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:53.200 align:middle line:84%
She has removed those
filters that most of us

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.030 align:middle line:84%
have culturally learned
to say, well this-- it's

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.100 align:middle line:84%
not possible for
your watch to move.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not possible for you to
read another person's mind.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.910 align:middle line:84%
But she doesn't have
any of these filters.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So the second time she came
to visit me in Colorado,

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.810 align:middle line:90%
because she lived in Missouri.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.910 align:middle line:84%
The second time she came,
that's when, in her presence,

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.760 align:middle line:84%
the broom started
flying off the wall.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
related to, you know,

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:25.607 align:middle line:84%
we know in quantum physics
that the observer affects

00:30:25.607 --> 00:30:26.565 align:middle line:90%
what they're observing.

00:30:26.565 --> 00:30:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No question.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Right?

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So here's a woman who
is not filtering out

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.090 align:middle line:84%
the idea that brooms
can't fly or that watches

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:90%
can't move and telepathy.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And she came into the
house and suddenly she's

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.850 align:middle line:84%
affecting her
immediate environment.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.234 align:middle line:84%
And then the broom starts
flying off the wall.

00:30:44.234 --> 00:30:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Isn't that
amazing how that happens?

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.880 align:middle line:10%
Hey, Neil, what its
paranormal brain preceptor.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880 align:middle line:10%
What is that?

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.670 align:middle line:10%
>> SLADE: Paranormal
brain preceptor?

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think what
you're talking about

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:59.900 align:middle line:84%
is, what are those
processes in the brain that

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.070 align:middle line:84%
are related to these
paranormal types of things.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Experiences.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:03.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: So what I found was
that each one of the paranormal

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:12.450 align:middle line:84%
experiences relates to a
normal experience and process

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's actual
locations that we

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:19.280 align:middle line:84%
can point to in the human
brain that are related.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.510 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we take
the concept of telepathy,

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:84%
again, knowing what
another person is thinking,

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:84%
or more importantly, what
another person is feeling.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:39.630 align:middle line:84%
In the human brain the ability
to perceive outside the self

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:42.140 align:middle line:90%
is a frontal lobes process.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.880 align:middle line:84%
That's, the frontal
lobes being everything

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that's in front of
this red strip here,

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:90%
the motor strip in the brain.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So in the human brain,
there's a portion

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.840 align:middle line:90%
called it premedial cortex.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's important.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's a key part of the
brain that processes empathy.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So that when you
do something, you

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.062 align:middle line:84%
consider what that effect
would have one another person.

00:32:09.062 --> 00:32:10.395 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And the ramifications.

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: The ramifications of
your actions on another person.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Now there was a very
interesting study

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that was done recently
on prison inmates.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And they did brain scans
of two types of prisoners.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:30.895 align:middle line:84%
One that the prisoner
was a psychopathic--

00:32:30.895 --> 00:32:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Violent offender.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: --criminal.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Violent offender that had no
remorse, that did something

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:84%
without caring at all
what the effect was.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Had no remorse.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Could care less.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Could care less.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.140 align:middle line:84%
The other type of
criminal may have

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:84%
been convicted of a violent
crime or other type of crime,

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:84%
but they then experienced
those feelings,

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, I really
shouldn't have done that

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:57.450 align:middle line:90%
and I'm sorry for doing that.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Or I hurt somebody.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, something like that.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.816 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: They could put
themselves in someone

00:33:01.816 --> 00:33:02.390 align:middle line:90%
else's shoes.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:90%
So they did brain scans.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And what they realized, now--
I'll show you on this brain

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.010 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:84%
There's an area in
the frontal lobes

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:15.550 align:middle line:84%
on the inside of each of the
frontal lobes hemisphere called

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.450 align:middle line:90%
the pre medial cortex.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And what they found in the
psychopathic criminals,

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:84%
that portion was
not active or it

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:90%
have suffered damage or atrophy.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How would
it get damaged?

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.427 align:middle line:90%
How would it have any problems?

00:33:31.427 --> 00:33:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, it
could be a disease,

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.219 align:middle line:84%
or it could be damaged
through some type of accident.

00:33:35.219 --> 00:33:37.343 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, could they
have been born that way?

00:33:37.343 --> 00:33:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: They could have been
born with a deficiency in that

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.340 align:middle line:90%
part of their brain.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So we know that there's
a specific region

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:49.430 align:middle line:84%
in the brain that
helps you put yourself

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:50.880 align:middle line:90%
in the shoes of someone else.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.088 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It makes you human.

00:33:52.088 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: It makes you human.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So an extension of
that is telepathy.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:03.630 align:middle line:84%
This part of the brain responds
to sensory information.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:08.750 align:middle line:84%
You may see what the expression
is on a person's face.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.909 align:middle line:84%
When the frontal
lobes are damaged,

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:15.739 align:middle line:84%
you no longer have the ability
to decipher or interpret

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.440 align:middle line:90%
facial expressions.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:84%
If your frontal
lobes works properly,

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:23.300 align:middle line:84%
you see the smile
on someone's face,

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.614 align:middle line:90%
or your dog's wagging his tail.

00:34:24.614 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or the
gleam in the eye.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: That's right.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.989 align:middle line:90%
And so you can interpret it.

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But you need your
frontal lobes to do that.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Now an extension of
being able to interpret

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:37.800 align:middle line:84%
facial expressions, or
interpret sensory data that

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.310 align:middle line:84%
allows you to feel what
another person, telepathy

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:44.000 align:middle line:90%
doesn't depend on sensory data.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.150 align:middle line:84%
It can receive information
from another room,

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:53.350 align:middle line:84%
another floor, or even
10,000 miles away.

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: See that's why I'm
not sure you need the physical

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.700 align:middle line:90%
brain to accomplish that.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:84%
There's something
else out there, Neil.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.423 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, there is
something else out there.

00:35:03.423 --> 00:35:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, they found
through the laboratory

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.800 align:middle line:84%
experiments when they put
people in isolation booths

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and they see telepathy, one
thing that they discovered

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:20.490 align:middle line:84%
was that, if you don't have a
close connection to the person,

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.970 align:middle line:84%
if you don't feel in some
way bonded with that person,

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.250 align:middle line:84%
the telepathy
doesn't work as well,

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.190 align:middle line:90%
or it doesn't work at all.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And again it's the
frontal lobes that

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for these
high levels of cooperation

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and bonding that we
have with other people,

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:44.210 align:middle line:84%
or even in the cases of
animals, this interconnection,

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.990 align:middle line:84%
this high level of
cooperation makes

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:52.080 align:middle line:90%
possible telepathic sensitivity.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So again, without this
cooperative part of the brain,

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:58.820 align:middle line:90%
that shuts off the telepathy.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm going to do an
experiment on the brain with

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:02.680 align:middle line:90%
the audience.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is going
to be intriguing.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Now this is going to be
between one and five.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to flash you a number.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to flash
it yet, and when I do,

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I want you to just think
of that first number that

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.610 align:middle line:90%
came into your head.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Now statistically, 20% of the
audience will get this right.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I give out five numbers,
and I should theoretically

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.980 align:middle line:84%
get one out of five
somebody should get correct.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do is
I want you to close your eyes.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And when I say now, I want you
to grab the first number that

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:84%
comes into your head
between one and five.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I will tell
you the number I picked.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And let's see how
many people get that.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So clear your brains,
clear your minds,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
send it pretty soon.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.880 align:middle line:90%
The number was three.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Hold your hands up.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.755 align:middle line:90%
Who picked three?

00:36:56.755 --> 00:36:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Now what would you say
that statistically is?

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, I think
that's greater than 20%.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So what does that tell
you about the brain,

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:08.980 align:middle line:84%
or by this paranormal
experience?

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, the real trick
is looking at what would be

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.650 align:middle line:84%
random chance, and then
compare that with the results.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you
go beyond chance,

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:22.310 align:middle line:90%
that should tell you something.

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.893 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yes.

00:37:22.893 --> 00:37:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And to get beyond chance, it's
very difficult to do that.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So again, you have a
connection with your audience.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:35.306 align:middle line:84%
And that probably makes
that more of a possibility.

00:37:35.306 --> 00:37:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I was
also thinking four.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.500 align:middle line:84%
How many people
were thinking four.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:38.620 align:middle line:90%
See.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Four is the
number that came to me.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.915 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Four is my birth date,
and I thought of that first,

00:37:42.915 --> 00:37:44.860 align:middle line:90%
but I flashed the three.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.875 align:middle line:90%
I may have confused you.

00:37:46.875 --> 00:37:48.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's conceivable, huh?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.125 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Four is what I
got even before you picked

00:37:50.125 --> 00:37:51.800 align:middle line:90%
the number, and then, yes.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So you know, what
you can do is, look

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.690 align:middle line:84%
at cases in which the whole
frontal lobes, for example,

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:01.910 align:middle line:90%
may have been damaged.

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:04.810 align:middle line:84%
The famous case that
goes back to the 1800s

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.730 align:middle line:90%
is that of Phineas Gage.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's when, we, and I
say the scientific community,

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.500 align:middle line:84%
first began to understand
what the frontal lobes did.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And Phineas Gage was
a railroad worker.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he was
tamping down the explosive

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.350 align:middle line:84%
that helped them to set the
railroad ties into place.

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And as he's tamping down, the
charge accidentally went off.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And it drove the railroad
spike in through the lower

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.530 align:middle line:84%
orbit of his eye and through
the top of his skull.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:38.680 align:middle line:90%
And it blew out a hole.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Blew his head.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: And what
I did, though,

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.715 align:middle line:84%
is it severed the connections
between his frontal lobes

00:38:43.715 --> 00:38:44.590 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of his--

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It didn't kill him?

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.593 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Didn't kill him.

00:38:46.593 --> 00:38:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Miraculously, it
didn't kill him.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And so after he recovered,
he seemed normal

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:58.320 align:middle line:84%
except he began to exhibit
some very strange behavior that

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.480 align:middle line:90%
didn't exist before.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:05.400 align:middle line:84%
One of them was, he
became very uncooperative.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So we know, then,
that frontal lobes

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.210 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for this
cooperative types of behavior.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.690 align:middle line:84%
He would fly off the
handle into a rage.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:17.850 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't control
his emotions anymore.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.372 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't plan his activities.

00:39:20.372 --> 00:39:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's brain
related, no doubt.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Yeah, so we
looked at his brain.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And then in subsequent
years, we learned

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:29.200 align:middle line:90%
by seeing how behavior changes.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And each one of these
paranormal types of behaviors

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.780 align:middle line:84%
is linked to a frontal
lobes behavior.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.184 align:middle line:84%
Such as precognition,
for example.

00:39:39.184 --> 00:39:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Normally we say,
well, we can predict the future

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.120 align:middle line:90%
because of our experience.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Or we understand
cause and effect.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:84%
We understand the
cause of gravity.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen
if I were to let go?

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:58.374 align:middle line:84%
We know that gravity
would cause this to drop.

00:39:58.374 --> 00:40:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tommy's brain
just fell in your lap.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yeah.

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.310 align:middle line:90%
That's logic.

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:07.060 align:middle line:84%
We understand concepts of
time, what happens over time.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So the ability, normally,
to predict the future

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.269 align:middle line:84%
is computed, again,
in the frontal lobes.

00:40:12.269 --> 00:40:13.351 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That is amazing.

00:40:13.351 --> 00:40:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: But
precognition is, again,

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.070 align:middle line:84%
that ability to
predict the future,

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:22.930 align:middle line:84%
but it's extended beyond
simple sensory information,

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:90%
or beyond logic.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yet, some people
have a better ability to have

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:30.120 align:middle line:84%
precognitive
ability than others.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.850 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:36.472 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: I think it has to
do, again, with the filters.

00:40:36.472 --> 00:40:41.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've got a little
amygdala compass, here.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:42.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is my representation
of the amygdala.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So the amygdala is a
compass, in a sense.

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And as I spoke before,
the amygdala, when,

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:55.280 align:middle line:90%
you've got it pointing down now.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So when your amygdala
is red, right, it's

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.200 align:middle line:90%
telling you, danger.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.130 align:middle line:90%
This is not good for you.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, what
the amygdala does,

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:12.480 align:middle line:84%
if you'll let me have this, it
says run away from this object.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It points you away and it
gives you negative feedback.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, on the other
hand, when it sees something

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.660 align:middle line:90%
friendly--

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.535 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You've got
all kinds of toys, here.

00:41:21.535 --> 00:41:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yes.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.760 align:middle line:90%
It changes the direction.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.610 align:middle line:84%
It says, oh, this feels
good, go towards that.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So the amygdala is telling
you which way to go.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And like a compass, the compass
will give you a true north.

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, we have all
of these other influences.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know if
you have a compass,

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and we'll say this
is a magnet, if you

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:50.400 align:middle line:84%
have electromagnetic
interference, that

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.810 align:middle line:84%
will cause a diversion
of the compass.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And instead of pointing
towards true north,

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:00.149 align:middle line:84%
it'll say, oh, I
think this is north.

00:42:00.149 --> 00:42:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So the brain
could have some diversion?

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.481 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: It could have some
diversion and get some bad

00:42:04.481 --> 00:42:07.540 align:middle line:84%
information from some
external interference.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, that external interference
can be cultural conditioning,

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.920 align:middle line:84%
it can be peer
pressure, it could

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.822 align:middle line:90%
be bad television advertising.

00:42:18.822 --> 00:42:20.405 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It could
be physical damage.

00:42:20.405 --> 00:42:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: It could
be physical damage.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's all kinds of things
that will divert the amygdala.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So what you need
to do, if you want

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to engage brain
self-control, is start

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:36.792 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of those
things that would filter.

00:42:36.792 --> 00:42:38.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to get rid
of those bad filters.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, as you
wrote, tickle your amygdala.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Exactly.

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.188 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take some
questions from the audience

00:42:43.188 --> 00:42:43.990 align:middle line:90%
for you, Neil.

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Who's got one, as we talk
about the power of the brain?

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: So would you
consider remote viewing a type

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.380 align:middle line:90%
of trained precognition then?

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, remote viewing,
I would relate more to this

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.640 align:middle line:90%
what is called clairvoyance.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.980 align:middle line:84%
The ability to have an image,
a visual image inside the mind

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:13.550 align:middle line:84%
and brain, without having that
actual sensory data coming in.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So people who do remote vision
are seeing with the brain,

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:22.360 align:middle line:84%
without having the
stimulus coming in

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.830 align:middle line:84%
through their optic
nerve, or from maps,

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:29.780 align:middle line:84%
or even from being told
what exists somewhere else.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
are methods by which

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:37.520 align:middle line:84%
you can train yourself to
be more susceptible to that.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:41.890 align:middle line:84%
But I think many of us have
had those instances where

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:45.660 align:middle line:84%
we get a hunch, or when we
get that picture in our mind

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.630 align:middle line:84%
that's coming to us,
and it's spontaneous.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.330 align:middle line:84%
It just happens
when we might need

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:53.520 align:middle line:90%
that to happen, out of need.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it enhances
our survival,

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.539 align:middle line:90%
or our quality of life.

00:43:58.539 --> 00:43:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And let's take another
question for Neil.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:01.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Right here in the back.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I'm curious about
actual exercises or methods

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.010 align:middle line:84%
that you might suggest that
we can learn how to literally

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:14.866 align:middle line:84%
control the amygdala, and
how we can work with that.

00:44:14.866 --> 00:44:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Sure.

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think we'll get to
that later in the program.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give some
practical things.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.090 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
most important thing

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:26.890 align:middle line:84%
is to be aware of this
emotional compass.

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Because when we get
either sensory data,

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:34.260 align:middle line:84%
or we get paranormal
information,

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.260 align:middle line:84%
it always goes first
to the amygdala.

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.680 align:middle line:84%
We get a hunch and we feel
that something's not right.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Or we feel that we should
go in a certain direction.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the
amygdala is a shortcut.

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:55.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the fastest way for us
to respond to information,

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and it bypasses all the
complicated circuitry

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.590 align:middle line:84%
that's in the outer
portions of the brain.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a brain shortcut.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So as you become
sensitive to the amygdala,

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:12.170 align:middle line:84%
whether it's giving you
positive reinforcement,

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:15.410 align:middle line:84%
or that it's repelling
you from something because

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:18.940 align:middle line:84%
of negative feedback,
as you become

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:23.470 align:middle line:84%
aware of this switch going
forward at positive--

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So what I recommend to people
is just get something simple

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:30.780 align:middle line:90%
like a pen and a small pad.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And as you go through
your day, just keep notes.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And say, oh, my amygdala just
gave me positive emotion.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And jot that down.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.652 align:middle line:84%
And then when you feel like
an amygdala bite, right?

00:45:44.652 --> 00:45:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And you will.

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: You will.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's amygdala is
naturally clicking backwards

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and being tickled forwards by
external circumstances all day,

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.530 align:middle line:84%
every day, since the
day you were born.

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.330 align:middle line:84%
But you might not
be aware of it.

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So by using a pen
and a pad, you start

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.320 align:middle line:84%
to consciously
become aware of that.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And do that for a week.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the next step would
be to see if you can then

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:15.190 align:middle line:84%
consciously tickle your
amygdala so that you're

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:18.580 align:middle line:84%
clicking forward and opening
up those receptors in the more

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.220 align:middle line:90%
advanced part of your brain.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And do that as a
conscious act of will,

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.230 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to it clicking
forward and backward

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.222 align:middle line:84%
just because things
happen to happen.

00:46:29.222 --> 00:46:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Neil, do you find that
successful people are more apt

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.105 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do
these kinds of things?

00:46:35.105 --> 00:46:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yeah.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a natural--
you can make a correlation

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:45.810 align:middle line:84%
that people who are successful
have this natural ability

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:51.400 align:middle line:84%
to be in their frontal
lobes, where they understand

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.410 align:middle line:90%
what cooperation is.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:53.784 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They're positive.

00:46:53.784 --> 00:46:55.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a number
of factors there.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.158 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: That's right.

00:46:56.158 --> 00:46:58.770 align:middle line:90%
They stay in that I can do this.

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
letting their fear

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and their competitive
consciousness overwhelm them.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Even people who play
sports, for example.

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:16.590 align:middle line:84%
If you're a great basketball
player, or a great football

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.270 align:middle line:84%
player, or even someone
who is in track and field,

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.170 align:middle line:84%
for example, in these
competitive types of sports,

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.480 align:middle line:90%
you are competitive.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.450 align:middle line:10%
But what makes you
really successful

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:31.040 align:middle line:10%
is the ability to also cooperate
with your team members,

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.370 align:middle line:10%
with your coach.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And to cooperate with
your own inner self,

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:38.770 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to always
being in conflict,

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:42.300 align:middle line:84%
always being clicked backwards
into fear and fight or flight.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I had heard
that the greats,

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Mickey Mantle in baseball,
Gordy Hows in hockey,

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and people like
that, had an ability,

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:54.660 align:middle line:84%
probably through their
brain, to slow things down.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So Mantle, when he was
batting, had the ability

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:01.160 align:middle line:84%
to have the pitch, I don't
care how fast the pitcher was

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:05.910 align:middle line:84%
throwing it, it just kind of
like floated to him, visually.

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Gordy Hows, when
he played hockey,

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.310 align:middle line:84%
if somebody passed
him a puck, he

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:14.660 align:middle line:84%
used to say that it was as
if everything except him

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.600 align:middle line:90%
was in slow motion.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.065 align:middle line:90%
The puck came to him slow.

00:48:18.065 --> 00:48:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was just able to
manipulate around things.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Is that a brain function?

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.580 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, you're talking
about the ability to visualize

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.915 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing inside.

00:48:30.915 --> 00:48:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you lock it
in, and you slow it down.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:33.727 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yeah.

00:48:33.727 --> 00:48:34.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're--

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's
happening in real time,

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.620 align:middle line:90%
but they have slowed it down.

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: People often say,
when they are in a car accident,

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:46.290 align:middle line:84%
for example, everything
goes in slow motion.

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:51.270 align:middle line:84%
People who have experienced
psychoactive drugs that

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:54.500 align:middle line:84%
enhance perception
will talk about how

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:58.310 align:middle line:90%
time seems to slow down.

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But you're talking
about the ability

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.325 align:middle line:84%
to visualize the external
world internally.

00:49:05.325 --> 00:49:07.840 align:middle line:90%


00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:13.320 align:middle line:84%
A very interesting study, and
this has been done many times,

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.030 align:middle line:84%
had to do with,
what is the effect

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.380 align:middle line:84%
of visualization on
perfecting a skill?

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Critical,
I would think.

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: The study that comes
to mind had to do with doing

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.642 align:middle line:84%
free throws at a
basketball court.

00:49:27.642 --> 00:49:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:29.933 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: And you
had a control group,

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and then you had the
experimental group.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So the control group went
to the court every day.

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And for 20 minutes, they
practiced their free throws.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sometimes
without the ball.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Just the art of.

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, what this
experiment wanted to contrast,

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:49.540 align:middle line:84%
what the difference was between
actually physically doing it,

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and then the experimental
group didn't go to the court.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.125 align:middle line:84%
They just would spend the 20
minutes with their eyes closed.

00:49:56.125 --> 00:49:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And visualize it.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:00.179 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Visualizing
it in their head.

00:50:00.179 --> 00:50:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
experiment, what they found

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:05.340 align:middle line:84%
was that the experimental
group improved

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:08.800 align:middle line:84%
to nearly the same
degree as the people who

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.154 align:middle line:84%
spent a month of
practicing the free throws.

00:50:12.154 --> 00:50:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: And so, again, this
ability to visualize what

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:18.620 align:middle line:90%
you're doing.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.245 align:middle line:84%
And in that case that
you were talking,

00:50:20.245 --> 00:50:22.420 align:middle line:84%
of deliberately slowing
down, again, this

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:27.260 align:middle line:84%
is a frontal lobes
process inside the brain.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And it shows the
importance of that process

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.820 align:middle line:84%
within the brain of
abstract thought.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that ties in
with that paranormal ability

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about,
of moving objects or having

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.480 align:middle line:84%
objects move without
touching them.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.879 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like the watch.

00:50:49.879 --> 00:50:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Like the watch.

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Without the ability to have
some visualization of the result

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.710 align:middle line:84%
that you want, you
couldn't even begin

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:middle line:84%
to move objects
without touching them.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.560 align:middle line:84%
You first have to have
that visual frontal lobes

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.510 align:middle line:90%
process happening.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Give us some
techniques to be able to tickle

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.750 align:middle line:90%
one's amygdala.

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, the first-- I
brought something with me here,

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and this is rather
obv-- here's the pen.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.827 align:middle line:90%
Or here's the pad, rather.

00:51:16.827 --> 00:51:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first thing
that everyone should go out--

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just jot things down.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Now what does that do
by jotting that down?

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, people tend to
be left brain dominant or right

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.890 align:middle line:90%
brain dominant.

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:30.820 align:middle line:84%
People tend to
say, well, I don't

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:32.180 align:middle line:90%
need to write things down.

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us fall
into that category.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.950 align:middle line:84%
We feel like oh, yeah,
I'll remember it.

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:38.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you tend to be that
way, where you're not-- right

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:47.000 align:middle line:84%
brain tends to be very
global, very fuzzy.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.160 align:middle line:84%
The left brain tends to be
very focused on a small thing.

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Right brain is
nonverbal, its spatial.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Left brain is verbal and linear.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So to get your brain
to work at its optimum,

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:05.070 align:middle line:84%
you have got to have a
balance between right brain

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.910 align:middle line:90%
and left brain activities.

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And for most people, they often
forget to use their left brain.

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So I say, get yourself
a pen and a pad,

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.671 align:middle line:90%
and start to make written notes.

00:52:16.671 --> 00:52:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Of what?

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Of anything.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of
tickling your amygdala,

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:24.490 align:middle line:84%
we say, start to note
how you're feeling.

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I was waiting in line
at the bank and someone

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:33.100 align:middle line:84%
behind me told me a joke and
it put a smile on my face.

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:35.790 align:middle line:90%
You say bank, story, laugh.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it always
something emotional?

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, the amygdala is
an emotional hub in the brain.

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you can say someone
cut me off and I road raged

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.230 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: That's right.

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You write that down.

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Someone cut me
off, yeah, cutoff, car,

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and then you could put a
minus sign next to that.

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:55.089 align:middle line:84%
And when someone makes you
smile, you put a plus sign.

00:52:55.089 --> 00:52:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And once you get your
data, what do you do it?

00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Well, you
start to notice,

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.282 align:middle line:84%
you start to become aware that
you've got that button in both

00:53:03.282 --> 00:53:04.740 align:middle line:84%
the right brain
and the left brain.

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How do you balance it?

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.718 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: That's right.

00:53:06.718 --> 00:53:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, somebody
can say something

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and that'll click your
left amygdala forward.

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Other times, someone
can shake your hand,

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and that will click your
right brain forward,

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:18.757 align:middle line:90%
because that was--

00:53:18.757 --> 00:53:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A gesture.

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: That was nonverbal.

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.820 align:middle line:90%
So here's another thing.

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Here's a feather.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can find-- you can go
anywhere and find feathers.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.635 align:middle line:84%
You can go to the park
and you can find feathers.

00:53:28.635 --> 00:53:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Or you can go to a toy store.

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What am I
going to do with this?

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Well, I'll tell you.

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:39.820 align:middle line:84%
What you can do is, you
can tickle your amygdala

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.610 align:middle line:84%
by pretending that
you've got a feather

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and that you can tickle that
button inside your brain.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people say, well,
I can't visualize a feather.

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:51.170 align:middle line:90%
When I close, I can't see it.

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So I say, get yourself
a real feather

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and hold it up in
front of you look at.

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I want
to tickle it forward?

00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: And now take that
feather and just tickle

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:03.751 align:middle line:84%
the left amygdala and
then the right amygdala.

00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.300 align:middle line:90%
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.272 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I can
almost feel that.

00:54:06.272 --> 00:54:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yeah, right.

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And I hear people laughing,
because it's kind of funny.

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They're
laughing at me, Neil.

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: That's right.

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.330 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So you first do it with
a real object, all right.

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that
for a week, you'll

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:23.980 align:middle line:84%
find that when you close your
eyes, you can visualize that.

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I guarantee, if
you do that in a restaurant,

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:28.010 align:middle line:90%
you won't get served.

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: You may be right.

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:30.970 align:middle line:90%
You may be right.

00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do it at home, folks.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: So and you
know, here's the thing.

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:38.650 align:middle line:84%
When you visualize
something, and there

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:41.710 align:middle line:84%
are all kinds of different
ways to tickle the amygdala,

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:43.840 align:middle line:90%
you can do it with meditation.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.730 align:middle line:90%
You can do it with music.

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:47.310 align:middle line:90%
You can do it with art.

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:49.360 align:middle line:90%
You can do it with jokes.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.850 align:middle line:90%
You can do it with storytelling.

00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:54.770 align:middle line:84%
What brain research
and brain scans

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:58.970 align:middle line:84%
have shown us is, just
by thought alone, just

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:02.700 align:middle line:84%
by imagining that
you have a feather

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and that you're tickling
it, the brain scan

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:08.670 align:middle line:84%
will show activity
in the frontal lobes

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:10.110 align:middle line:90%
and in the amygdala.

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't just some kind of
pretend, New Age, hocus pocus.

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:18.110 align:middle line:84%
When you imagine that you're
tickling the amygdala,

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:22.200 align:middle line:84%
the brain scans now show us
that the amygdala is actually

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.240 align:middle line:90%
becoming activated.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And the frontal
lobes are actually--

00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And then you
begin to see a difference?

00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Absolutely.

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Because the frontal
lobes are automatically

00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:37.320 align:middle line:84%
programed to give your brain
positive emotions and reward.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.420 align:middle line:84%
When you turn on
your frontal lobes,

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:44.100 align:middle line:84%
nature wants you to
use more of your brain.

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at this.

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:46.410 align:middle line:90%
This is a life-sized model.

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you
wake up in the morning,

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.940 align:middle line:84%
is your frontal lobes
turned on, or not?

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: It may.

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:53.504 align:middle line:84%
If you hate your job,
it may not be on.

00:55:53.504 --> 00:55:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I see.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: OK.

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.590 align:middle line:84%
If you get up in the morning
and your first thought was,

00:55:57.590 --> 00:56:00.840 align:middle line:84%
I hate my job and I hate the
person I'm sleeping next to.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's back.

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Your amygdala
is clicked backwards.

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:05.398 align:middle line:84%
But if you wake up in
the morning and you

00:56:05.398 --> 00:56:06.940 align:middle line:90%
can't wait to go to work.

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And oh, I'm going to have
Cheerios for breakfast.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Your amyg-- right?

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:14.084 align:middle line:84%
So it just depends on which
part of your brain is working.

00:56:14.084 --> 00:56:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We got a
couple minutes to go.

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Why did you bring an umbrella?

00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Well, OK.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:24.132 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were talking about
tools and ways of clicking on,

00:56:24.132 --> 00:56:26.480 align:middle line:84%
you know, tickling your
amygdala and turning

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.810 align:middle line:84%
on your frontal lobes
so you can access

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:32.060 align:middle line:84%
all of these paranormal
types of phenomenon.

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So a definition of an
unusual tool, or for me,

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:40.880 align:middle line:84%
what I call a wand,
is something that you

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.780 align:middle line:90%
use in a non-conventional way.

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Now I'll give this to you, here.

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:49.840 align:middle line:84%
This is an umbrella
with a interesting Alice

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.051 align:middle line:90%
in Wonderland head there.

00:56:51.051 --> 00:56:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Kind of look, to it.

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.950 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Yeah, a flamingo head.

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Now if I say to
you, this is a tool.

00:56:57.150 --> 00:57:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I want you to use this
tool in the way that

00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:02.020 align:middle line:90%
is very conventional.

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.830 align:middle line:84%
If it were raining
inside the studio, that's

00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:06.210 align:middle line:90%
what you would do, right?

00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sorry folks,
but I'm really doing this.

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: OK, now, what makes
a wand magical is to use

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:16.930 align:middle line:84%
an ordinary tool
in an unusual way.

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, you
turn on your imagination.

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And then that leads to
this paranormal sensitivity

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.560 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking
about, that's

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.810 align:middle line:90%
associated with frontal lobes.

00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Now this time, instead of
holding it by the handle,

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:34.007 align:middle line:90%
hold it by the other end.

00:57:34.007 --> 00:57:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like this?

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: No, no, no.

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, upside down?

00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Exactly.

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Nope, here.

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.119 align:middle line:90%
Like this, George.

00:57:41.119 --> 00:57:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:43.057 align:middle line:90%
So what does this do?

00:57:43.057 --> 00:57:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: Now what
does that resemble?

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.342 align:middle line:90%
What does that remind you of?

00:57:47.342 --> 00:57:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A chandelier.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: Well, not quite.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:49.560 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you.

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you.

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.599 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been driven
past an Air Force Base?

00:57:54.599 --> 00:57:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, a satellite dish.

00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:57.407 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: It's a radar dish.

00:57:57.407 --> 00:57:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like a radar detector.

00:57:58.740 --> 00:57:59.698 align:middle line:90%
>> SLADE: That's right.

00:57:59.698 --> 00:58:03.100 align:middle line:84%
So what you do to use
an umbrella as a wand,

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:06.810 align:middle line:84%
is to gauge your
imagination, first.

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that you're
receiving information

00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:16.570 align:middle line:84%
from distance that you may
not have visual information.

00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:19.030 align:middle line:84%
You can receive
telepathic information.

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:20.777 align:middle line:90%
You can receive infor--

00:58:20.777 --> 00:58:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Neil, I'm
going to go out tonight,

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and hold an umbrella just like
that and walk down the street.

00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: This is your unusual
tool wand that you're using

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.496 align:middle line:90%
as a brain radar receiving dish.

00:58:30.496 --> 00:58:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: People want to get to
your website, where do they go?

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SLADE: They go
to brainradar.com.

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:37.340 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Brainradar.com.

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.000 align:middle line:10%
>> SLADE: Brainradar.com.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.150 align:middle line:10%
And there's 2000
pages of information.

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:47.220 align:middle line:84%

years.

00:58:52.779 --> 00:58:54.680 align:middle line:90%
