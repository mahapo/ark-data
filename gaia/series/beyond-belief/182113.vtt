>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:10%
You know, we have had many
guests on this program,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:10%
but this one is very
special to all of us,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:10%
because she's got
a heart of gold.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Her name is Roberta Grimes,
and she is a retired business

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:90%
attorney.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
She has spent decades
extensively studying the death

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:84%
process, life after death, the
amazing physics of the greater

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
reality, and the
nature of spirituality,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:84%
and the meaning of the
purpose of human life.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Try doing all that.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.325 align:middle line:90%
That's very busy, Roberta.

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERTA GRIMES: Well, you
know, everyone needs a hobby,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:90%
so that's been mine.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved in
all of this, as an attorney,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and then studying the
afterlife and spirituality?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, when
I was a small child--

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.498 align:middle line:90%
I was eight years old--

00:01:08.498 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in the
middle of the night.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.660 align:middle line:10%
I knew there was no god.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.083 align:middle line:90%
I was terrified.

00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of the room,
there was a flash of light,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and a voice said,
"You wouldn't know

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:84%
what it is to have
me, if you didn't know

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:90%
what it is to be without me.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:90%
I will never leave you again."

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At eight years old?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Eight years old.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when
you're eight, nothing

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:84%
surprises you, because
everything is surprising.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
understand that?

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Nope.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.920 align:middle line:84%
All I knew-- what my immediate
thought-- and I remember

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:90%
this-- was, oh, that's handy.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
If you forget there's
a god, they remind you.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:90%
And I went back to sleep.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.320 align:middle line:84%
But those experiences
remain forever fresh.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I majored in
Christianity in college.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.785 align:middle line:90%
That was a mistake, I thought.

00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You majored
in Christianity?

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: I did.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now, let me ask
you something for a second.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.760 align:middle line:90%
What is a major in Christianity?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I studied the
history of Christianity.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.353 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you get
a degree in that?

00:01:53.353 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Oh, yes.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And it gets you into law
school, believe it or not.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:84%
You can study, you
know, basket weaving

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:90%
and get into law school.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that strange?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:84%
You could have been a minister,
or whatever you wanted to do,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:90%
huh?

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.843 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I thought
that was my only option.

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I was waiting
for was someone

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.320 align:middle line:90%
to say what had happened to me.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
But I never asked a question,
and I never got an answer.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:90%
So I was really bummed.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Came home when I was 20, during
that summer, for my summer job,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and I sat down in my bed feeling
really disgusted with myself.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.867 align:middle line:84%
What do I do now,
with this major?

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wasn't even
Catholic, couldn't be a nun.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
you could do with it.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So over my right shoulder,
splashing in the room,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:90%
was the same light.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.072 align:middle line:84%
And the same voice said,
"I will never leave you."

00:02:34.072 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So that was how I knew
that what I remembered--

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.155 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From eight years
old, and then back to 20,

00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:90%
it pops up again.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And that was how I knew
that I had to find out

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:90%
what was behind the curtain.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've been
doing for my entire life.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you had this
degree in Christianity.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then you
go to law school?

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: What else can you do
with a degree in Christianity

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.578 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want
to be a minister?

00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:52.928 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have no idea.

00:02:52.928 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yeah, I
went to law school.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
school did you go to?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: BU.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Boston University.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, good school.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Very good school.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a better school now
than when I went, actually.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's great.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
took that degree,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and then you practiced
what kind of law?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I practiced
small business law.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:84%
For the past 30 years,
I've been working

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.180 align:middle line:84%
for family-owned businesses,
small businesses. $50 million

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.510 align:middle line:90%
would be very big for us.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Incorporating them,
contracts, all kinds of things,

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:18.870 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.578 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Mainly, it
was small businesses

00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:90%
that were family businesses.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm working now
with a business that

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.560 align:middle line:90%
is in its third generation.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:84%
We're raising the
fourth generation.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And they would run
the gamut of what?

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.765 align:middle line:84%
Cleaners, little restaurants,
things like that?

00:03:32.765 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: A foundry.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:90%
A lot of contractors.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.105 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Professional people,
doctors, dentists.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
still doing that,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:90%
or are you done with that now?

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I have just
retired finally from it.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.807 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
retired from that.

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And now you're devoting
your full time toward--

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:90%
what would we call it?

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.726 align:middle line:90%
What would you be now?

00:03:48.726 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:90%
A spiritual advisor, a teacher?

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:90%
What are you?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.662 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I'm a teacher
more than anything,

00:03:53.662 --> 00:03:55.142 align:middle line:84%
but I'm still
doing the research.

00:03:55.142 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens,
when you understand

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.160 align:middle line:84%
what happens at
death, and you then

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
understand how the universe is
part of this gigantic whole,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
you also learn, for the
first time, why we're here.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Why does the universe exist?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you learn that,
you become deeply involved

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.082 align:middle line:90%
in understanding spirituality.

00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:17.040 align:middle line:90%
That's where I'm going.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those are amazing
questions to ask people.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Because, if you can
get answers to that--

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:84%
because I ask them to
myself all the time--

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.382 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you're on to
something if you can do that.

00:04:29.382 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: The answers are
there, and they're obvious.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:84%
When you have done
enough of this research,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.148 align:middle line:90%
it all comes together.

00:04:35.148 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are you so
convinced that life after death

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:90%
exists?

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Why am I
convinced that you exist?

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, you can see me.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: I can see that, too.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I was very
skeptical in beginning.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:84%
What first got me, there was
a heyday of communication,

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:90%
which was about 100 years ago--

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.680 align:middle line:90%
long ago range.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them are in books.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
There were people who carefully
studied these communications,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:90%
and they're in books.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:84%
If you read all of those books,
which I did for a decade,

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
they're all talking
about the same place.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.300 align:middle line:90%
I'd saw no copying.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same
physics, the same process,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
the same way they dress,
the same things they do.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:90%
I'd never found an outlier.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you have hundreds
of communications

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
from people you used
to think were dead,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.345 align:middle line:84%
and they're talking
about where they are now,

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's all the same, even
I was convinced in the end.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if,
though, that there

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:84%
is this big scheme
by religion to create

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
this feeling that
life after death

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:84%
exists so they can control
you, so they can monitor you,

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:90%
so they can keep you in order.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Because without it, how
stark would life be?

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
If you actually believed
that this existence was it,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't you do things
a little differently?

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: What if it's
a scheme by religions?

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It can't be.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the first things
the dead make clear to us,

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.890 align:middle line:84%
when we talk to
them, is there is

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:90%
no religion that has it right.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
The death of Jesus on
the cross has never

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:84%
made a single difference for
one person in all this time.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:90%
That's not why he came.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Christianity has
it all wrong, and I

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:90%
bet they all have it all wrong.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So it certainly isn't
seen by religions,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
because religions
are going to die

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:90%
when everyone knows the truth.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But what would happen if
people knew the truth?

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
I've been wrestling with.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I think that, inevitably,
what would happen

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
would be that we
would all concentrate

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:90%
on growing spiritually.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Because what we don't
know is that we're here

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
for this very brief
period of time

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.800 align:middle line:84%
to raise our vibration away
from fear and toward love.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
all that exists.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Max Planck said that.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.868 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: And it's just
we all know it is true.

00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:42.285 align:middle line:84%
The only people
that don't know it

00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:84%
are the scientists who
refuse to believe it.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:84%
But we come here
because it's very hard

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:84%
to raise our vibration in what
we think of as the afterlife.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's really real life.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to raise
your consciousness vibration

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.660 align:middle line:84%
is to cease to be
stressed by negativity.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:10%
If there ever were a way to
be stressed by negativity,

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:10%
it's to come here
and take a lifetime.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And we plan all this awful
stuff into our lives.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, the old question,
why do bad things happen

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:90%
to good people?

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what they planned.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Because this is so-- there's
so little importance.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'll plan my
child will die.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'll plan I'll have
this horrible illness.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Because these are
great opportunities

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.643 align:middle line:84%
to be stressed and
grow spiritually.

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you live
your life differently,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.815 align:middle line:84%
if you believed there
was no afterlife?

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: I'm sure I would.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm sure I would.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
why not cheat people?

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Why not kill, if you
can get away with it?

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Why not grab money,
if money mattered?

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:84%
But once you know
what's going on,

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
you don't want anything, except
love, joy, and perfect harmony

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.430 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roberta, noted
neurologist, Dr. Eben

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Alexander, had a
near-death experience

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.122 align:middle line:90%
and came back to talk about it.

00:07:54.122 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:10%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: But,
in essence, it all

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:middle line:10%
started in what I call
the earthworm eye view.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:10%
Very primitive, course,
unresponsive realm,

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:10%
like being in dirty jello
with roots or blood vessels

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:10%
all around me.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:10%
And that seemed to go
on for a very long time.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:10%
Now, when I first came back to
this world and wrote it all up,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:10%
I thought that that earthworm
eye view, as I called it,

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:10%
was simply the best
consciousness my physical brain

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.650 align:middle line:10%
could muster when the
neocortex was being destroyed

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:10%
by bacterial meningitis.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:10%
The good news is that
didn't last forever.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:10%
I was rescued by a slowly
spinning, very clear

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:10%
white light, with fine
gold and silvery tendrils

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:10%
coming off of it.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:10%
And it had a perfect
musical melody.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:10%
And, as it came towards
me, slowly spinning,

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:10%
it opened up, like a rip in the
fabric of that ugly earthworm

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:10%
eye view, that course
realm, and led up

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:10%
into this brilliant,
ultra-real valley,

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:10%
what I call the gateway valley.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's gateway, because
it was only kind of the entry

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.290 align:middle line:10%
point to multiple levels going
all the way out to the core.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:10%
But that, I believe--

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:10%
that gateway valley--
is the same realm

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:10%
that I believe all
spiritually journeyers

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.850 align:middle line:10%
into the spiritual realm
over thousands of years

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:10%
have encountered
that same thing.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.820 align:middle line:10%
And it's often put together.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:10%
And then we come back with
some of our prior beliefs,

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:10%
and our personal mindset,
kind of shaping it.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:10%
And our words and
language reflects that.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:10%
But, in fact, when you read
many of these accounts--

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.550 align:middle line:10%
thousands of these
accounts-- what stands out

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:10%
are the similarities.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.560 align:middle line:10%
Now, in my particular
case, that gateway valley

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:10%
was a speck of awareness
on a butterfly wing.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.180 align:middle line:10%
There were millions
of other butterflies,

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:10%
and they were flying in
these looping spirals,

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:10%
and they were of colors
beyond the rainbow.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:10%
And they would--

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.207 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jeez, it's like being
in a kaleidoscope almost,

00:09:39.207 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: It was very
much like a kaleidoscope.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:10%
And then flying down
into that lush greenery,

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:10%
this valley was absolutely
fertile, rich, lush

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:10%
with life and creation.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:10%
No sign of any death or decay.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.710 align:middle line:10%
And going into that, I remember
sensing the flowers, buds,

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:10%
blossoms on trees.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:10%
Everything was always opening--
dynamic, creative, blooming.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:10%
Every bit of it.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:10%
And down below, in
this valley, were

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.820 align:middle line:10%
thousands of what I called in
my early writings villagers.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:10%
You know, they were
souls between lives.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:10%
Lots of joy and
dancing, merriment.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:10%
Children playing, dogs jumping.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:10%
I mean, incredible festivities.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:10%
And it was all being driven,
because, up above, were

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:10%
these golden orbs
of light swooping,

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:10%
leaving sparkling trails against
that blue-black, velvety sky.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.442 align:middle line:10%
And all the scene lit by these
billowing clouds of color.

00:10:32.442 --> 00:10:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, so there you go.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Is he not a witness
to the afterlife?

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: He's a witness to
some wonderful things that

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:90%
happened in the astral.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.620 align:middle line:84%
The people that we used
to think were dead,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and we have much better
communications now, actually,

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.170 align:middle line:84%
than ever before,
tell us consistently

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.260 align:middle line:84%
that nobody comes
back from death.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a one-way trip always.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.313 align:middle line:84%
So anyone like him,
who has been close--

00:10:57.313 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
have been many.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: There have been many.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And because it's such an
extraordinary experience,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:84%
many people say, oh,
I saw the afterlife.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.320 align:middle line:90%
None of them ever have.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.095 align:middle line:84%
In fact, near-death
experiences are aberrant.

00:11:09.095 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you tell
him that to his face?

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
If we want to know the
truth about the afterlife,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
we cannot entertain the
possibility that that kind

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:84%
of thing actually happens in the
afterlife, because it doesn't.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.853 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
afterlife, in your opinion?

00:11:24.853 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well,
here's the thing--

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.562 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you've never died.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:84%
You've never gone
to the other side.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:90%
So how would you know?

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Nobody
has, and come back.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Nobody, not one person.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:84%
I recently, I
should just add, had

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Raymond Moody on my
own program, which

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:84%
is called "Seek Reality
with Roberta Grimes."

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
He admitted-- he said he
doesn't know what goes

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:84%
on in the afterlife
really, because--

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.850 align:middle line:84%
he even said, I
thought this was cute--

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.487 align:middle line:84%
that's why I call them
near-death experiences,

00:11:49.487 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:84%
because they weren't
real death experiences.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is it,
though, in your opinion?

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:55.428 align:middle line:90%
I guess you don't know.

00:11:55.428 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No, I do.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing--
most of reality

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:84%
is what's called
the astral plane.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.840 align:middle line:84%
It's many times the size of
this entire physical universe.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:90%
It's gigantic.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Think of it as a desert.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And, in that desert,
there are oases.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:90%
There are small cities.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's one
gorgeous, gigantic city.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.620 align:middle line:90%
That's our afterlife.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.627 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of city is it?

00:12:20.627 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: It's-- because--

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it Shangri-La?

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Think of it
as an energy barrier

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
around that core city,
which is our afterlife.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:84%
You can't go through
it and come back out.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.640 align:middle line:84%
He could never go through
it and come back out.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.720 align:middle line:84%
In a near-death experience
that's extensive, often

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
you'll get to a point where
you will hear a voice saying,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
you are about to
enter the afterlife.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a one-way trip.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And then people have
to make a choice.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I want to die now,
or I'm going to wait.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Many NDEs have that happen.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a hell?

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: There is no hell.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:84%
There is what Jesus
called an outer darkness.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about then
how this is all constructed.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
exists is consciousness.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness exists at
a range of vibrations

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:84%
from the lowest, which is fear,
to the highest, which is love.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And, in the afterlife,
all of it exists--

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and actually, here,
too, although we

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
believe there's a lot
more space than there is--

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
but, in the afterlife, it
all exists in the same place.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when you
die, it's really simple.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is right
now tuned to that body

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.578 align:middle line:90%
on this level of reality.

00:13:27.578 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you think you're
in that body, but you aren't.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:90%
You're not even close to it.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.363 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:13:32.363 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: So what
happens when you

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:84%
die is that your
mind, like a TV set,

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.630 align:middle line:84%
just tunes to a slightly higher
vibration of consciousness.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doesn't shut off?

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Nope.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible for
your mind to die.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is part of eternity.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.150 align:middle line:84%
There is no time, and
there is no space.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you exist now,
you always existed,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:90%
and you always will exist.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Time is meaningless
to something that's

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:90%
eternal, which your mind is.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, you tune to this
slightly higher vibration,

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.795 align:middle line:84%
and there you pick up a
whole new solid reality

00:14:02.795 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:90%
right in the same place.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.475 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so what
you're saying, though, Roberta,

00:14:05.475 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:84%
is someone like
Dannion Brinkley, who

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
claims he's died several times
and has come back, did not die.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No, he didn't die.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Where do the experiences
come from that people have?

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Those who are aiding them
through this experience

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:84%
of being out of their
bodies pull from their minds

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:84%
information, and give
it to them in ways

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:84%
that are meant to help
them grow spiritually.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So if someone is
religious, they're not

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.800 align:middle line:84%
going to be shown that there's
no religion, there's no god,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:84%
there's no anything
that they believe in.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.850 align:middle line:84%
If they believe they
should go to hell,

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be in hell.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Then they'll go,
oh, my goodness,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.802 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be in hell, and
immediately they're out of it

00:14:42.802 --> 00:14:43.602 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:14:43.602 --> 00:14:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you are
absolutely convinced that there

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:90%
is an afterlife?

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.332 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Oh, sure.

00:14:50.332 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But how do you know?

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.850 align:middle line:90%
You're not-- you never died.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:90%
So how would you know?

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I think, eventually,
you get hit over the head

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:84%
enough times by the same facts,
you start to accept them.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're saying that
the facts you've accumulated

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:90%
have convinced you about this?

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
they all fit together.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:90%
There's this gigantic whole.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we find
something new-- at this point,

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.230 align:middle line:84%
we have so much knowledge
and information--

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.090 align:middle line:90%
we look at how it fits.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't fit,
we put it over here.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
We say, maybe it fits,
but we aren't sure yet.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:84%
People who are doing
this work seriously--

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.011 align:middle line:84%
and there's a whole group of
people, as you know, who are--

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:84%
don't easily add things
to whatever it is we're

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.100 align:middle line:90%
assembling.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But we are assembling
a true picture

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:90%
of what reality actually is.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:41.227 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing feat
of believing what it might be.

00:15:41.227 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Or knowing
what it might be.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have
any other evidence

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:90%
that would back this up?

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, we have
all kinds of evidence.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's--

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a lawyer.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:84%
You know what
evidence is all about.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yeah, but I was
never a courtroom lawyer.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was kind
of an icky thing to do,

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:90%
so I never did it.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So I tend to be more
of a consensus person.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.770 align:middle line:84%
All the evidence points to
the same thing, evidence--

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That there's something.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: No,
exactly what it is.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have so many accounts
of what the afterlife is like.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.350 align:middle line:84%
We know, for example,
that there are

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:84%
almost infinite gradations
of consciousness

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.790 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife levels.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And we-- for convenience,
someone named George Meek,

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, 50, 70 years ago--

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.417 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know,
the voice machine

00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:25.450 align:middle line:90%
for contacting the dead.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well,
one of the things

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:84%
he did was to give
us a handy way

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:84%
to look at all those
infinite gradations.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So we use his formula, which
is there are seven levels.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:84%
The lowest is what Jesus called
the outer darkness, where

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.380 align:middle line:84%
there'll be wailing
and gnashing of teeth.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which some
people would call hell?

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.007 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Yeah,
but it's not fiery.

00:16:44.007 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:90%
God doesn't put you there.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.230 align:middle line:90%
You put yourself there.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's not
Lucifer running around--

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --pitchforking you?

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
It is basically you
have exiled yourself

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
from interaction with
people, because you

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:90%
have condemned yourself.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.005 align:middle line:90%
You can't forgive yourself.

00:17:01.005 --> 00:17:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Learning to forgive yourself is
the most important thing anyone

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.270 align:middle line:84%
can do, because
the day will come

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:84%
when you are in a situation
where you are trying

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to understand your whole
life and put it together,

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.787 align:middle line:84%
and around you are your
guides, other advisors,

00:17:14.787 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to say, OK, forgive

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:90%
everybody that ever harmed you.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care what they did,
you always immediately forgive.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Then they're going to
say, now forgive yourself.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion, take
us through the dying process,

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and then what
happens after that.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: OK.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Most people, virtually all of
us, take planned exit points.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
When we're planning our-- we
plan our lives ahead of time

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
with our guides, and
with other advisors,

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and with the people
who are going

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.218 align:middle line:84%
to be important in our lives,
like who we're going to marry

00:17:44.218 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, once that
plan is all put together

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and we have been allowed to
select a body, we're born.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.588 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: But our guides
are right there with us,

00:17:53.588 --> 00:17:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to
make sure that we hit

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.125 align:middle line:90%
the marks we set for ourselves.

00:17:58.125 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All along the way?

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: All along the way.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:84%
No one can be in a body
without a spirit guide.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So everybody listening
has a spirit guide.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you go
through your life.

00:18:06.135 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yep, go
through your life.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:07.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do your thing.

00:18:07.895 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Some are good, some are
bad, but you do your thing,

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and then you get old
and sick, and you die.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Or you do it young.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you do
it young, sadly.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yeah, or sad-- or
maybe it was planned that way.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know, but--

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Mikey Morgan
was a very advanced being,

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:84%
who decided to take
a short lifetime.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And we usually plan two
or three exit points

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:84%
into our lives, usually
one early, one middle,

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:90%
and one in old age.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.588 align:middle line:84%
He planned two, and the
second one was at 20.

00:18:33.588 --> 00:18:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So he was going to leave at
20, regardless, and he did.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's short, to me.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Very short.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yeah,
but he just wanted

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.100 align:middle line:84%
to get a flavor of who we
are, so he could teach us.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.120 align:middle line:84%
His book is called "Flying High
in Spirit," and it's out again.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:90%
It's terrific.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right, so, anyways,
regardless of the age, you die.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.468 align:middle line:90%
Your physical body is now done.

00:18:51.468 --> 00:18:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: It could
be in an accident.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Those are planned as
well, almost always.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.338 align:middle line:84%
It could be from an illness,
or it could be from old age.

00:18:58.338 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:84%
But you're heading
for an exit point,

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and your higher
consciousness, because we

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:84%
leave probably 90% of our minds
inaccessible to us, and they,

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and our guides, and we, at night
when we meet with our guides,

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:84%
work out, well, should
we take this exit point?

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've done most of
what we can with this lifetime.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:90%
So you're 48, or something.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And you now know, at a level way
above your conscious awareness,

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
take this exit point.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Over and over again, I'll
talk with people about people

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:84%
who have just died, and you can
see that, for a year, often,

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.208 align:middle line:84%
they were in a process
of winding it up.

00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:37.500 align:middle line:84%
They did things they had
planned to do all their lives.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.710 align:middle line:84%
They reconnected
with loved ones.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Very often, husbands will say,
OK, here are the passwords,

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.107 align:middle line:90%
or here are the bank accounts.

00:19:45.107 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, this is where the
money's stashed, or whatever.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Right.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:90%
We wrap it up.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:90%
But so, you die.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: You die.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now what happens?

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, as
you're approaching death,

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.480 align:middle line:84%
usually your body is, as
we know, falling apart.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.238 align:middle line:84%
Your body wants
to survive, so you

00:19:59.238 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:90%
have to get it really weakened.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.447 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It fights it.

00:20:01.447 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:84%
During the few days
before your death,

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:84%
usually there's a
burst of energy.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Doctors see that
as death is coming.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:15.045 align:middle line:84%
And then, within about
24 hours or thereabouts,

00:20:15.045 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:84%
or up to just an hour
or two before you die,

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.930 align:middle line:84%
you suddenly see people around
your bed you thought were dead.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:90%
They look young, healthy, happy.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's one.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's a crowd.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.077 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes
relatives that died.

00:20:28.077 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Often, it's relatives.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.368 align:middle line:84%
It could be people who
were just close friends.

00:20:31.368 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:90%
It could be a pet.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you
don't get visited at all?

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: You always do.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.348 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: And the reason seems
to be because, otherwise, we

00:20:40.348 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:84%
are as clueless when we
leave our bodies as we

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.680 align:middle line:90%
were when we left our mothers.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So do they kind of
like take you along with them?

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:90%
They comfort you.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.752 align:middle line:84%
And, usually, people will
stop talking to the living

00:20:50.752 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:90%
when they first see the dead.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Here, Roberta, let's
take you to the other side.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Follow us.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
basically, the first--

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.460 align:middle line:90%
here's a bit of warning.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Never-- when you first
see people who are living,

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.412 align:middle line:84%
be very careful about
not paying attention--

00:21:05.412 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:84%
living that you
thought were dead--

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
be careful about
paying attention

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.310 align:middle line:84%
to the people around
you, around your bedside.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Because they'll be upset.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways
people can get stuck

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
is to try to comfort the
people around their bedside,

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.230 align:middle line:84%
once they're out
of their bodies.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you mean by stuck?

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Like, they don't leave?

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:90%
Like a ghost would stay.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: You become
an earthbound, yes.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume you now move
on with these other entities,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.298 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are
they taking you?

00:21:32.298 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: They're-- we think
they're taking us to a distant

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:90%
place, but they're not.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Because, as we are leaving
that room, we notice

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:84%
it starts to get
vague and vapory.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.700 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is
raising our vibration.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:90%
They're helping us do that.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.115 align:middle line:84%
As we raise our
vibration, we kind of go

00:21:50.115 --> 00:21:52.240 align:middle line:84%
through a period of fog,
but they're right with us.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: And then,
the fog clears,

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and we pick up this
beautiful reality,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.922 align:middle line:84%
which is right in the
same place that room was.

00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: That's how it actually
happens, if you're awake.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a
glorious place to be?

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:84%
It's made of a different
kind of matter.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Think of alabaster, but
brilliantly colored.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.592 align:middle line:90%
It's got beautiful scenery.

00:22:16.592 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see angels with
harps and the little wings?

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: No, you
see regular people

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:90%
doing interesting things.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And, often, they're wearing
just regular clothing.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:25.490 align:middle line:90%
What we call--

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.702 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you know your dead?

00:22:27.702 --> 00:22:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, if you don't,
you soon figure it out.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do, eventually?

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: But you have
your loved ones with you.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That have passed on?

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And they'll answer your
questions and stuff.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.540 align:middle line:84%
You have your guides
with you, as well.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Many of-- we typically
enter at level three.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And those entrances,
at level three, are--

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:84%
which is-- remember, we talked
about the outer darkness.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Then
there's a level two.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Level three, four,
and five, those

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.690 align:middle line:84%
are what we call the
Summerland levels.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:55.740 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:90%
They're solid.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
They're the most beautiful
scenery you can imagine.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Nothing dies.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:90%
Nothing fades.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:84%
The flowers will follow
you, you know, as you go by.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:90%
They give off music.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:90%
They give off a beautiful scent.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.577 align:middle line:84%
They're in colors
you've never seen,

00:23:10.577 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:84%
because they're beyond the
visible light spectrum.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:90%
It's gorgeous.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:84%
In the North
American Summerland,

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:84%
if we look off to
a little distance,

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:90%
you can see the Rocky Mountains.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: In the
British Summerland--

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:84%
very similar to the North
American Summerland--

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:90%
there are no mountains.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Our friend that we've been
talking about, Raymond Moody,

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.410 align:middle line:84%
has a new series on
Gaia called "Legacy."

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Uh-huh.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.557 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:23:35.557 --> 00:23:37.890 align:middle line:10%
>>RAYMOND MOODY: That they
hear the doctor say something

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:10%
like, oh, my god, he's dead.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:10%
Or we've lost her.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:10%
Which is very
surprising to them,

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:10%
because they say
that, I have never

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:52.890 align:middle line:10%
felt so alive as when I heard
that doctor say I was dead.

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:10%
Because, from their
point of view,

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.440 align:middle line:10%
they feel that they
distance themselves

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.360 align:middle line:10%
from their physical body.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.750 align:middle line:10%
And they watch the scene of
the resuscitation, typically

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:10%
from the point of view above it.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:10%
As this progresses, they
eventually wake up to the fact

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:10%
that, oh, this must be
something to do with death.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:10%
And, at that point, they enter
into states of consciousness

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:10%
that, no matter how
articulate they may be,

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:10%
they say there are
no words for it.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:10%
That it's ineffable
or indescribable.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They go through a passageway
into a beautiful light.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.910 align:middle line:10%
They feel comfort,
peace, and joy.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:10%
They meet relatives and friends
of theirs who have died.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:10%
And they go through
panoramic memory,

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:10%
in which everything
they've ever done

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.480 align:middle line:10%
is displayed around them in
a sort of holographic three

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.550 align:middle line:10%
dimensional panorama.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:50.580 align:middle line:10%
And they come back
from these experiences

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.430 align:middle line:10%
with a total new take
on life, thinking

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.490 align:middle line:10%
that the most important thing
we can do while we're here

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:10%
is to learn how to
love, and saying

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:10%
that they have no
more fear of death,

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.670 align:middle line:10%
because they feel
that death is just

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.027 align:middle line:10%
a transition into
some other reality.

00:25:06.027 --> 00:25:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of that, Roberta?

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I think
he's a lovely man.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:11.580 align:middle line:84%
He coined the term--
in case anyone

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.350 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know this--
near-death experiences.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, he did.

00:25:14.225 --> 00:25:16.008 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: And what
he describes there

00:25:16.008 --> 00:25:18.300 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful near-death
experience and a very typical

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:90%
one.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Near-death experiences
prove our minds easily

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.360 align:middle line:84%
exist when our brains
are not functioning.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a very
important kind of proof.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They also happen in the astral,
with our guides around us,

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.140 align:middle line:84%
often our loved ones around us,
and we learn beautiful things.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Very often, people will say,
I learned all this stuff,

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and then I never forgot
it when I got back here.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.660 align:middle line:90%
That's by design.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:84%
You need to know there's
more, but it's not time

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:84%
for you to know what
that all is yet.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So I don't mean
to diminish NDEs.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:84%
They're extraordinary, and
I'm so grateful they happen.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just important
we understand they

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.020 align:middle line:90%
don't happen in the afterlife.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:90%
They happen in the astral plane.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think the
dying process is something

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.170 align:middle line:90%
that we should be scared of?

00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Dying is like the best
time of your life.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:02.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, no, no, no.

00:26:02.745 --> 00:26:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I'm
serious about that.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe for you.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:05.790 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: That's
why my first book

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:10%
was called "The Fun of Dying."

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.380 align:middle line:10%
It really is.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I know.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.680 align:middle line:10%
It was an interesting title.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.632 align:middle line:84%
But you know what, I'm
in no hurry to get there.

00:26:14.632 --> 00:26:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: No, but you--
it's not your time yet.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.200 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't be in
a hurry to get there.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm older than you are,
and I'm at a point now

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.438 align:middle line:84%
where I look forward to it,
but I know I can't go yet.

00:26:24.438 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
not ready for it.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No, I'm not.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But I'm certainly
not afraid of it.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when
the time comes--

00:26:31.425 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Party time.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --so be it.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes, yes.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you mean party time?

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: It's party time.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
do on the other side?

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.200 align:middle line:90%
You go dancing?

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: You do
whatever you want to do.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:39.810 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.230 align:middle line:90%
You have a body that is young.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Typically, we choose
to look the way

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
we looked in our
most recent lifetime,

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:90%
when we were maybe 25 to 35--

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:90%
that range.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Because that's when we usually
looked and felt the best.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My hair
was too long then.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.090 align:middle line:90%
I didn't like that.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, you know what,
you can have shorter hair.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.850 align:middle line:90%
You can redesign your body.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:84%
You could have a body
from an earlier lifetime,

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:90%
if you choose.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:84%
But that body is equipped
with sensory organs

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:90%
that are much stronger.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:84%
People say you've
never heard music

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.020 align:middle line:90%
unless you heard it there.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.170 align:middle line:84%
It's extra-- the music
is extraordinary.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
You can't-- even people who--
there was one fellow who died

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:90%
100 or some years ago.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.607 align:middle line:84%
His family was worried
because he was almost blind.

00:27:20.607 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
can you see better dad?

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'll tell
you how well I can see.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
About 50 miles from
here, it looks like there

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:28.950 align:middle line:90%
are beautiful mountain--

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:29.750 align:middle line:90%
Rocky Mountains.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 50 miles?

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yes, I
can see-- so I--

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
could see that far here.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said that, in
front of those mountains,

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.300 align:middle line:84%
there are foothills
covered with trees.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.297 align:middle line:84%
I can see, from here,
every leaf on every tree

00:27:45.297 --> 00:27:46.380 align:middle line:90%
on all of those foothills.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
pretty good vision.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Excellent.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.902 align:middle line:90%
And it's almost panoramic.

00:27:49.902 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't think it's quite
panoramic, but pretty much.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.277 align:middle line:84%
So you can see what's behind
you and all around you.

00:27:54.277 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the afterlife
almost like the physical life?

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they
watch television?

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.472 align:middle line:90%
Do they listen my show on radio?

00:28:00.472 --> 00:28:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: That's an
interesting question.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Because what I read
was all 100 years ago.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:90%
There was no technology at all.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.365 align:middle line:90%
So they have no basis.

00:28:09.365 --> 00:28:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Now, more
recently, there's quite a bit

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.920 align:middle line:90%
more technology.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:84%
For example, my
mother showed me--

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:18.490 align:middle line:90%
we were working--

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I was working with a
medium, and my mother

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.840 align:middle line:84%
showed the medium that there's
a big TV on their wall.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
She said, using this TV, I can
watch my loved ones on Earth

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.050 align:middle line:90%
any time I want to.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.520 align:middle line:90%
I just turn it on and I love--

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I love watching Roberta, because
she's always up to something.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
passionate about this.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: I guess.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I guess I am passionate.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the hall of records?

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, what about our
life reading that they say

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.830 align:middle line:90%
is in the book?

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Well, here's-- we do--

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.510 align:middle line:90%
we do a life review.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.335 align:middle line:84%
And, as Raymond pointed out,
there's a limited life review

00:28:53.335 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:84%
often-- or I can't
remember who did it.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.470 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was Eben.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.900 align:middle line:10%
So we do all of that, and
we get to see this lifetime.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.180 align:middle line:84%
But many of us are curious
about prior lifetimes.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, in our mind, when
we first rejoin it,

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:84%
is the memories of
our major lifetimes.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
We already know, you know,
oh, yes, I was Julius Caesar,

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.150 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.275 align:middle line:90%
We already know that stuff.

00:29:12.275 --> 00:29:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But we're interested
in the less--

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.920 align:middle line:84%
sort of less
important lifetimes.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So there is a way
to review them.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And we think what happens is
you go to this big library,

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:90%
and you basically revisit--

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With your
loved ones maybe?

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.052 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Or by yourself.

00:29:27.052 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people do
this by themselves.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:33.385 align:middle line:84%
And you revisit the life review
hologram for that lifetime.

00:29:33.385 --> 00:29:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And basically
you're in it again.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.480 align:middle line:84%
You can research almost anything
in those halls of records.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've never
seen somebody so jovial

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.190 align:middle line:90%
about death in all my life.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, wouldn't it
be great if everybody was?

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.792 align:middle line:84%
And if everybody knew what
I know, they would be.

00:29:47.792 --> 00:29:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't see any
morbidity about it at all,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.800 align:middle line:90%
do you?

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No, no.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Which is hard
sometimes on people

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.335 align:middle line:90%
who have just lost someone.

00:29:54.335 --> 00:29:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, of course.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Because my
first reaction is--

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
could understand that.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: --good for him.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:59.503 align:middle line:90%
Could He finally got to go home.

00:29:59.503 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't go to a
funeral laughing, do you?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I don't
usually go to funerals.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.508 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, I guess if I had
someone very close to me die,

00:30:07.508 --> 00:30:09.050 align:middle line:84%
but it's been a long
time since I had

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.342 align:middle line:90%
a relative or close friend die.

00:30:10.342 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, would you look in
the casket and go, you made it.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I usually--
when my mother died,

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.220 align:middle line:90%
we didn't even look at her body.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.410 align:middle line:90%
What would be the point?

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.410 align:middle line:90%
It was a closed casket.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be cremated.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:23.108 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
like open caskets.

00:30:23.108 --> 00:30:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No, it's horrible.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm not cremated,
I will haunt my husband,

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.800 align:middle line:90%
just so he knows that.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You make it sound--

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.460 align:middle line:90%
and take it, please, politely--

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:37.200 align:middle line:84%
you make it sound like it's a
party time on the other side.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: It is a party time.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a happy time.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.607 align:middle line:84%
I mean, imagine if you've
gone through your whole life

00:30:44.607 --> 00:30:47.190 align:middle line:84%
thinking that you were going to
die and that would be the end,

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and then you get to this
gorgeous place, and they say,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.990 align:middle line:84%
guess what, your
life is eternal.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.668 align:middle line:84%
You were just away
for a few minutes.

00:30:53.668 --> 00:30:54.960 align:middle line:90%
We're so glad to have you home.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
reincarnation fit into this?

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Reincarnation
does happen.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.772 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the last things
I was willing to accept.

00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:02.730 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't happen--

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'd fought that, huh?

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: I'm sorry?

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You fought that?

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Big time.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Big time, I fought it.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I was very Christian
during a lot of this period.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation happens,
but it doesn't happen

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.770 align:middle line:90%
the way we think it does.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Because beyond this
material universe,

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:84%
everything is without
time and without space.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So, without time,
all your lifetimes

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.720 align:middle line:90%
are happening at the same time.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're influencing
one another, which

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:35.580 align:middle line:90%
is why, when Brian Weiss does--

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.600 align:middle line:90%
was it Brian?

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Whatever his first name is.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.660 align:middle line:84%
When he does his past
life regressions--

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is Brian Weiss.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: OK.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.950 align:middle line:84%
When he does his past
life regressions,

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:45.780 align:middle line:84%
he can pick up
something that happened

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:84%
in an earlier lifetime that's
influencing your lifetime now.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.760 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you remember
it, you lose that fear,

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.470 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the problem was.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I had a fear of falling
off a high place,

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.170 align:middle line:84%
until I spontaneously
remembered a lifetime

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.330 align:middle line:84%
as a young Indian man
who thought he could fly.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:03.015 align:middle line:84%
And that dumb kid, he
just flew off a cliff.

00:32:03.015 --> 00:32:04.140 align:middle line:90%
And that was the end of it.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the dead have
fun, in your opinion?

00:32:06.165 --> 00:32:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Oh, they
have so much fun.

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.120 align:middle line:90%
It's just a fact.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They do have a
tremendous amount of fun.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you need money?

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
need any of that?

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: That was one
of the first things

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.177 align:middle line:90%
my mother-in-law said.

00:32:17.177 --> 00:32:18.450 align:middle line:90%
She was a Depression--

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.325 align:middle line:84%
you know, she'd lived
through the Depression.

00:32:20.325 --> 00:32:22.117 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you can
do anything you want,

00:32:22.117 --> 00:32:23.160 align:middle line:90%
and you don't need money.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.040 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
thing she said

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.760 align:middle line:90%
when we communicated with her.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.900 align:middle line:90%
No money.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you young again?

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yep.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doing things
you want to do?

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yep.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's got
to be a downside here.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: The downside
is that, above you,

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.120 align:middle line:84%
if you are level three
or four, above you,

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.960 align:middle line:84%
you know is much more glory
than you can even imagine.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that heaven?

00:32:48.625 --> 00:32:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: That's--
well, the very top--

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What we call heaven?

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: All of it is heaven.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.680 align:middle line:90%
All of it's lovely.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But you want to
grow spiritually,

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.490 align:middle line:90%
because that's the thing there.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Here, you want money.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:02.920 align:middle line:84%
There, you want to
grow spiritually.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Every craving you've had in
your whole life put together

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.010 align:middle line:84%
is how much you crave
to grow spiritually.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you
could live that way now,

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.590 align:middle line:90%
when you're still alive?

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.737 align:middle line:84%
What would that do to
you, as a human being?

00:33:16.737 --> 00:33:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: That's what we're
trying to make happen.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.280 align:middle line:84%
That highest afterlife
level-- level 6--

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.050 align:middle line:84%
is what Jesus called
the Kingdom of God.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.950 align:middle line:84%
What he came to
do 2,000 years ago

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:29.470 align:middle line:84%
was teach us how to bring
the Kingdom of God on Earth.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:30.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.260 align:middle line:90%
No one listens to him.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So what we're trying to do
now is make that happen.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And it will be glorious beyond
what anyone can imagine.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you get
the word out about this?

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, I talk
to you, for one thing.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.900 align:middle line:84%
We're in the process
of establishing

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:47.950 align:middle line:90%
an online university.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have to do that.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
We're raising the
money now to do it.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But there-- once everybody
knows all of this,

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.650 align:middle line:84%
there'll be no war, no
more wars, no more crime,

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.480 align:middle line:90%
no more hatred, no more--

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:90%
no more anything negative.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.930 align:middle line:90%
All the negativity will go away.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Psychic
Carolyn Molnar had this

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:06.250 align:middle line:84%
to say about what the
spirits do in the afterlife,

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:07.670 align:middle line:90%
much like what you're saying.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.337 align:middle line:10%
>>CAROLYN MOLNAR:
What I've come to know

00:34:09.337 --> 00:34:11.860 align:middle line:10%
is that, if somebody is a
homemaker and loves their home,

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.177 align:middle line:10%
they're going to have a
beautiful, spotless home,

00:34:14.177 --> 00:34:15.969 align:middle line:10%
and they don't have to
worry about dusting,

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:18.048 align:middle line:10%
because there's no
dust over there.

00:34:18.048 --> 00:34:19.090 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's wonderful.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.870 align:middle line:10%
And they want to make their
wonderful gourmet food,

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.730 align:middle line:10%
all they have to do
is snap their fingers

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:28.030 align:middle line:10%
and it's all done, because
it's all through thought.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.500 align:middle line:10%
They can eat, if they want to.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.360 align:middle line:10%
They don't have to.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.730 align:middle line:10%
If they love to play
sports, they will.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.130 align:middle line:10%
They will not be in
their old bodies.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:41.469 align:middle line:10%
If they died at age 86, and
they want to be 32, they will.

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:46.510 align:middle line:10%
Oftentimes, I've had 32-year-old
grandfathers coming in.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.330 align:middle line:10%
They go, well, it sounds
right, except he wasn't 32.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:50.370 align:middle line:10%
He was 86.

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.780 align:middle line:10%
And I'd say, well, guess what.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.408 align:middle line:10%
He wants to be 32, and he is.

00:34:55.408 --> 00:34:57.700 align:middle line:10%
You know, and if he was a
great baseball player, that's

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:10%
what they want to
do, or whatever,

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:10%
if they want to play
cards with their friends,

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.100 align:middle line:10%
they will do that.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.870 align:middle line:10%
It's an amazing experience.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.060 align:middle line:10%
On top of all that,
they get to and learn,

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.280 align:middle line:10%
if they want to, to progress
their soul, to get more ideas.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Which reminds me of a
story, which I'll tell you.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: OK.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Two dear
friends, Rose and Betty,

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.680 align:middle line:90%
were friends from school.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.820 align:middle line:90%
They'd lived together.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.420 align:middle line:90%
They dated guys together.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.370 align:middle line:90%
And they grew old together.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And they made a pact
with each other.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And the pact was,
whoever dies, comes back

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and tells the other person
what it's really like.

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:39.850 align:middle line:90%
And that was the pact.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:43.480 align:middle line:90%
And then, one day, Betty died.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And Rose is in bed sleeping one
night, and she hears a voice.

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:53.950 align:middle line:90%
Rose, Rose, Rose.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Rose wakes up.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Betty?

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Betty is that you?

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Rose.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.320 align:middle line:90%
It's me.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the other side.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Betty, what's it like?

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.530 align:middle line:90%
What's it like?

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's good
news and bad news.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.110 align:middle line:90%
What's the good news?

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm young again, and we
play softball every day,

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's always sunny,
and it's gorgeous.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's the bad news?

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Rose, you're pitching tomorrow.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Oh, no.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.380 align:middle line:90%
That's cute.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
nice story, isn't it?

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Very cute.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what it tells you
is that let's not be in a hurry

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.160 align:middle line:90%
to get to the other side.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.435 align:middle line:90%
You seem to be anxious.

00:36:43.435 --> 00:36:47.522 align:middle line:90%


00:36:47.522 --> 00:36:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: I'm excited--

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I have spent my life
decades studying this.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I know it's true.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.560 align:middle line:90%
I know it's real.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know I'll have
much more fun there,

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:59.250 align:middle line:90%
and I won't be in this old body.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I'll look the way I looked in
my 20s, which was gorgeous.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And so why wouldn't
I want to be there?

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.930 align:middle line:90%
The problem is this--

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I came in with
reasons to be here.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people argue
with you when they hear this?

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No.

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This chipper
person, this upbeat person

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.320 align:middle line:90%
talking about the afterlife?

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: No, most people
think it's a wonderful thing.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
refreshed by it.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I hear now-- sometimes I spend
all day answering questions.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.035 align:middle line:84%
People email me through
robertagrimes.com.

00:37:27.035 --> 00:37:29.118 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are their
biggest concerns, Roberta?

00:37:29.118 --> 00:37:31.580 align:middle line:90%
What do they want to know?

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Oh, so many things.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Many people I hear from now
are dissatisfied Christians.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And because I'm writing
more about the fact

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.600 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus is right, but
Christianity is wrong.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because of the
direction of religions,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.090 align:middle line:90%
organized religions?

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.792 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Christianity,
it went wrong

00:37:48.792 --> 00:37:51.330 align:middle line:84%
literally within a few
decades after Jesus' death.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And they just they think it's
a lifeline, because they do

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.280 align:middle line:90%
love Jesus.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.430 align:middle line:84%
They just don't
like the rest of it.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And I say guess what, you don't
have to have the rest of it.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give Jesus
the movement that he

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:90%
tried to begin 2000 years ago.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:07.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now, that's an
interesting thing you bring up.

00:38:07.032 --> 00:38:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Because when you die,
do you meet Jesus?

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Jesus is
probably reported

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:16.110 align:middle line:84%
as someone they meet almost
more often than anybody else.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.457 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is very active
in the afterlife.

00:38:18.457 --> 00:38:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What level?

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.430 align:middle line:90%
All levels?

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Well, yeah.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I believe, based on--
this is just a belief--

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe Jesus is at the
very top of the Godhead,

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.185 align:middle line:90%
and was when he came to earth.

00:38:28.185 --> 00:38:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
somebody be a level three,

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.842 align:middle line:84%
somebody else would
be at level four or 5?

00:38:32.842 --> 00:38:34.050 align:middle line:90%
And what's the highest level?

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:35.220 align:middle line:90%
What would you call it?

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, the highest
level is the source level.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would that be
called a seven, a 10.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yeah, seven.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A seven.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So why is somebody a
three and not a seven?

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Because people--
most of the people

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:52.990 align:middle line:84%
you know have a balance of
positive and negative emotions.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.520 align:middle line:90%
You know, they get angry still.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: They-- all of that.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.197 align:middle line:84%
When they die, they're
going to be at level three.

00:38:59.197 --> 00:39:00.280 align:middle line:90%
That's where most people--

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do they take
that anger with them?

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: They take
their inability

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.440 align:middle line:90%
to rise above it with them, yes.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't feel angry,
but they don't have yet

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.870 align:middle line:90%
this perfect peace that--

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know some people who
really shouldn't even be here.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.130 align:middle line:84%
They are-- they're, you know,
probably level six beings.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.340 align:middle line:90%
And they all are the same.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.190 align:middle line:84%
They all have this
peace about them.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:25.590 align:middle line:84%
They can't even be
around negative people.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing they care
about is serving others.

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.410 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just, oh, I'm
trying to get brownie points.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:31.950 align:middle line:90%
I want to serve.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:33.630 align:middle line:84%
No, that's all they
care about, really.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: And
that's how you grow.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.660 align:middle line:90%
You get past ego.

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.710 align:middle line:90%
Ego has to die.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:84%
You get past wanting any
kind of negative thing

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.410 align:middle line:90%
to happen to anyone.

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:49.380 align:middle line:84%
When you read the
Gospels, Jesus tells us

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:84%
how it feels to
be that advanced.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:56.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, you turn
the other cheek.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What level will you
be at when it's your time?

00:39:58.570 --> 00:39:59.945 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I think
that's-- to me,

00:39:59.945 --> 00:40:01.410 align:middle line:84%
that's a very
interesting question.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:03.370 align:middle line:90%
I've been told that I--

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd say it's high up.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: High up.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how high,
but you're up there.

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: No, I think
I'm high level four,

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.760 align:middle line:84%
or I'm even level
five, at this point.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.843 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you
understand the dying process?

00:40:13.843 --> 00:40:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: No, because I have
gone through what Jesus told us

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.750 align:middle line:84%
we need to do in order to bring
the Kingdom of God on Earth.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Not to plug a book, but my book,
"The Fun of Growing Forever,"

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.360 align:middle line:84%
gives us Jesus' lessons
and applies them for today.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:90%
I did those myself.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And it transformed me in
ways which I can't even

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.330 align:middle line:90%
begin to tell you.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:37.845 align:middle line:90%
I don't get angry anymore.

00:40:37.845 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to forgive,
because I just never

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.010 align:middle line:90%
get upset with anyone anymore.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.052 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you used to?

00:40:42.052 --> 00:40:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Oh, you
wouldn't believe.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.750 align:middle line:90%
I was-- I was a prima donna.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:48.860 align:middle line:90%
I was-- I was a lethal driver.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:49.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, don't--

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you a road rager?

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Oh, you
wouldn't believe.

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not you!

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.977 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Once I chased
a man off the highway,

00:40:54.977 --> 00:40:57.060 align:middle line:84%
because I was so irritated
that he had cut me off.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what were you going
to do if you caught up to him?

00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Well, that was the--

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.080 align:middle line:90%
that's the real problem.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.850 align:middle line:90%
I chased him through a park.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And then he started to
hit a police station.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I thought I ought to stop
chasing him at that point.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:07.170 align:middle line:90%
That's who I was.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if he had
gotten out and shot you?

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: You know, I
was young at the time,

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and let's say I was
just not thinking.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little naive?

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:16.620 align:middle line:90%
But I was angry.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what got
you out of that mode?

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:21.570 align:middle line:84%
What got you to stop
acting that way?

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: The real trick
is learning prevenient--

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.078 align:middle line:84%
what I call prevenient
forgiveness,

00:41:26.078 --> 00:41:28.620 align:middle line:84%
forgiving everything that's ever
going to happen in your life

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.750 align:middle line:90%
before it actually--

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:31.932 align:middle line:90%
anything actually happens.

00:41:31.932 --> 00:41:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you
forgive somebody

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:34.477 align:middle line:90%
who hurt a family member?

00:41:34.477 --> 00:41:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Of course.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could?

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Intentionally?

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody hurt
them intentionally?

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Murdered a child, yes.

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could forgive them?

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I couldn't
have done that before,

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.460 align:middle line:90%
but I can do it now.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can't.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean there's
something wrong with me?

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No, that just means--

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.610 align:middle line:84%
A Course in Miracles is
another more advanced way

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:53.660 align:middle line:90%
to learn the same thing.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.635 align:middle line:84%
And it begins by saying
this is a required course.

00:41:56.635 --> 00:41:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I could
forgive somebody

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.500 align:middle line:84%
who killed someone
in an accident,

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.110 align:middle line:90%
because it was an accident.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.580 align:middle line:84%
I could even
forgive somebody who

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:09.060 align:middle line:84%
killed someone while they were
drunk and got into an accident.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.457 align:middle line:84%
But a murderer, I
couldn't forgive.

00:42:12.457 --> 00:42:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: But here's the thing--

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:16.580 align:middle line:90%
none of this really is real.

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who is
harmed by someone--

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.330 align:middle line:90%
someone you love who's harmed--

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.630 align:middle line:90%
they're still fine.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see them in
like a minute and a half.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:25.620 align:middle line:90%
These lives are very short.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but
you still miss them.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.402 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: But the harm you
do to yourself by being angry

00:42:32.402 --> 00:42:34.610 align:middle line:84%
is a horrendous harm, because
you're keeping yourself

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:35.710 align:middle line:90%
from growing spiritually.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is your
Christianity upbringing

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:38.180 align:middle line:90%
coming out.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: No, it's
Jesus coming out.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I had-- I've totally
ditched Christianity.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.470 align:middle line:90%
It is not real.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:43.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's fear based,
which means that it's--

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:49.190 align:middle line:84%
anyone who is a seriously
practicing Christian

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:51.050 align:middle line:90%
can't grow spiritually.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We have to get rid
of Christianity,

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and let Jesus have his turn.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:43:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In this stage,
how many of us, if we die,

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.520 align:middle line:84%
come back to the
ones we care about?

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: To visit them?

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To visit them.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: It's
probably close to 100%.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly?

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.010 align:middle line:84%
They give us signs
in the beginning.

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody, if you
lose someone, be watching.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Familiar song on
the radio, penny

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't expect
to see there, feathers,

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:90%
insects of various kinds.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Although, the ones
they mostly give

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.920 align:middle line:84%
us are butterflies
and dragonflies.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Lots of signs.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.420 align:middle line:10%
That's my book, "The Fun
of Staying in Touch."

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.400 align:middle line:10%
And they do that
in the beginning.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And most people
will say, oh, look,

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I've seen dragonflies all
day, and, oh, one is on my--

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.000 align:middle line:84%
one is-- that's
just a coincidence.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.750 align:middle line:84%
You should never say
that's a coincidence.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I don't
believe in coincidences.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Well, that's good.

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:48.560 align:middle line:84%
See, you're ahead of
everybody else then.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think there's fate.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: The thing to do
is to say, thank you, dad.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Please do it again.

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:54.318 align:middle line:90%
In case it is a sign.

00:43:54.318 --> 00:43:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Because, if we give them
that kind-- and speaking

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.310 align:middle line:90%
aloud helps them energetically.

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Because we keep
encouraging signs,

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.730 align:middle line:90%
we'll get more and more of them.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long do we
stay in this state of bliss

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:06.250 align:middle line:90%
when we pass over?

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Eternally, because
there's no time there.

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.245 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:44:10.245 --> 00:44:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: If you--
usually, people

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:16.130 align:middle line:84%
will start to crave
growing more spiritually,

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and so they'll design
another lifetime.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:21.030 align:middle line:84%
But they usually spend
a lot of time there.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:25.517 align:middle line:84%
It's like R and R, after a very,
very rough period on Earth.

00:44:25.517 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:90%
But there's no time there.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't think
in terms of time.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Those who are trying to stay in
touch with loved ones on Earth

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:33.890 align:middle line:90%
will sort of be aware of time--

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:35.040 align:middle line:90%
you know, Earth time.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, they
don't care about time.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If family members
came up to you and said,

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.880 align:middle line:84%
my family just died, or my
family member just passed on,

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're grieving,
and they're upset,

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.250 align:middle line:90%
what do you tell them?

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Well, I don't.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.050 align:middle line:90%
I listen.

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:51.650 align:middle line:90%
I ask them, tell me--

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.010 align:middle line:90%
tell me what you need to know.

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:54.740 align:middle line:90%
How can I help you?

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:58.730 align:middle line:84%
I do work in, pretty quickly,
he or she is perfectly fine,

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:00.440 align:middle line:90%
and they're right here with us.

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're hoping that
you will find what you

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:03.860 align:middle line:90%
need to have peace about this.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.000 align:middle line:90%
You will see them again.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.020 align:middle line:90%
You'll hug.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything is going
to be wonderful.

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:09.570 align:middle line:90%
People want to hear that.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.480 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want
to hear, move on.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
hear anything negative.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's in
hell, or whatever,

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:16.830 align:middle line:90%
they don't want to hear that?

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.837 align:middle line:84%
No, that would be
really something

00:45:18.837 --> 00:45:20.630 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't want to hear.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to reincarnation
for just a moment.

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Do they all reincarnate?

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No, it's up to you.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's our choice?

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:30.105 align:middle line:90%
And why reincarnate then?

00:45:30.105 --> 00:45:30.905 align:middle line:90%
Why come back?

00:45:30.905 --> 00:45:32.697 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: So that you
can grow spiritually.

00:45:32.697 --> 00:45:35.270 align:middle line:84%
If you're there, it's like
being in a spiritual hammock.

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:36.660 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to push against.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you come
in, in a stage three,

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:41.210 align:middle line:90%
you're stuck in that level?

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Can you advance to a four,
five, six while you're there?

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: What we think the case
is, based on a lot of evidence,

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:52.850 align:middle line:84%
is that it's very difficult
to grow spiritually there.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Those who can't
stand coming to Earth

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.760 align:middle line:84%
will sometimes
volunteer to be a guide.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So they will get their Earth
experience guiding people

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.500 align:middle line:90%
through their lifetimes.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But that's something
which you can only

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.050 align:middle line:84%
do if you're pretty
advanced yourself,

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:14.090 align:middle line:84%
so they go through a lot of
periods of minimal sort of--

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's boring to
guide regular people,

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:20.810 align:middle line:84%
when you can't even do
much to help them yourself.

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:22.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the hard way
to grow spiritually.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.520 align:middle line:84%
The easy way is to go
to the spiritual gym.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.620 align:middle line:90%
You plan a workout here.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.720 align:middle line:84%
You strip down to a
small part of your mind.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.450 align:middle line:84%
You get on those machines--
death of a child, you know,

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:35.540 align:middle line:84%
horrible illness,
and you work out.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Because then you can
grow spiritually.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Renown medium,
James Van Praagh,

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.220 align:middle line:84%
who has a show on Gaia
called "Spirit Talk," talks

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.590 align:middle line:90%
about reincarnation.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.050 align:middle line:10%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: And it
seems that, as soul beings, when

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:50.060 align:middle line:10%
we get to the other side
of life, what happens

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.710 align:middle line:10%
is we meet with our guides.

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:54.260 align:middle line:10%
We meet with our spirit
teachers, our counselors.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.830 align:middle line:10%
And we really will sit down and
prepare for another lifetime.

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:00.140 align:middle line:10%
We will look in this
past life we just had

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.510 align:middle line:10%
and review it, and see
all the soul lessons

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:05.000 align:middle line:10%
that we learned, whether
those lessons might

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.050 align:middle line:10%
have been about forgiveness, or
compassion, or understanding.

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:11.690 align:middle line:10%
Or maybe there was also
some karmic obligations

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:14.660 align:middle line:10%
we had with another family
member, with a friend,

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:15.653 align:middle line:10%
with a partner.

00:47:15.653 --> 00:47:17.320 align:middle line:10%
We now know a little
about those, right?

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.690 align:middle line:10%
It's like, what's going on here?

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:19.530 align:middle line:10%
Jeez!

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:20.330 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:24.130 align:middle line:10%
So that's really-- we work these
things out in each lifetime.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:25.880 align:middle line:10%
So we'll sit with our
guides and teachers,

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.550 align:middle line:10%
and we'll really kind
of map out our agenda

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:29.930 align:middle line:10%
for the next lifetime.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.930 align:middle line:10%
And we'll put ourselves
in various situations,

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:35.180 align:middle line:10%
and certain events
will happen, in order

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.790 align:middle line:10%
for us to really
learn and to grow

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:42.110 align:middle line:10%
and be involved in that
experience about patience,

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:44.180 align:middle line:10%
or about forgiveness,
or about caring,

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.370 align:middle line:10%
or about loving yourself.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:48.260 align:middle line:10%
So reincarnation, you perfect.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.840 align:middle line:10%
You get better and better, and
you understand the lesson more

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:51.640 align:middle line:10%
and more.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.070 align:middle line:10%
And I think the more
experiences we have,

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:57.140 align:middle line:10%
the more evolved we become.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems, Roberta,
that more and more people,

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:03.950 align:middle line:84%
like yourself, like
Van Praagh, are really

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:07.040 align:middle line:90%
refreshed about the afterlife.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a very upbeat way.

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.910 align:middle line:90%
I was once afraid.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:12.700 align:middle line:84%
When I was very
young, I was afraid.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.450 align:middle line:84%
We all are in the
beginning, because we're

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:15.290 align:middle line:90%
afraid of the unknown.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, I
hope you're right.

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:17.440 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.070 align:middle line:90%
I want you to be right.

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:22.160 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a
great place to visit--

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: It is.

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --or to stay.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: The best part of
it is it's all made of love.

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.050 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
exists there is love.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you're
wrong, and it just ends?

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.250 align:middle line:90%
You die, it's over.

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:38.940 align:middle line:84%
You know what my
answer is to that?

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:39.740 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yeah, right, because
you wouldn't know anyway.

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You wouldn't know.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Right.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You wouldn't know.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Right.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.420 align:middle line:90%
No, that's how life starts.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.900 align:middle line:90%
You go home.

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.710 align:middle line:84%
You have a whole new
outlook on things

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:53.900 align:middle line:84%
if you've had a good lifetime,
you've grown spiritually.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.658 align:middle line:84%
You get to be with
your eternal friends.

00:48:55.658 --> 00:48:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- people might think,
I don't have any friends.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:59.033 align:middle line:90%
You have a lot of friends.

00:48:59.033 --> 00:49:00.705 align:middle line:84%
They just aren't in
bodies right now.

00:49:00.705 --> 00:49:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we
have a physical life

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:03.260 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: It's going
to the gym, This

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:08.600 align:middle line:84%
is where we come to experience
the negativity that gives us

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.650 align:middle line:90%
something to push against.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have free will,
because whatever the question

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.200 align:middle line:90%
is, love is always the answer.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But we will, instead,
make short term decisions,

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:22.100 align:middle line:90%
choose hatred, anger, fear--

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:26.750 align:middle line:84%
all those emotions--
which lower our vibration.

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:28.362 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So is this a school?

00:49:28.362 --> 00:49:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, people
think of it as a school,

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.862 align:middle line:84%
but I call it a gym, because we
really come here to workout--

00:49:33.862 --> 00:49:34.695 align:middle line:90%
workout spiritually.

00:49:34.695 --> 00:49:36.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we need trainers?

00:49:36.895 --> 00:49:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well,
we have trainers.

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:40.850 align:middle line:84%
We have our guides,
who are desperately

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:42.320 align:middle line:90%
eager to help us grow.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your best
friend is your guide.

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- to allow them to have
the opportunity to be a bigger

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:49.590 align:middle line:84%
part of your life
is a good thing.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:52.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you changing
the world, in your opinion?

00:49:52.145 --> 00:49:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I think
many people right now

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:54.728 align:middle line:90%
are changing the world.

00:49:54.728 --> 00:49:58.850 align:middle line:84%
You're doing a tremendous job of
changing the world just opening

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.140 align:middle line:90%
people's minds and hearts.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Because those who
are not in bodies,

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:05.540 align:middle line:84%
way above our pay
grade, are working

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.510 align:middle line:84%
to open the minds and
hearts of people on Earth.

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:11.720 align:middle line:84%
But if we aren't there to
help them, to guide them,

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:15.110 align:middle line:84%
to give them the
information they crave,

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:17.810 align:middle line:84%
there's a limit to what those
at the highest level can do.

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Our job is a very important one.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.160 align:middle line:84%
We're giving people the
truth and, as Jesus said,

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.342 align:middle line:90%
the truth will set you free.

00:50:23.342 --> 00:50:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the
day comes and you

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.250 align:middle line:84%
go to the other side, what's
it going to be like for you?

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: It's going to
the best time of my life.

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.200 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what happens?

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You really
believe that.

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:35.208 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I know it.

00:50:35.208 --> 00:50:36.500 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you-- I'll tell you--

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.510 align:middle line:84%
someone asked me, well, why are
you working so hard to do this,

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:40.100 align:middle line:90%
because I work day and night?

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.440 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I want the parade.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.810 align:middle line:84%
They didn't understand
what I was talking about.

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Those who have
given their lives,

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:52.550 align:middle line:84%
or a good part of their lives,
or just plain lived their lives

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:55.850 align:middle line:84%
in coordination with
spirit, in love,

00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:59.990 align:middle line:84%
doing little things for
people, get parades.

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When's the last
time you road raged?

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Probably
about a decade ago.

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That long?

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Are there times you're driving,
and you go [ANGRY GRUNT]??

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Never.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
even there anymore.

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:12.155 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: That's the thing.

00:51:12.155 --> 00:51:14.025 align:middle line:84%
The miracle of the
teachings of Jesus--

00:51:14.025 --> 00:51:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's probably
true of others,

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I just have been
following Jesus--

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:19.250 align:middle line:90%
the miracle is this--

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:22.040 align:middle line:84%
once you raise your
spiritual vibration,

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.730 align:middle line:84%
once you do the forgiveness
exercises correctly,

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:26.550 align:middle line:90%
you never go back.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you've done that?

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you seen
people, or individuals,

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that you knew you'd have
a hard time forgiving,

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.440 align:middle line:90%
but you still do?

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yeah,
what happens when

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.640 align:middle line:84%
you have gone to the
place where I am now

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.570 align:middle line:90%
is you simply withdraw.

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:43.523 align:middle line:90%
You don't argue.

00:51:43.523 --> 00:51:44.690 align:middle line:90%
If someone says stuff that--

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:45.908 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You just back down?

00:51:45.908 --> 00:51:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes, you withdraw.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.010 align:middle line:90%
You love them.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:53.630 align:middle line:84%
The exercise is I
love you, I bless you,

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I forgive, and I release.

00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:57.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's the exercise.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the afterlife take
on the image of anything you

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.730 align:middle line:90%
want, or is it already there?

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Our minds help
to create our reality.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, what if you
love the Rocky Mountains?

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Would you have a heaven, or
an existence in the afterlife,

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:14.480 align:middle line:90%
that looked like that?

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, we all actually,
who are in the North American

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.790 align:middle line:84%
continent, seem
to have the Rocky

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Mountains in the distance.

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:23.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you decided you wanted
to live at the foothills

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:23.900 align:middle line:90%
of the mountains, of course.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or a beach,
or something like that?

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes, yes.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.370 align:middle line:84%
People can decide they
want to be on a beach.

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:84%
They can decide they just
want to be on a big pond.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.620 align:middle line:84%
The great thing is the
water there is alive,

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:34.920 align:middle line:90%
which Jesus told us it is.

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.053 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: And it's made of silk.

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:38.335 align:middle line:90%
It's really not wet.

00:52:38.335 --> 00:52:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to be at
a blackjack table in Vegas

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.230 align:middle line:90%
getting blackjacks all the time.

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Can you make that happen for me?

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I-- to tell you
the truth, I'm not sure.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.900 align:middle line:90%
But the question is--

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
make it happen now?

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, that would
be even better, of course.

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure would.

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: But I wouldn't
be sitting here.

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:53.860 align:middle line:90%
I'd probably be doing it myself.

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:54.660 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:56.243 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, you
do have a few vices.

00:52:56.243 --> 00:52:58.860 align:middle line:90%


00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: The thing
is when we're there,

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're not sure-- you
know, it's all very new--

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.550 align:middle line:84%
suddenly we might start
to want something.

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:08.480 align:middle line:90%
A book.

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.790 align:middle line:90%
You know, a toy even.

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:10.590 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you get it?

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.892 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: You turn-- you
think, gee, I wish I had that.

00:53:13.892 --> 00:53:15.980 align:middle line:84%
You turn around, and
it's there in your house.

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
there waiting for you.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yep.

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you-- can you
have sex in the afterlife?

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Oh, yes.

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're kidding.

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: The only thing is
you don't really want it.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't even
know why I asked you that.

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, this is
an interesting question.

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Not only can you have sex
in the after-- most people

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:38.750 align:middle line:84%
don't want it, because
there's something way better

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:40.140 align:middle line:90%
that you can do with anybody.

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.040 align:middle line:90%
There's no morality attached.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's a kind of
spirit blending.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:50.950 align:middle line:84%
One person steps into the other,
and it's like having, they say,

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:51.963 align:middle line:90%
a whole body orgasm.

00:53:51.963 --> 00:53:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't reproduce
on the other side, obviously.

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: No, we don't
have organs to reproduce.

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But we do have
sexual organs, and we

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.070 align:middle line:90%
can complete the sexual act.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just, why do
that, if you could

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:05.110 align:middle line:84%
have an instant, ecstatic,
whole body orgasm?

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, be careful.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:08.300 align:middle line:90%
This is a family show, Roberta.

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, I'm just
telling you the way it is.

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:13.280 align:middle line:84%
We've known about this
spiritual blending

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.860 align:middle line:84%
thing, which is what
they do instead of sex,

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:16.940 align:middle line:90%
which is better than sex.

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:18.890 align:middle line:84%
We've known about that
for quite some time.

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:20.660 align:middle line:84%
One thing that's
new to me, though--

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I run something called
afterlifeforums.com.

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Other people do it,
but I own the website.

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: And we hear
from widows, who,

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:33.153 align:middle line:84%
over the past really
literally year, have started--

00:54:33.153 --> 00:54:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't say it.

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't say it.

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: They've started
to say they still have sex

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:40.040 align:middle line:90%
with their husbands who died.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.270 align:middle line:84%
They-- the husband will
show up in the bed.

00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:44.642 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They mentally
think this is happening?

00:54:44.642 --> 00:54:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, enough of
them are saying it happens,

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:48.308 align:middle line:84%
and insisting it
does, I'm starting

00:54:48.308 --> 00:54:50.540 align:middle line:90%
to think it probably does.

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.600 align:middle line:90%
The husband appears.

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.300 align:middle line:90%
They-- they do their thing.

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.020 align:middle line:90%
And then he goes away again.

00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My PG
rating for this show

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.300 align:middle line:90%
has just gone out the window.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: I'm sorry.

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, but I
think it's neat.

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Don't you think so?

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:06.340 align:middle line:90%
These very loving marriages.

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're very
happy about it.

00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:10.590 align:middle line:84%
They-- basically,
it keeps them happy

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:12.590 align:middle line:84%
that they are still
involved with their husband,

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:14.630 align:middle line:84%
until they get to be
with each other again.

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you've been
bad on this planet as a human,

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and you go to the
afterlife, you'll

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:22.860 align:middle line:84%
probably be stuck with like an
old hag, or something, right?

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No.

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's your punishment?

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No.

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:26.350 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:27.830 align:middle line:84%
If you've done
things here you have

00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:30.410 align:middle line:84%
trouble forgiving yourself
for, when you get to see--

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:34.500 align:middle line:84%
because we get to see how our
actions affected other people.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:35.945 align:middle line:84%
And if you did
things that really

00:55:35.945 --> 00:55:37.820 align:middle line:84%
made other people feel
horrible, and it never

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.708 align:middle line:84%
occurred to you that
that was the result,

00:55:39.708 --> 00:55:41.750 align:middle line:84%
it can be very hard to
forgive yourself for that.

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you come back and
help humans on the other side?

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yes, but it can--
sometimes you have to have some

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.570 align:middle line:90%
strings pulled, because--

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who pulls the strings?

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well,
very, very high--

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Way up, like the
archangels, people like that,

00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.520 align:middle line:90%
entities like that?

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yeah, may need to
approve what you want to do.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But if what you want
to do is not for you,

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:04.410 align:middle line:84%
but is purely for others,
you often can get to do it.

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:09.330 align:middle line:90%
That's a remarkable possibility.

00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:11.187 align:middle line:90%
It's all remarkable.

00:56:11.187 --> 00:56:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
sure you're right?

00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes, I am.

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:14.717 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have no doubts?

00:56:14.717 --> 00:56:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No.

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:16.953 align:middle line:90%
Not for a minute.

00:56:16.953 --> 00:56:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you ever?

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Oh, yes.

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:20.120 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I doubted--

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.250 align:middle line:10%
I'd say I first really
started to accept

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:24.890 align:middle line:10%
all of this at the same time
I gave up on Christianity,

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:26.905 align:middle line:10%
and that was late '90s.

00:56:26.905 --> 00:56:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
the one episode

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.620 align:middle line:90%
that made you give up on that?

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.780 align:middle line:84%
There had to have been
some thing that happened.

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I had
spent decades trying

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.690 align:middle line:84%
to find one bit of evidence
that anything I had believed

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:39.763 align:middle line:90%
as a Christian was true.

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
couldn't find it.

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: There was none.

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Except there were
a lot of people,

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:47.680 align:middle line:84%
who were then dead and knew
better, who said things like,

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I can't talk about
this, because I

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.050 align:middle line:90%
don't want to upset my family--

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: --but
none of it's real.

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:54.730 align:middle line:10%
There's no religion
practiced in the afterlife.

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:56.410 align:middle line:10%
We don't need to
practice a religion.

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:58.920 align:middle line:10%
Just as there are no atheists,
so there are no religionists.

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do they see
god in the afterlife?

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: There is
no physical god.

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:05.562 align:middle line:84%
The Christian god
does not exist.

00:57:05.562 --> 00:57:06.520 align:middle line:90%
What appears to exist--

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But there is a creator?

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: The creator,
like probably everybody

00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:15.510 align:middle line:84%
else who does major stuff
there, is a collective.

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
do you tell someone

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:19.188 align:middle line:90%
who is at the moment of death?

00:57:19.188 --> 00:57:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: I'm so happy for you.

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.920 align:middle line:90%
That's what I told my mother.

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I said-- I said, you have
no idea how I envy you.

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.070 align:middle line:90%
She didn't believe me.

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you one of a kind?

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: No, there are many
people who feel as I do.

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I have friends who say to
one another-- you know,

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:36.700 align:middle line:84%
husband and wife-- will
say, well, one day closer.

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:37.772 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:57:37.772 --> 00:57:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Roberta, thanks for
being on the program.

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Thank
you for having me.

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.238 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, so
you just heard it

00:57:42.238 --> 00:57:44.500 align:middle line:10%
from somebody who actually
is happy about going on

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.480 align:middle line:10%
to the other side.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.970 align:middle line:10%
I would like to wait
a little bit for me.

00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:51.070 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
