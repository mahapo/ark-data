>>GEORGE NOORY: He
is called Masati,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.810 align:middle line:10%
an expert in how
to use frequencies

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:10%
to raise human consciousness.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.780 align:middle line:10%
He was only 22 when he had his
first near-death experience.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:84%
His second NDE was 24
years later and then

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:84%
a third only a
couple of years ago.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.005 align:middle line:90%
Masati, welcome to the program.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: George,
Thanks for having me.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One near-death
experience is way too much.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Three?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Crazy, right?

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close did
you come to real death?

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:10%
>>MASATI: Well, all
three experiences,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:10%
I separated completely
from the physical form.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:10%
Most near-deaths, people peel
away, and then they come back.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.710 align:middle line:10%
But the first near-death,
more impactfully,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:10%
I saw my body hanging
in a warehouse accident.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
I saw my body hanging,
and I was 12 feet away,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
my consciousness, my
identity of who I was.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
on NDE number one?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: NDE number one,
it was a warehouse job.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And even before I get
into that, George,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I'd really like to
preface that people

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:84%
have near-death
experiences all the time.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:90%
A lot of documentations on NDEs.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:84%
But my near-deaths were
conscious near-deaths.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So before then, I was really
thirsty for understanding

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
what life was about, why we're
here, what the purpose of what

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:90%
life is about.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:90%
And I studied the religions.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And I studied the
success mechanisms,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:90%
making wealth and all that.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't quite
match because I

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:84%
saw people who were highly
religious and spiritual,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:90%
but they were still ill.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:90%
They still had problems.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I saw people who
were highly wealthy,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:90%
and they were still ill.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:90%
They had problems.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:90%
They aged like everybody else.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, that's
not the way Jesus

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.580 align:middle line:84%
or a Buddha or
Muhammad would do it.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to know what they
actually studied or practiced.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And, well, I found
out the answer.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And that led me to
my first near-death.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.680 align:middle line:90%
It was a warehouse accident.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:90%
I was 22 at the time.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:90%
It was a college job.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:90%
And I used to unload rail cars.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And in the rail cars,
they have these walls

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
that move back and forth to
keep the product in place.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:90%
And the wall was stuck.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was
climbed up, and I

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:90%
started pulling on the wall.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And this 1/2-ton wall gave way,
and it slid across the rails,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.565 align:middle line:90%
and it crushed my jaw.

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.362 align:middle line:90%
So I was hanging by my jaw.

00:02:51.362 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And in an instant,
I was separated,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
probably like 12 feet
away, from my body.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, wow,
that must really

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:84%
hurt because I could
see my neck all torted.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:90%
My body was over here.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:90%
My head was pulled over here.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, wow, that
must really, really hurt.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, well,
gosh, why doesn't it?

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:90%
And then that's when I realized.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, I'm dead.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a sad
experience, George.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:84%
It was just one of the
most beautiful experiences.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:90%
It sounds kind of weird, but--

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Beautiful?

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.905 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah.

00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Kind of crazy, right?

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Masati, how could a
near-death experience be fun?

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Well, it
wasn't fun physically,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
but you get to see the
potential of who we really

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:90%
could be physically, George.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And from my studies now,
over 100,000 client sessions

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and so on, you start to
see patterns in people.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And people are so limited
in their physical form.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So it was expansive to
me or more beautiful.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.747 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've heard hundreds
of stories of people going, god,

00:03:55.747 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:90%
it was the most beautiful thing.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.080 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to go back
or anything like that.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I was conscious,
and I'm going, oh, my god.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.950 align:middle line:84%
The possibilities of what
we have here physically,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.143 align:middle line:90%
it'd be amazing.

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it
was so beautiful.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:90%
It was so grand.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I always say that
physically, we're

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.920 align:middle line:84%
only living or tapping into
maybe 2% of what we could

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.040 align:middle line:84%
be here on earth, but the other
98% is just dying to come out,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:84%
just dying to fruition
in physical form.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So I was experiencing the
98% of who we are here,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's a beautiful
space, George.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they rush
you to the hospital?

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Well, that came later.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But through that
near-death, George,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:84%
it allowed me to
understand how time worked.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:90%
I had a life review.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I had a life review on why
things happened the way they do.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's like observing life
at a very high level and going,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm seeing
patterns in my life.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what frequency's
work is, understanding

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:90%
the patterns in your life.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a
beautiful moment.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:90%
And there's always a voice.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.818 align:middle line:84%
In all my near-deaths
that I've had,

00:05:06.818 --> 00:05:09.110 align:middle line:84%
there's always this beautiful
voice, George, that goes,

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you can stay here,
or you can go back.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they
say you can go back,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:84%
you go back into
physical form and--

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's your choice?

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.695 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: --into your body.

00:05:18.695 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not really a
choice, [LAUGHS]

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:84%
although they make you
feel like it's a choice.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And they is the beautiful--
if you want to call them

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.780 align:middle line:90%
angels or guides or whatever.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But there's a beautiful
group of people at any level

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:90%
that you exist in.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you go
through a life review?

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Yes, I went
through a life review.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I understood time,

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:84%
where I lived 22 years in my
life in just a few seconds.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So after I went through
the life review--

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like that?

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.882 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Just like that.

00:05:52.882 --> 00:05:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like you're
reviewing your life.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:84%
You experience life from birth
till that moment in full form.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's like reliving
your life complete.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
observing your life.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.360 align:middle line:84%
You are actually reliving
all those moments full form.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
seeing the things

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:84%
you did well, the
things you did badly?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You see everything?

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: You see everything.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.030 align:middle line:90%
You experience everything.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But you experience it from
an educated point of view.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Say, you go through
life, and most people

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:90%
are at a kindergarten level.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle line:84%
But this time you go
through the same experience,

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.360 align:middle line:84%
but you go through
it from a PhD level.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And you go, oh, that's why life
is the way that it should be.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why life is-- that's
why this happened to me.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So you start to see the
patterns on why things are.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you start
to remove your sense of, say,

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:84%
am I a good person
or a bad person?

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:90%
You're always a great person.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:84%
You just have bad experiences
or good experiences.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Experiences don't make you.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you learn things
about yourself in an NDE?

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Oh, absolutely.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:84%
You learn things about
yourself, not only yourself.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:90%
For me, I'm a little different.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I not only learn
things about myself

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and how beautiful the
possibilities of physical life

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
could be or life on the
other side, but then, George,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.490 align:middle line:84%
you also start to learn
things on how things operate,

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.490 align:middle line:84%
the physics of how this
reality is created,

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:90%
the physics of frequencies.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.682 align:middle line:90%
And that's really key.

00:07:23.682 --> 00:07:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How are
you learning this?

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.475 align:middle line:84%
Is somebody teaching you or
are they just perceptions?

00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: The
first one opened me

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:84%
up to concepts of how
time and space work.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:84%
It opened me up to
multi-dimensional realms.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Like in this dimension, you
could be playing a certain part.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, in this dimension,
you could be running--

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:90%
you could be having cancer.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.960 align:middle line:84%
In another dimension of self,
you could be fully healed.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's where you get into the
multi-dimensional possibilities

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:90%
of who you could be.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After you came back,
what changes did you encompass?

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.382 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: OK.

00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So just to answer
your question about

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:84%
did they rush me to
the hospital, they did.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I got from
the warehouse to the hospital.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:84%
My jaws were wired
shut when I woke up.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But about a week later,
everything was really clear.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:84%
I could still see the colors
that we don't see here.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.800 align:middle line:84%
There's different
colors, different sounds,

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:90%
different vibrations.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.809 align:middle line:90%
Flavors were more robust.

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I could see frequencies
behind people.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I could look at people
after my first near-death,

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'd go, oh, that
person has kidney issues.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.325 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that person has a headache.

00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:45.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Yeah, I could
start to see waves.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:10%
And it might sound
like psychic abilities,

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:10%
but it's very different,
although it sounds the same

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:10%
at the surface level.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:90%
So I started to see.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Or simple things like
somebody rings the phone.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Back then, we didn't
have caller ID.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, I
know who that is.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So your sense of intuition--
my sense of intuition

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:90%
really spiked up.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And I used that to, well,
have a successful business.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it make
you a better person?

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yes, it did.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But then at the same time, you
get really, really frustrated,

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:84%
George, because you get to see
a higher level of possibilities

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.330 align:middle line:84%
on how people could
be, how life could be,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.680 align:middle line:90%
and how reality could be.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
The strife that we go
through in this society,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:84%
in this reality as humans, it
doesn't have to be that way.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:84%
You see the perfection
of how it could

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
be at a much higher levels,
and you start to wonder.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, why
can't we do it here?

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So at that level, everything
makes perfect sense.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:84%
At this physical level, there's
always exceptions to the rule.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.820 align:middle line:84%
There's always, well, you
can do-- in this situation,

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:84%
it works here, but in this
situation, it doesn't work.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So those polarity or
duality in this reality,

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.710 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't function well.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to
have that, and that's

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.570 align:middle line:84%
why there's so
much, again, strife.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So you start to get,
well, a little angry.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
why can't I have

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.123 align:middle line:84%
the life that I know I can have
here in this physical reality?

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.665 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of people nowadays,

00:10:25.665 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:90%
George, are going through that.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I know that there's
a better way of doing life,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
being life, and it's
more than making money.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.820 align:middle line:84%
It's more than having kids,
and it's more than that.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about not
having those things.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:84%
It's about, how about
being a better individual

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:84%
to do that at higher
levels of consciousness?

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we can actually
radically change this reality.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 24 years later,
something else happened to you.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.642 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Well, that's just it,
like you were saying, George,

00:10:56.642 --> 00:11:00.575 align:middle line:90%
where life wasn't doing--

00:11:00.575 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:90%
I had great success.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I had a million-dollar
home, the yacht,

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and all the toys and everything,
but I wasn't really happy.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like a lot of
people who are--

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not happy?

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy, right?

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
everybody thinks about,

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.863 align:middle line:84%
is, hey, you have all that
success, but it's like,

00:11:17.863 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:90%
why aren't you happy?

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Because there's that
piece or that potential

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:90%
that is missing out.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, I
realize what that is.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And people sacrifice themselves
for the wealth that they have,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
the success that they have,
the beauty that they have.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's just it.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.870 align:middle line:84%
We sacrifice our best components
of who we are, George,

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:90%
our essence of who we are.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.870 align:middle line:84%
We sacrifice that aspect of
us to have a physical, say,

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:90%
abundance.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
But in this case
and what I teach now

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.420 align:middle line:84%
is, well, why can't
you have both?

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Why can't you expand who
you are and understand

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.330 align:middle line:84%
who you are, and
then wealth becomes

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:90%
a reflection of who you are?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not like empty
wealth or empty success.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's really key.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:84%
People are massively
successful, but they're

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
just as poor as anybody
else deep inside.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what happened
with NDE number two?

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: NDE number
two, we were in Belize.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:84%
It was a fascinating
experience, again.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And I know it sounds crazy,
near-death, but in this case--

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You sound like look
forward to these things.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Not anymore.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I've learned enough.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's enough?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: That's enough.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I'd like to
talk about that as well.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
But the second
NDE, George, really

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:84%
helped me understand--
well, let me back up a bit.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:41.310 align:middle line:84%
The second NDE
happened in my 44--

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And it was in Belize.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.360 align:middle line:90%
It was a rafting experience.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.230 align:middle line:90%
And it was quite amazing.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.810 align:middle line:84%
We were in the
jungles of Belize.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.175 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the universe
really knew what was happening,

00:12:53.175 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and the universe does know
what's happening all the time.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does know.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.285 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: It's crazy.

00:12:57.285 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.940 align:middle line:90%
There was bird noises.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:84%
There was wind and all
the sounds of the jungle.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And when we got into the water--

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and it was my wife at
the time and my kids,

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.080 align:middle line:90%
my three kids at the time.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's like
everything went quiet.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:90%
There was no wind.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.150 align:middle line:90%
There was no sound.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:90%
It was like a movie set, George.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.920 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what's happening?

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:90%
It was so profound.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:84%
I guess the quietness
was so loud.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, what is going on?

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And we got into the water,
and it was fast rapids.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:90%
And my family went one way.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I got stuck into a
tributary, and this is where

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:90%
I got sucked into a cenote--

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:84%
a hole in the
bottom of the river.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.827 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:13:49.827 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: I got sucked
out of my inner tube.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have my life jacket on.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A pull-down current?

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yep.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And I got sucked into
the bowels of the earth.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And I try to climb out,
but the water pressure--

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.798 align:middle line:84%
just think it's a hole this
big and so much water going in.

00:14:06.798 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You couldn't swim
hard enough to get up there.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, I tried to push
against the wall.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And my fingernails were
bloody, my back was bloody.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.060 align:middle line:90%
After I got out, I noticed that.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:90%
But it's like you give up.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And as I gave up, that
same euphoric feeling

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.700 align:middle line:84%
that I had in my first
near-death, where it's like, oh,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
my god, here we go again.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was so beautiful
because, again, my essence,

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.640 align:middle line:90%
my consciousness was here.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And I could see my body
floating or going deeper

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.330 align:middle line:90%
into the darkness of the tunnel.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
I saw my body leave.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And then my consciousness,
my presence of who we are--

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:84%
or some people might
call it your spirit--

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I transcended through the
rock, through the freshness

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:90%
of the water.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I could still feel
it on my presence,

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.980 align:middle line:84%
although I didn't
have a physical form.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I went into
the higher realms.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.310 align:middle line:84%
This is where people might
talk about the tunnel of light.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I transcended or graduated
through the tunnel of light

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and went beyond the veil,
beyond the curtains.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And I started to see the
mechanics on how realities work,

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.920 align:middle line:90%
how time and space function.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And I went way beyond
that, too, George.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
at spirit level,

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:84%
you still have an
identity of physical form.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But spirit doesn't even
have physical form.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:90%
So you go beyond that.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.165 align:middle line:84%
You go beyond your
identity of being human.

00:15:36.165 --> 00:15:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And at that level,
there's no time.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:90%
There's no space.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you have access
to the infinite intelligence

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
that was, is, and shall
be because everything

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:90%
all happens all at once.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who pulled
you out of this?

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Well, at that level--
that's a beautiful question--

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:90%
a divine hand.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I guess somebody
loves me up there.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:90%
It's like it went blank.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So once I understood
or got the education

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
that I connected to at
that level, I blacked out.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, I found myself

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.300 align:middle line:90%
about 100 yards above river.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:84%
The inner tube was still getting
sucked in, but it was too big.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.350 align:middle line:84%
It's too large to get
sucked into the hole.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going,
how the heaven did

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I get above river if I
got sucked down there?

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.160 align:middle line:90%
So divine intervention.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can--

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
funny you say that.

00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I had a call on my radio
show years ago from a fellow

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:84%
who said he was swimming in
the ocean 200 or 300 offshore.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.830 align:middle line:84%
His friends were on the
beach, laughing and drinking

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.630 align:middle line:90%
and having a good time.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:55.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, a current pulled me
under, and I was gone, George.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:90%
I was going to drown.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:84%
I saw a hand reach down into
the water and pulled me out.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:84%
And as I lunged out to grasp the
air, gasp it, I looked around.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.040 align:middle line:90%
There was nobody there.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Same thing happened to you.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Exactly.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:84%
It's literally like I
felt somebody pull me

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:84%
from the back of my neck, just
grabbed me and just pulled me

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:90%
And then I blacked out.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I found myself on
the river, and I'm going, wow.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was not your time.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: It was not my time.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's beautiful
people or a consciousness

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.700 align:middle line:84%
up there always
watching over us.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.200 align:middle line:84%
No matter how dark
we think our life is

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:84%
or how bright our
life is, there's

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:84%
always people observing,
watching, taking care of you.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.470 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do is
to connect to those.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At that point, did the
two NDEs change who you were?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Oh, yeah, quite a bit.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:84%
The first one allowed me,
again, gifts of intuition.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:84%
I was always intuitive,
but this heightened it.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:90%
The second NDE, again, gave me--

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:84%
the second NDE allowed
me to really understand

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:90%
the concepts of life.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I got pulled
into deep-state meditations

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I'd wake up at 2:00,
3:00, 4:00 in the morning,

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.757 align:middle line:84%
and that same voice would go,
hey, it's time to meditate.

00:18:19.757 --> 00:18:20.590 align:middle line:90%
And I'd look around.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:90%
I was like, who is that?

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Who's in my bedroom?

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
I'll do it later.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it's like,
no, you need to do it now.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, OK.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So I would wake up at
2:00, 3:00 in the morning,

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and I would do this
stand-up meditation.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.740 align:middle line:84%
This is what I teach
some of my classes now.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And I would be there for
three, four, five hours just

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.810 align:middle line:84%
standing, which gives you
a different consciousness

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
be aware of your body

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.480 align:middle line:84%
so you can't float away,
which is important.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But it allows you to expand
into the consciousness

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:84%
of the near-death
experience in physical form.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And in those
experiences, George,

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
this is where I learned
how time and space work,

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:84%
how realities work, why we go
through what we go through.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most
difficult questions

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:84%
that we have here
in this reality

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't figured
out, those solutions

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
or those possibilities
or those answers

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.140 align:middle line:90%
came to me through those.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So that was my education on how
to help people nowadays the way

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A couple of years
ago you had a third NDE.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: So with each--

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:84%
think of near-death experiences
as psychedelic experiences

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
because people use psychedelic
experiences to go from, say,

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:90%
a level--

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:84%
for clarity, say, we're at
level 0, zero-point frequencies,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.830 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we go to, say,
level 10 consciousness

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:90%
with a psychedelic experience.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, a near-death for
me, conscious near-death,

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
takes me to a level 100
consciousness, for example.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big jump.

00:19:57.735 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah, big jump.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:90%
And then you stay at that level.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:84%
The key is, how do you
stay at that level?

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the second near-death
went from consciousness 100

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
to maybe consciousness
400 or 500.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
near-death was just recent,

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
about a year or so ago,
probably almost two years ago.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was the most
difficult because this

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.270 align:middle line:90%
is where my whole body stopped.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And the third
near-death, George,

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:31.150 align:middle line:84%
really allowed me to recreate
my body in a younger form.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm 63 right now, but--
it took me a while,

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have the same
issues as my family does.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.115 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the heart issues,
the diabetes, the arthritis,

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and everything else that
my family's going through.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're pretty healthy.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:90%
You're pretty healthy.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.065 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: I'm very healthy.

00:20:45.065 --> 00:20:47.046 align:middle line:90%
At 63, I look--

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:50.993 align:middle line:84%
my lab results and so on
are like of a late 20s--

00:20:50.993 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: --early 30s.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.935 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what happened?

00:20:53.935 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Well, this
is where, again,

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:84%
the concepts of
time and space can

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
be skewed to help
us age differently.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:06.220 align:middle line:84%
This is where we can, say,
massively transform who we are.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.920 align:middle line:84%
This is how we
re-evaluate or redefine

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
what honor is, what love
is, what abundance is,

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:84%
what creativity is, what help
is, what being a good person is.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
We redefine it from,
say, a god's definition

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.440 align:middle line:84%
or that intelligence
that runs this reality.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:90%
So you access that level.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:34.010 align:middle line:84%
You're not accessing human, say,
definitions of all those things.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:84%
You access a very, very
different definition.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.262 align:middle line:84%
And, well, you get
different results.

00:21:38.262 --> 00:21:40.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how did
you die the third time?

00:21:40.095 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Oh, in the third
time, we were in Peru in Machu--

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:90%
not Machu Picchu.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Ollantaytambo.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:90%
I have some land there.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.540 align:middle line:90%
And it could be the elevation.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
COVID at the time.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:84%
It was just a
couple of years ago.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.880 align:middle line:84%
My whole system,
like my potassium,

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:84%
all my minerals were so depleted
that basically my body stopped.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a heart attack,
but my whole muscular system

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.620 align:middle line:90%
stopped.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sorry.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.568 align:middle line:10%
>>MASATI: Yeah, and
my son, at the time,

00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:17.860 align:middle line:10%
he was in the hospital with me.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:10%
And he was holding--

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:10%
just praying for me.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And I separated.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And I could see, again,
above, looking at him,

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:90%
holding my body down.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:90%
And I just blanked out.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I went
into a beautiful realm

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:84%
with just beautiful people
there, beautiful beings,

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:90%
I should say.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:45.753 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up feeling much,
much better than when I came in.

00:22:45.753 --> 00:22:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They sent you back?

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Yeah,
they sent me back.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:84%
That was the hardest because
it took me about a year

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.850 align:middle line:90%
to reclaim my body.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:23:00.380 align:middle line:84%
But to reset your whole
body to a younger age,

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.010 align:middle line:84%
not just physical features, but
the essence of being a younger

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.980 align:middle line:84%
person, and going back in
time, resetting your heart,

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:84%
literally restructuring
your heart and your organs

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.665 align:middle line:84%
to be a younger person,
it takes a little time.

00:23:13.665 --> 00:23:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
a couple of pictures

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:18.750 align:middle line:84%
of what you used to look like
compared to what you look like.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And the difference
is astounding.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:22.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yes.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:10%
So you can see the difference.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.992 align:middle line:10%
And obviously, it's--

00:23:26.992 --> 00:23:28.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You got younger.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:10%
>>MASATI: I got younger.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.798 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, that one
looks like my uncle.

00:23:30.798 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] But obviously,
the love of a good woman,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:10%
obviously, that
does well as well.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.900 align:middle line:10%
But the techniques--
and this isn't just me,

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.740 align:middle line:10%
but look at the-- it's like
two very different people.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:10%
The essence of who
we actually are

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:10%
comes out on the 2021 picture.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But you can see it's not
just like the physicalness,

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:84%
you look physically healthy,
but the presence and the essence

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:90%
is more of a timeless being.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Quite amazing.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you
do to look younger?

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Well,
the frequency work.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:90%
It's usually frequency work.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.770 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, along
with frequency work,

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.600 align:middle line:90%
diet, exercising.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Everybody does the
diet and exercise,

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
but the difference
is the frequency

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:84%
that you resonate at because
people age the way they do.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.640 align:middle line:90%
You're 60 years old.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Your genetics or your
DNA goes, OK, at 60,

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.700 align:middle line:90%
people have these diseases.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Your mom or dad had
this issue at 60.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:40.430 align:middle line:84%
We'll just recreate it in
this life for this person.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But in my case, with what
we do, with the techniques

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.750 align:middle line:84%
that I teach people, you
can go, well, Mom had that,

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.580 align:middle line:90%
but I don't need to have that.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Dad had heart issues.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to have
heart issues, and so on.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So we start to delete
all those patterns

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.150 align:middle line:90%
that we really don't need.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
you get younger.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And your trueness, your vibrancy
of who you are, shows through.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Basically, your
essence, your spirit,

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.820 align:middle line:84%
literally starts
to show through.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's the huge difference.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you
assist and help people?

00:25:11.895 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Absolutely.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
try to do for them?

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.328 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: What do I do?

00:25:15.328 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, it's not mental
or psychology or anything

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what I see,
George, is, again,

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:26.040 align:middle line:84%
the multi-dimensional
realm or the matrix.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:84%
What I do is, oh,
you're creating yourself

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.280 align:middle line:84%
in this reality,
and this reality

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:90%
dictates that you're tormented.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Or no matter how
much money you make,

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.040 align:middle line:90%
it'll never be enough for you.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Or if you make a
lot of money, you'll

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:84%
lose it or any other
patterns that you run.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Or you have heart issues
or whatever it might be.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:52.280 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, but there's
a dimension out here

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:90%
that is better for you.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:84%
This dimension, you can actually
enjoy the money that you have.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.520 align:middle line:84%
You can actually create,
say, better health for you.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.500 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to experience a
life of heart attacks or heart

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.710 align:middle line:90%
issues and so on.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:90%
And you get amazing results.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So I point out the possibilities
of what they could be.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't create it for them.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.090 align:middle line:84%
But everybody has
better possibilities

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:90%
that they're not using.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:90%
So I point that out.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's point B. And I
go, but where are you now?

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Because most people don't
really understand why

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.367 align:middle line:90%
they are where they are.

00:26:26.367 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how they got there.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: And how
they got there.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.490 align:middle line:84%
They always think
of the effects,

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:36.800 align:middle line:84%
but I go to the cause of why
they got to where they are.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
do that, you've

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.845 align:middle line:84%
got point A. Just
like Google Maps,

00:26:40.845 --> 00:26:43.930 align:middle line:84%
it's like, you want to go to
point B wherever point B is,

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.730 align:middle line:90%
a better version of you?

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Where are you now?

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Most people, like you said, they
don't know how they got there.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
why they got there.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.930 align:middle line:84%
They just know that
they want out of there.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:58.480 align:middle line:84%
But like Google Maps,
you have to define really

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:04.460 align:middle line:84%
well exactly what point of
time and space you are in.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And then once you know
those coordinates,

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:84%
you can go to point
B. It's like, oh,

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:84%
let me show you how to
go to point B. So again,

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I map out where they want
to go, where they are,

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and then guide them to that
direction frequency-wise

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.810 align:middle line:90%
by changing their--

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it take the
near-death experiences to get

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
you to that point?

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Well, I've had enough,
George, for plenty of people.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
had way too many.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So people don't have to go
through a near-death experience

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.940 align:middle line:90%
to go through that.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.450 align:middle line:84%
It is a near-death
experience for people

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that go through the process
because your old self has

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to die, but you
physically don't have

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.590 align:middle line:90%
to have a near-death experience.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.210 align:middle line:84%
You just have to let
go of your old self

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:90%
so your new self can blossom.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.296 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
help other people today?

00:27:53.296 --> 00:27:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Oh.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, the things
I can do in, say,

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.272 align:middle line:84%
a 10-minute session or
even in my group sessions,

00:28:01.272 --> 00:28:03.480 align:middle line:84%
hyper-meditations, where
they don't even have to have

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.140 align:middle line:84%
a one-on-one with me, that can
massively transform people,

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
decades worth of therapy
in, say, 10, 15 minutes.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Especially for young kids,
they can massively transform,

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:22.480 align:middle line:84%
kids who have ADD, ADHD, or
even like suicidal patterns,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.810 align:middle line:90%
depression and so on.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:28.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand how to
render or create themselves

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:29.990 align:middle line:90%
in space and time.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the after
effects is what

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:84%
we call ADD or ADHD or any
of those other diseases

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.780 align:middle line:84%
that we've labeled
these young kids with.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.920 align:middle line:84%
But once you center
them, once you

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.080 align:middle line:84%
help them understand
where they are--

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and I know it sounds crazy, but
my concept is, George, you--

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.936 align:middle line:84%
There is a superintelligence
that created you

00:28:55.936 --> 00:28:57.890 align:middle line:90%
before you even had a brain.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's tap into that
superintelligence

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and change you here versus
changing you at a mental level.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's the profound, say,
transformations that people

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.940 align:middle line:90%
receive from my work.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's all frequency work.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.042 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you use
technology to help you?

00:29:16.042 --> 00:29:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Well, this is really,
really advanced technology.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:24.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I help quantum
computers work better.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.470 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Well,
quantum computers

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:84%
are in a realm where
they use electrons.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much you
know about quantum computers,

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.700 align:middle line:90%
but bits are either a 1 or 2.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:90%
So they have two bits.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:84%
In quantum computers,
they call it qubits.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.355 align:middle line:84%
And one bit is either a 1 or
2, depending on, say, the state

00:29:46.355 --> 00:29:47.155 align:middle line:90%
that it's in.

00:29:47.155 --> 00:29:50.000 align:middle line:90%


00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's in superposition.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.864 align:middle line:84%
It could be two
positions at one time.

00:29:54.864 --> 00:29:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with quantum
computers is stability.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
people is stability.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's not stability of
the mind or the stability found

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.980 align:middle line:84%
by people thinking to make
more money or through love.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the stability
of consciousness.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the stability
of time and space.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.280 align:middle line:90%
And we can do that.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Just like quantum computers,
you stabilize that electron.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:21.030 align:middle line:90%
And then it comes out more--

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.890 align:middle line:90%
it outputs better.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.540 align:middle line:90%
It's more coherent.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:84%
It stays in coherent
states, easier, faster.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:32.020 align:middle line:84%
You get better answers,
more accurate answers.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.180 align:middle line:84%
People are just like
quantum computers.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.480 align:middle line:90%
To me, there's no difference.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.640 align:middle line:90%
We're just programs.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
effect of my work,

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.270 align:middle line:84%
by the way, when you can
adjust quantum computers

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.050 align:middle line:90%
at the frequency level.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
say you're a healer?

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: I wouldn't
call myself a healer,

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:84%
or I wouldn't say I
cure people in any way.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.570 align:middle line:84%
However, people get
massive transformations.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.780 align:middle line:90%
They do cure themselves of--

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even stage
IV cancers and stuff.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Again, I don't claim
to cure anybody,

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
but I do claim
that I am probably

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.470 align:middle line:84%
the expert at awakening
people's possibilities of what

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:11.270 align:middle line:90%
they could be.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.812 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You assist
them to give them

00:31:12.812 --> 00:31:14.360 align:middle line:90%
the ability to do these things?

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yes.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.470 align:middle line:84%
You have your own
natural healing ability

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:84%
that's died down
through media and how

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.340 align:middle line:90%
we've been raised and so on.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I awaken that
possibility, the autonomy

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.890 align:middle line:84%
of who we are, the
possibilities of who we are.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And once you awaken them,
people heal themselves.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us an example
of somebody who came to you

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:90%
and what you did for them.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Sure.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I can give you a
ton of examples.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.510 align:middle line:90%
They're on the website.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:84%
But he's a good friend of mine
now, again, highly successful.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.910 align:middle line:84%
They gave him eight months to
live because of heart issues

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:50.880 align:middle line:90%
that he had.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So a friend of mine that
I've gone through-- he's

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:53.940 align:middle line:90%
a good friend.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Again, most of my clients
become really good friends.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:84%
But he's like, you got
to talk to this guy.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And he was very hesitant
because high-level CEO.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.330 align:middle line:84%
He's gone through the best
doctors, best whatevers

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.330 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody's
done anything for him?

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Nobody's
done anything for him.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.190 align:middle line:90%
And he's got hesitant.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:15.660 align:middle line:90%
I was like, hey.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.700 align:middle line:90%
So I talked to him.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.940 align:middle line:90%
And it was awkward.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.850 align:middle line:90%
It was like, OK.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.903 align:middle line:84%
So in that telephone
conversation there,

00:32:21.903 --> 00:32:23.570 align:middle line:84%
it was like-- and he
didn't even tell me

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:84%
he had heart issues
because I can scan people.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the key gifts I have,

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:33.540 align:middle line:84%
is I can tell people
exactly where they are,

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:37.140 align:middle line:84%
what issues they have, and what
the cause of those issues are.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.700 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
key components.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So I told him right off
the bat, just to go, oh,

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:42.510 align:middle line:90%
you've got heart issues.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And I can see how his lung and
how his heart were working,

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.862 align:middle line:90%
not the most efficient way.

00:32:52.862 --> 00:32:54.570 align:middle line:84%
He was like, yeah,
how did you know that?

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, I can
see everything in people.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's what his scans and
his tests through medical scans

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.800 align:middle line:90%
and so on--

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And how one ventricle
wasn't working as well,

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:08.430 align:middle line:90%
I can see all that.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, gosh.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:15.660 align:middle line:84%
He gained trust in that
because nobody can tell.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can see that, but I can.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: His daughter
had heart issues.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And they were
going to actually--

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.020 align:middle line:84%
they were waiting for
a heart transplant.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.160 align:middle line:84%
His daughter had
five heart surgeries.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.810 align:middle line:90%
By that age, she was 10.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:90%
I met her at 20.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And in about five, six months,
he went back to the Mayo Clinic,

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.706 align:middle line:84%
and they gave him a
clean bill of health.

00:33:40.706 --> 00:33:41.506 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:33:41.506 --> 00:33:42.306 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah.

00:33:42.306 --> 00:33:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And his daughter doesn't need
a heart transplant anymore.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And that might sound extreme,
but those are actually

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.140 align:middle line:90%
normal cases.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.678 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we have a video
of Steve that you worked with.

00:33:54.678 --> 00:33:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a little bit about him.

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.000 align:middle line:90%
So Steve, I met him--

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.030 align:middle line:90%
he was a young kid.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:84%
He was 29 at the time,
probably, about 29,

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:09.469 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of addictions, a lot
of probably abuse in the family,

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:11.510 align:middle line:90%
like a lot of kids go through.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And their out would be,
well, I'll take drugs

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:90%
because people want to escape.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:19.701 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, even
now, people are

00:34:19.701 --> 00:34:21.409 align:middle line:84%
trying to do psychedelics
because they're

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:90%
trying to escape.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.909 align:middle line:84%
It's OK, but we
need to understand

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:27.360 align:middle line:90%
the power of psychedelics.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.130 align:middle line:90%
So unlike Steve here--

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.050 align:middle line:84%
he tried more drugs,
more drugs, more drugs

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.973 align:middle line:90%
because it's euphoric.

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:84%
It's literally a death
experience for people.

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, they're
not conscious of that death

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.422 align:middle line:84%
experience, so it
doesn't benefit them.

00:34:43.422 --> 00:34:47.929 align:middle line:84%
It's like a downward spiral
for people who do psychedelics

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:51.320 align:middle line:84%
or-- because nowadays,
it's the rage nowadays.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So for Steve, he
took way too many,

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.920 align:middle line:90%
got more distorted than ever.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.760 align:middle line:90%
And he found me.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how he found me,
probably through a friend.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.960 align:middle line:90%
And through the course--

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and he had heavy addictions.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And throughout the
course, not too long,

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:17.760 align:middle line:84%
a lot faster than going
through a clinic or a center,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.590 align:middle line:90%
totally redefined who he is.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Plus, he had a chance to
heal his nervous system.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.097 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing turnaround.

00:35:26.097 --> 00:35:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's take
a look at what Steve has

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.875 align:middle line:90%
to say about working with you.

00:35:29.875 --> 00:35:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Oh, thank you.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.890 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVE: I used to be
addicted to heroin, cocaine.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:10%
Pretty much nothing
in my life was good,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.780 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't understand
what was going on.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.950 align:middle line:10%
It's been a crazy
journey healing

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:10%
my brain and my nervous system
from all the drugs that I did.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.240 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't have thought
it was possible.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.140 align:middle line:10%
I didn't even really
know how bad it was.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.110 align:middle line:10%
And then all of
the drugs started

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.760 align:middle line:10%
coming out of my
system, which I didn't

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.010 align:middle line:10%
realize they were still there.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.810 align:middle line:10%
It had been years since I'd
stopped doing drugs when I first

00:35:58.810 --> 00:35:59.960 align:middle line:10%
started working with you.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.033 align:middle line:10%
Really understanding
how to be here--

00:36:02.033 --> 00:36:04.075 align:middle line:10%
like I said, I was in so
many different realities

00:36:04.075 --> 00:36:09.582 align:middle line:10%
and time frames that I never
really even experienced my body.

00:36:09.582 --> 00:36:11.290 align:middle line:10%
And that's why it was
so difficult for me

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.240 align:middle line:10%
to gain any traction in life.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.130 align:middle line:10%
Things have changed
massively for me.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:19.060 align:middle line:10%
I actually feel myself
here, experience life.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.910 align:middle line:10%
My relationships
are all amazing.

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:24.320 align:middle line:10%
I was even living
with my parents

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.590 align:middle line:10%
when I first started working
with you, and I was 29.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.720 align:middle line:10%
So many significant changes.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.480 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, now I have
amazing relationships.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:10%
Literally, life,
it's like a system.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.640 align:middle line:10%
All my relationships,
all my experiences,

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.920 align:middle line:10%
everything is working
together to really create

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:10%
the best possible
situation for my evolution.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.080 align:middle line:10%
So it's really beautiful.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does what you
do for these people compare

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.530 align:middle line:84%
to traditional
medicine, for example?

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Traditional
medicine is really fantastic.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But whether it's traditional
medicine or Eastern/Western

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:05.250 align:middle line:84%
medicine or self-improvement
or anything else that we do,

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.820 align:middle line:90%
again, they treat the effect.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.160 align:middle line:90%
I treat the cause.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So Steve's issues go
back to genetic patterns,

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.980 align:middle line:90%
familial patterns of abuse.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And Steve was not the
first one that had

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.590 align:middle line:90%
addiction issues in his family.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:24.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's not the issues of Steve.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.150 align:middle line:90%
It's the issues back here.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So through the work
that I did, it's

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:84%
like, OK, let's clean out
those genetic patterns.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's clean out the frequency
behind those genetic patterns.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, he
radically changed.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.720 align:middle line:90%
His health radically changed.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.600 align:middle line:90%
He's very, very different.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
an example on how

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.170 align:middle line:84%
you can tell the difference
between mental change

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:51.380 align:middle line:84%
or just physical betterment
and then frequency change.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So in this situation,
Western medicine

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
or Eastern philosophies,
it doesn't really matter.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.890 align:middle line:90%
They work at the effect level.

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:02.840 align:middle line:90%
I work at the cause level.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.050 align:middle line:84%
You combine the two, and
it really accents those.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So I help a ton
of people who are

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.540 align:middle line:84%
going through therapies, cancer
therapies, or even psychology

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.340 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a lot of psychologists
actually take my healing courses

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:18.370 align:middle line:84%
on how to be better
psychologists or

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:20.950 align:middle line:84%
even how to be better
surgeons because it's

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:24.500 align:middle line:84%
the essence of the person that
helps the client or the patient

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:90%
heal better.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What percent
of the patients

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:31.135 align:middle line:84%
do you reach in terms of being
able to accomplish something?

00:38:31.135 --> 00:38:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Oh, I have
very high success levels.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:90%
I thought so

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Yeah.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:45.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what I do is so new
that the mainstream will go,

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.340 align:middle line:90%
no, that's woo-woo out there.

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.800 align:middle line:90%
But it's the latest science.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.082 align:middle line:84%
Science is always crazy
until it becomes the norm.

00:38:53.082 --> 00:38:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, these
are last-ditch efforts.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:39:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, like my friend, the
CEO, went to all the greatest

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:03.560 align:middle line:90%
specialist clinics.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.330 align:middle line:90%
They tried the latest things.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:06.960 align:middle line:90%
It happens all the time.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK,
what's the last ditch?

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's like they
hear about me.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So even those extreme levels,
we can turn people around.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, I can't
guarantee anything.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.730 align:middle line:84%
It's all up to the
person's essence.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.870 align:middle line:90%
But absolutely, they transform.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:24.260 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's in the
high 90s, I would say.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: It's huge.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: It's huge.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.353 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you tap
into that higher dimension

00:39:29.353 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness for them?

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Well, for them,
I actually teach them.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.170 align:middle line:90%
I love these questions, George.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for them.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So most modalities, even
self-improvement or other

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:45.704 align:middle line:84%
techniques that are
out there that--

00:39:45.704 --> 00:39:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm pushed into the energy,
but I go beyond energy.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I go to the origin of energies
or the origin of frequencies.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So what I do, it's like
a tuning fork, George.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like they're over here.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:02.000 align:middle line:84%
They're tuned at a different
resonance or frequency.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000 align:middle line:90%
And I go, you know what?

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.380 align:middle line:90%
You need to resonate here.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And I start to help them
rewire their frequencies,

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:10.320 align:middle line:84%
again, not their brain,
but their frequencies.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not the state of mind
that changes your life.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the state of
your frequency.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, you're
resonating in this frequency.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's resonate you at this.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So I literally help guide them
into the higher frequencies.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So I create a tuning
fork experience for them,

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:29.290 align:middle line:84%
where it's like, hey, you're
supposed to resonate at this.

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.850 align:middle line:90%
And then they tune--

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I help them tune themselves
to a higher frequency.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And once they get to
that higher frequency,

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:84%
they start to go, oh, I don't
need this, or I don't need that.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.987 align:middle line:90%
They can shed it away.

00:40:41.987 --> 00:40:44.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When do you know
they've reached that level?

00:40:44.195 --> 00:40:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Oh, you can
see it in their presence.

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.380 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in
their essence, George.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.470 align:middle line:90%
They light up.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I worked on this young
girl the other day.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:02.010 align:middle line:84%
She was bound by the burdens of
her parents and her grandmother.

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And she was only 23,
and she looked so old.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And I only worked with
her for 5, 10 minutes.

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And 10 minutes
later, I look at her,

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and she's just a nice bright
23-year-old, her essence,

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:15.310 align:middle line:90%
her energy.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:17.040 align:middle line:90%
You can just tell.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.180 align:middle line:90%
People can sense the difference.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.195 align:middle line:90%
They might not know.

00:41:21.195 --> 00:41:22.570 align:middle line:84%
If I worked on
you-- and I'd love

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.670 align:middle line:84%
to work on you, by
the way, George.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do I need work?

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Well, we can
always ascend higher.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:29.510 align:middle line:90%
We can always expand better.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.500 align:middle line:84%
We can always age better
and all that, of course.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's just connecting
you to your higher self.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But people start to really
sense what their real purpose is

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.390 align:middle line:90%
about here.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And once they feel their
real purpose of what it is,

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:47.600 align:middle line:90%
everything becomes more joyous.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
real healing comes

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.408 align:middle line:90%
through or real transformation.

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:52.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is
dramatic, isn't it?

00:41:52.825 --> 00:41:56.664 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Oh, it's
totally dramatic.

00:41:56.664 --> 00:41:59.092 align:middle line:90%
It's so different.

00:41:59.092 --> 00:42:01.256 align:middle line:84%
There's people that
make a lot of money,

00:42:01.256 --> 00:42:06.040 align:middle line:84%
but I help them create
a very different source

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:10.660 align:middle line:84%
because their value comes from
within, not the possessions

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.750 align:middle line:90%
that they have.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it get
emotional for you sometimes?

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: It actually
does with young people

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.270 align:middle line:90%
because they're so brilliant.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:22.250 align:middle line:90%
They have so many possibilities.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And you see the burdens
that they carry.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.200 align:middle line:90%
And they release them.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you see them
a year or two later.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they do the
courses and all that,

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.730 align:middle line:84%
or their parents help
them do the courses.

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's from point A to
point B, and they come

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and they come so vibrant,
and they're just so happy.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.478 align:middle line:90%
George, it's the best thing.

00:42:42.478 --> 00:42:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like watching
your kids grow up.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.070 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is
believing they can do this?

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MASATI: Oh, not
important at all.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Not important at all.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are very
skeptical from this.

00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:02.910 align:middle line:84%
But I bypass their brain because
skepticism is in the brain.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I access, again, the
natural conditioning

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:09.110 align:middle line:84%
of how our genetics work or
how our frequencies work,

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.390 align:middle line:84%
the way nature
intended you to be.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Once you connect them to
that level, belief systems,

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:19.130 align:middle line:84%
they get to see the proof within
a very short period of time.

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So they really
don't need belief.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, sometimes
people who are--

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.695 align:middle line:84%
they could be skeptic,
but they could be--

00:43:26.695 --> 00:43:27.920 align:middle line:90%
it works if they're open.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.580 align:middle line:90%


00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So once they start to see
the structure, they go, oh.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's good to be
questioning that process.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.760 align:middle line:84%
It's always good to be
questioning the process,

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.780 align:middle line:90%
rather than, yep, I believe it.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:42.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to jump in.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Because those people
get taken advantage of

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and all that stuff by
other healers and all that.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:52.635 align:middle line:84%
So you want to have
healthy skepticism.

00:43:52.635 --> 00:43:53.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what I say.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And that way, you
start to understand

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.265 align:middle line:90%
the logic of what I do.

00:43:57.265 --> 00:43:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And then it makes
sense for them.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think you were
chosen by higher-ups to do this?

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Wow.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:09.730 align:middle line:10%
Gosh, I can't really say, but
I think we choose ourselves

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:13.052 align:middle line:10%
by resonating at a certain
frequency, I think.

00:44:13.052 --> 00:44:14.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you?

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.010 align:middle line:10%
>>MASATI: The best way is the
thexicode.com, the, T-H-E,

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:20.950 align:middle line:10%
xicode.com.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:24.830 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of YouTube
videos on the meanings of life,

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:28.450 align:middle line:10%
why life happens the way it is,
and what you can do about it.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's, again, that XI Code.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Or you can go to Masati,
M-A-S-A-T-I .live.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's my YouTube channel.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And, again, there's a lot
of free coursework on that.

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And it explains not just
coursework or just topics,

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.740 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot
of hyper-meditations

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that literally transform
you as you listen to me.

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Masati, thanks
for being on Beyond Belief.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MASATI: Thank you.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.380 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure, my friend.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:44:56.255 --> 00:44:59.500 align:middle line:84%
It took three near-death
experiences to change him

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and his life, but he now
changes other people's.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.850 align:middle line:90%
