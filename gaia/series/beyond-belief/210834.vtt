>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.080 align:middle line:10%
Freddy Silva with us-- a
bestselling author and leading

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.140 align:middle line:10%
researcher of ancient
civilizations,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:10%
restricted history, sacred
sites and their interaction

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:10%
with consciousness.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:10%
He's here to discuss his latest
work called "Scotland's Hidden

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.160 align:middle line:10%
Sacred Past."

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:10%
Freddy, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY SILVA:
Hello, again, George.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.450 align:middle line:90%
It's like having family, again.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why the
interest in Scotland?

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: In Scotland, it's
because of the subtitles.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.890 align:middle line:10%
Because there's so
little known about it.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:10%
It's a mystery in itself.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.255 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
it geographically,

00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:84%
you think that
civilization would

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:90%
have moved up from Europe--

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:84%
through France and
then through Britain

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.430 align:middle line:90%
all the way up to Scotland.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.220 align:middle line:90%
You would think so.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.928 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: It turns out
that-- it turns out

00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:01.120 align:middle line:10%
that the whole thing began
at the top of Scotland,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:10%
on the islands,
no less, and then

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:10%
it kind of threaded
down towards Ireland

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:10%
and then it kind of impregnated
the rest of the landmass.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So that for me
was a big red flag

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.192 align:middle line:84%
that something else
was going on here.

00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that what
they built there--

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.900 align:middle line:84%
there's over 300
temples, stone circles,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
some of the most beautiful
things in Britain--

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:84%
they were not native
to the territory.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
They came from
very, very far away.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was
hardly anything that

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:84%
was known about the
people who put them there

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:84%
or the reason why
they were built.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So I figured, I think that's a
good making for a good mystery

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.832 align:middle line:90%
so here we go, again.

00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
been to Scotland?

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, many, many times,
it's like a second home.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You like it?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Love it.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Can't get enough, especially
the curmudgeonly people

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:90%
who live on the islands--

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:84%
people who live with fog and
dense rain all the time--

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.933 align:middle line:84%
and they don't really sort
of foreigners of any kind,

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
but once you get
to know them, you

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:90%
can trust them with your life.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.978 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mel Gibson
played the part

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:55.492 align:middle line:90%
of William Wallace, a Scot.

00:01:55.492 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And he
had good hair, too.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, he did.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Was that a realistic portrayal?

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's pretty
good, actually.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.555 align:middle line:84%
Apart the fact, he's
a very good actor.

00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:05.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a very good portrayal.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was a real heretic
in the real sense of the word.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is Scotland magical?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Absolutely,
beyond a doubt.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of
the most magical parts

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:90%
of the world because of the--

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.655 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --inheritance
of information

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
that they have at
their disposal.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the language itself
is based on Armenian, which

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
is one of the oldest
languages in the world, which

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:90%
is a big surprise to me.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, if you just read
the Declaration of Arbroath,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:84%
which is the de facto
Declaration of the Independence

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:84%
of Scotland, they actually
talk about their origins

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:84%
as coming from the
land of Scythia, which

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:84%
used to be the region around
the Black Sea, which eventually

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:90%
went back to Armenia.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't a long
shot from that,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
but very few people
actually know that.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So when you have your foundation
as one of the oldest languages

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
in the world with very
ancient traditions,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.880 align:middle line:84%
then you really can't
go wrong from there.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Geographically,
how big is it--

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Scotland?

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.597 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, Scotland, I'd say,
is about the size of Vermont.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Not very big at all.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.347 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not very big.

00:03:02.347 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But before the
last sea level rise,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:90%
which is about 3000 BC--

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:84%
sea levels went
up about 24 feet--

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
if you include the islands,
some of the islands

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:84%
were actually mini-continents
in themselves.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So it formed a much
bigger landmass.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 2,400 feet took
a lot of shoreline away.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's a
lot of shoreline.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And in some places,
some of the islands,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:84%
you could be forwardable all
the way back to the mainland,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
but it was also one of
the last places in Britain

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.630 align:middle line:90%
that was covered with ice.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So it makes a lot of sense
that civilization began

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:84%
on the islands and
it slowly makes

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:84%
its way inward because it was,
obviously, not very hospitable.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How independent is
the country or is it still

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:84%
truly part of the
United Kingdom, too?

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They're not.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.620 align:middle line:84%
When you cross the
border Into Scotland,

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.390 align:middle line:84%
they're a completely
different people--

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
fantastic sense of
humor and you definitely

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:84%
feel, just like in
Cornwall or Wales,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.478 align:middle line:84%
that these people are
genetically and historically

00:03:51.478 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:90%
and culturally different.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And I, for one,
actually agree that they

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:84%
should have their own
border with the English.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I'll probably get a few enemies
and few hate emails from this,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:90%
but it's actually very true.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think it adds
to sort of the color

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:84%
of the country or the
whole region, if you like.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like going into
a foreign country

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:90%
without having a passport.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So I, for one, am
very supportive

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.470 align:middle line:84%
of the Scottish right
to self-determination.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As we travel
through the region,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and I'll have you explain
to us these various areas

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and their significance,
for example,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
Scotland's megalithic past.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yes.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How dramatic was that?

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.783 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That is "beyond
belief," to coin the phrase.

00:04:30.783 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect name.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.580 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: We have, for example,
on the island of Orkney,

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:10%
Britain's tallest megaliths--

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:10%
19 and 1/2 feet tall--

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:10%
which, by the way, is a
very consistent length

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.637 align:middle line:10%
for megaliths around
the British Isles,

00:04:42.637 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:10%
as though someone was
reading from the same manual

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:10%
all the time--

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.960 align:middle line:10%
and they're still in
perfect condition.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:10%
There's a stone circle
called the Ring of Brodgar--

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:10%
lovely names-- still
virtually intact

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:10%
because hardly anyone has ever
gone up there and also because

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:10%
in places like
the Isle of Lewis,

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:10%
with their Stone
Circle of Calanais,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:10%
it was all preserved
by the peat.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:10%
So when people left the islands
during a climate change,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.730 align:middle line:10%
3,000 years ago, the
peat begins to rise up,

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:10%
it covers the stones in no time
at all, and the local people

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle line:10%
who stayed behind--

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:10%
very few of them-- they
would then cut the peat.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:84%
They would stick it up
in these little pyramids.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.860 align:middle line:84%
They would make
it dry and that's

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:90%
what they use today for heating.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So they thought they had a
nice little series of stones

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
until they cut away the
peat and little by little,

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:84%
they began to realize, oh,
those towns are pretty big.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
were able to preserve,

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:84%
by their natural inclination,
the very essence of what

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:90%
these monuments are all about.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have some of the
best preserved monuments

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
in the British Isles, in the
extreme part of the British

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Isles, and that's what
makes it very magical.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go to an
island called Staffa.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Staffa.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is so unusual
about that and the belt

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:90%
of Orion out there?

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, my God.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:84%
If you have the stomach
for it, even on a nice day,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
taking a little
fishing boat out there,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:84%
the sea is very
shallow so you're

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:84%
going to get bounced around
like a bouncing ball.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.700 align:middle line:10%
And Staffa's a very tiny island.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a
series of organ pipes

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:10%
that suddenly got
thrust out of the ocean.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's all of these
octagonal basalt blocks

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and they literally
look like organ piles.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they look man-made?

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.163 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No, no, no.

00:06:15.163 --> 00:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
It looks man-made, it looks like
a machine, but it's all the--

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:84%
it's the thrust of magma
that came out of the ocean.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the second
oldest rock on Earth.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And when that hot magma made of
a certain crystalline structure

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:84%
hits the cold
water, it literally

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
solidifies in these
octagonal shapes.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.280 align:middle line:10%
So you're walking around what
look like organ pipes and it

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:10%
has three caves--

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:10%
two large, one small.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:10%
The main one's
called Fingal's Cave.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:10%
There's a whole
mythology about it.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out
that the guy that

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.800 align:middle line:10%
was based around
this mythology, a guy

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:10%
called Fingal or
Fionn man Cumhaill--

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:10%
if you want to get
into the brogue, which

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.540 align:middle line:10%
is really hard to
pronounce-- it turns out,

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:10%
he's the guardian
into the other world.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And all of these guardians
in the other world,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.320 align:middle line:84%
like Osiris before
him in Egypt, they

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:90%
were associated with Orion.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And one day when I'm
standing there, I'm thinking,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:84%
that's interesting because the
story of this benevolent giant

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.220 align:middle line:84%
who was white-skinned,
which back then was very

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:84%
unusual for that area because
people were darker skinned,

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.630 align:middle line:90%
so he stood out.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So the myth is kind of telling
about someone who lived there

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that appear to have used these
caves for a certain initiation.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So one of these days, I was
looking at the three caves

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.382 align:middle line:84%
and since the stories of
Finn and the people that

00:07:27.382 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
work with the other
world, they're always

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:84%
connected with Orion, I
figured, what if it's possible

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that they chose a specific
island, out of all the others,

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.780 align:middle line:84%
to do a ritual landscape
where the caves themselves

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.700 align:middle line:84%
are aligned to the
belt stars of Orion?

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Just like in Egypt.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit of computer
work, it didn't take that long.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I stood on top of Staffa
with the three cavers

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:90%
in front of me.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, if you
look at the horizon,

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
the first time that
the belt of Orion

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.320 align:middle line:84%
rises above the horizon on
the winter solstice in about

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:90%
3200 BC matches the--

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:90%

>>SILVA: Oh, yes.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.388 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a
look at one of your trips

00:08:10.388 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:90%
to an island of Mull.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ooh.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:90%
[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:10%
All manner of mystics
made their way to Mull

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.970 align:middle line:10%
to find a bond with their god.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:10%
Particularly women, who always
found a safe haven here--

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.770 align:middle line:10%
for example, the Church
of the Nine Holy Maidens

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:10%
or the Hill of the Virgins,
and Island Nimban--

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.870 align:middle line:10%
the Island of Women.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And men like Kenick Dalan--

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:84%
a sixth century Celtic monk
with family ties to the Druids

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and possibly, the
mythical rulers of island

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:90%
the Tuatha Dé Danann.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Kenick built a chapel
beside a ring of trees

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
marking what can only be
described as a vortex.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.130 align:middle line:84%
The kind of energy
hotspot sought by mystics

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.740 align:middle line:90%
for shamanic travel.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:84%
It may explain
why the monk chose

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:84%
to build a chapel far
from any congregation

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:90%
and in the middle of nowhere.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Oh, he wasn't the only one drawn
to this remote corner of Mull.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Around the 14th century,
there's another group

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.900 align:middle line:84%
of mystics practicing
ancient systems of knowledge

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
and they made their way
here and created the home

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were the Knights
Templar, who, in a Brotherhood,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.710 align:middle line:84%
behave like a
ministerial college.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
They built a cubic
tower, inside which

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
lies a restricted chamber used
for an out of body ritual.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Whereby, the initiates
were described

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.000 align:middle line:90%
as "raised from the dead."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And just like megalithic
temple builders before them,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:84%
the Templars, too, aligned
their temple to the stars.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.380 align:middle line:90%
[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.370 align:middle line:84%
The tower is placed at the
exotic angle of 51 degrees.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.330 align:middle line:84%
The same angle of slope of
the Great Pyramid of Giza

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and the number associated with
Seshat, the Egyptian goddess

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:90%
of sacred buildings.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Its Northeast wall faces
the summer solstice,

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:84%
the highest position
of the light

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and symbolic of the
attainment of wisdom.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Its southeast wall marks the
winter solstice, as well as

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
the rising of Cygnus, the
constellation of the Swan--

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:23.560 align:middle line:84%
symbol of the divine feminine
in the era of the Templars.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Eastern
corner of the building

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:84%
aligns to the rising of Venus on
the spring equinox, the symbol

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:90%
of the risen initiate.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.997 align:middle line:84%
It also references Orion
on the winter solstice.

00:10:35.997 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: He looks just like me.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have a chat
with my agent about this.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.118 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he looks a little
better than you, actually.

00:10:42.118 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.183 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You're just
saying that to hurt me.

00:10:45.183 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old
are those structures

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.540 align:middle line:90%
we just saw in that portion?

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Those
are fairly recent.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.270 align:middle line:84%
They're about 12th
century, 13th century.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.307 align:middle line:84%
The Templars built
something on, perhaps,

00:10:54.307 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:84%
something that was there
originally because that was not

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.678 align:middle line:90%
unusual for them.

00:10:57.678 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:84%
They do it everywhere
else in Europe.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:84%
They're always protecting a site
of extreme antiquity, usually

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.440 align:middle line:90%
dedicated to a female deity.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.940 align:middle line:84%
In Portugal, for
example, they would

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:84%
protect sites connected to
Isis or her local doppelganger.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But here, they actually built
it on a very strange location.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:84%
It was a sort of
outcrop of rock right

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:84%
next to the ocean with a
fresh water way around it,

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:84%
which means that if anybody
tried to raid the building

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:84%
or lay siege to it, the people
would be inside the building.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:84%
except that all they had
to do is stay outside

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.760 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of weeks
and you had no drinking

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:84%
water because the salt goes
into the actual drinking

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.800 align:middle line:84%
water from the ocean
and you die of thirst.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big chamber
right underneath it,

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:84%
which archaeologists say, well,
that was obviously, a well,

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
but there's no way for
water to go in there.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So the only other reason
why they built that chamber

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
was to have this
experience of leaving

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:84%
the body, which they did in
other places around Europe.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And that was also consistent
with other practices

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
of similar sects that
did the same thing.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:84%
When you reach a certain
level of initiation

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:84%
within the Brotherhood,
on the third year,

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:90%
you'd be given a narcotic.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.978 align:middle line:84%
You'd be put into this box or
a chamber below the ground,

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.145 align:middle line:84%
like you're going into the
womb of the Earth Mother.

00:12:11.145 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.638 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And then, you leave
the body for three days.

00:12:13.638 --> 00:12:15.960 align:middle line:84%
You come back three
days later completely

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:84%
aware of where you've just
been, not like a dream state.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:84%
So you've actually,
physically left the body.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they had
out-of-body experiences.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: An induced near-death
experience, to come of it.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.348 align:middle line:84%
So it's a practice that goes
back to Japan in 8000 BC.

00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:30.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they induce that with?

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:33.177 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: With poison, a
very well-timed poison,

00:12:33.177 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:90%
because you get it wrong--

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.718 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You get
a little too much.

00:12:35.718 --> 00:12:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, that was my
point is how did they practice?

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.433 align:middle line:84%
Do you start off at 15% and
you go, well, he's dead.

00:12:41.433 --> 00:12:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Bring in the next candidate.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's lower it.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:44.997 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: A little bit lower.

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:45.797 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's dead.

00:12:45.797 --> 00:12:47.964 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It would have been
hard to put your hand up

00:12:47.964 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:84%
to volunteer, but
that's how they did it.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it was done in
the Middle East and Near East.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Even in North America, in 1890,
Native Americans up in Michigan

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.360 align:middle line:90%
were still doing that.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And three
days later, you

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.660 align:middle line:84%
come back into the
body completely groggy,

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:84%
but you're totally aware
of where you've been

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and all the information that
you've gathered while you've

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:90%
been in the other world.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.570 align:middle line:90%
And when you leave the body--

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
so when you come back into the
body, you are declared risen

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:90%
or you are declared alive.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.940 align:middle line:84%
That's where the concept of
living Resurrection comes from.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.577 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem to have a
lot of knowledge of astronomy.

00:13:17.577 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, very much so.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they?

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very much so.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It was all to do with the
ancient concept of "as above

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle line:90%
so below."

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors were
very much aware

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is alive
and the planets and the stars

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:90%
even more so.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So to bring the energy of
a specific constellation

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.580 align:middle line:84%
or a specific planet,
which they understood

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:84%
to hold a certain
frequency, was to bestow

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:84%
onto a certain point on
the Earth, the frequency

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and the energy consistent
with that body.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you were trying to build
a temple to, say, knowledge,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.980 align:middle line:84%
you would connect with the
star Sirius or the Pleiades,

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
which is consistent
with every culture.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Orion is also very consistent
in this story, as well.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars were borrowing
from a very old manual when

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.145 align:middle line:90%
they aligned their buildings.

00:13:59.145 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:84%
To then, give the
little nod to anyone

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.605 align:middle line:84%
that was walking
by, if they look

00:14:02.605 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
at the alignment of
the buildings, that

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:84%
say the people that
live here know something

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:84%
that we shouldn't talk
about in public because back

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
then, the church would have
killed you on the spot.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So it was a way to
do a little nod and a wink

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
to people who did know
about alignments because it

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
was a secret communication,
a secret language.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And they were following
already, a very old tradition

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:22.930 align:middle line:90%
in the area.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.347 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
Templars, were they

00:14:24.347 --> 00:14:27.270 align:middle line:84%
the same guardians of the
Shroud of Turin-- the same ones?

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think there's
a different group there.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.100 align:middle line:90%
But I really do believe--

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was Michael
Bagian, I think it was,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a very interesting
book about the Shroud,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:84%
basing on the fact that
it's the image of Jacques

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:84%
de Molay, which is one of
the last Templar masters--

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not Jesus.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.232 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --that has a very
close resemblance facially--

00:14:47.232 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To Jesus.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --and to the way that
he was actually positioned.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are the
Tuatha Dé Danann?

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.345 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Ah, now we're
getting to the deep territory.

00:14:56.345 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How'd I
do on that name?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very good.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.362 align:middle line:84%
You can't pronounce
Gaelic very easily.

00:15:01.362 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
If you can master that,
you're already halfway there.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.778 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You trained me well.

00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Tuatha Dé Danann.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:06.780 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who are they?

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They are a very
interesting people who

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.390 align:middle line:84%
were mythologized by the
incoming Catholic Church

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and they were turned into
fairy folk, little people, very

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.570 align:middle line:84%
annoying because they wanted
to get the Irish people away

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:23.640 align:middle line:84%
from eulogizing and following
this ancient race of people who

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.020 align:middle line:90%
follow the divine bloodline.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And I followed the trail
all the way across Europe.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.650 align:middle line:90%
So in about 3000 to 5000 BC--

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:90%
not sure about the timing--

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
they arrive on the
coast of Ireland

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:90%
as the Tuatha Dé Danann.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:90%
They were very tall--

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:84%
unusual for the region
despite the fact,

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.120 align:middle line:84%
we have Norwegians
not far away--

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:84%
very light-skinned,
blond, blue-eyed,

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and they stood out like a sore
thumb from everybody else.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And they were said to be
part of a divine bloodline.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.318 align:middle line:84%
And they were
totally understanding

00:15:50.318 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:84%
about mathematics, astronomy,
the movements of the planets,

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and how these things
influence the being.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And they also carried a
very ancient tradition

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:84%
of mysticism, which led to
the development of the self

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual body.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So I traced them all the way
back through France all the way

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.228 align:middle line:90%
through Europe through Denmark.

00:16:08.228 --> 00:16:10.145 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they go to
a place called Scythia.

00:16:10.145 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the biggest
kingdoms in Syria--

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scythia.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --in about 5,000 years
ago around Bulgaria, Romania,

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Ukraine, and, what
was then, Armenia--

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:84%
one of the oldest
places on Earth.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So that was all
Scythian territory.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And there, they are
called the Tuath Dé Danu.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So as language moves
geographically,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.130 align:middle line:90%
it changes with the--

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.838 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Changes with
the dialect-- yeah.

00:16:31.838 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So Tuatha Dé Danu were
part of a divine bloodline who

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:90%
were half human, half divine.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.512 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they still around?

00:16:37.512 --> 00:16:39.262 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They are now
the Tuatha Dé Danann

00:16:39.262 --> 00:16:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're also part of
the Scandinavian race,

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.972 align:middle line:90%
the Caucasian race.

00:16:42.972 --> 00:16:43.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:16:43.805 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Of course,
it's very diffused now.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:45.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Extremely.

00:16:45.965 --> 00:16:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's
completely diffused.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.258 align:middle line:84%
We're talking thousands
of years of development

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
because before that,
you trace them back

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.570 align:middle line:84%
to the Armenian Highlands
and they are your friends

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and mine-- the people of Anu,
also known as the Anunnaki.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.177 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they giants?

00:16:58.177 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were 8 and
1/2 feet tall apparently,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:84%
according to the Egyptians
who are also part

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.322 align:middle line:90%
of that same race, as well.

00:17:04.322 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually written
on one of the temple walls.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.599 align:middle line:90%
I believe, it's at Edfu.

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a specific height
of 8 and 1/2 feet, which

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.550 align:middle line:84%
is about the height
of the skeletons

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
that we find in
the giant's graves

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.520 align:middle line:90%
throughout Great Britain.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy, who
are and were the Druids?

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The Druids were
very interesting people.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Druids-- I hope I'm not
offending any Gaelic people

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:90%
here-- the Druids.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, you're doing great.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:90%
Better than me.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: A couple of
pints of Guinness,

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:84%
you can speak
Gaelic very easily.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they were-- the
name originally translated,

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:84%
there's been a lot of
argument about this.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
I found one of the oldest
translations of the name.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.773 align:middle line:84%
It means to bring
into the circle.

00:17:41.773 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:84%
They were part of
a mystical group

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.668 align:middle line:84%
of people that held a
certain secret circle, just

00:17:45.668 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:84%
like the Templars
and everybody else.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good people?

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Evil people?

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, very good people.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.890 align:middle line:84%
They were protectors
of ancient mysticism

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:84%
that leads to the development
of the spiritual self.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wrong with that at all.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they
dressed in white robes.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:84%
They, again, understood
the stars, mathematics.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.818 align:middle line:84%
Julius Caesar was absolutely
frightened by them

00:18:03.818 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%

>>NOORY: Why frightened?

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because they
could do things and, like,

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
change the weather and
frighten the hell out

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:90%

>>SILVA: Completely
change the weather just

00:18:14.862 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:84%
by using the power of intent,
focusing it, and making

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:90%
the Romans run away.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.038 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Julius Caesar had
a problem recruiting people

00:18:22.038 --> 00:18:24.080 align:middle line:84%
to go and fight the Druids
when they were finally

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:90%
holed up in Wales.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.125 align:middle line:84%
Even the women joined
the Druids and said,

00:18:28.125 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:84%
"we're going to get
rid of the Romans."

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And for several
centuries, the Romans

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:90%
could go nowhere near them.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:84%
They frighten the
hell out of them.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that they learned

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:84%
was to use the power
of sound to paralyze

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.350 align:middle line:90%
the Romans during battle.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So they're just-- it's
like the Japanese,

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.758 align:middle line:84%
like the samurai, with
that sound that they do.

00:18:43.758 --> 00:18:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [MAKING SAMURAI SOUND]

the atmospheric barometer
pressure of your blood.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And when it does
that, it induces

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
sort of a catatonic
fear in your opponents.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:90%
That's why they do that.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.172 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So it gives
you just a few seconds

00:18:57.172 --> 00:18:58.745 align:middle line:84%
before the Romans
finally woke up

00:18:58.745 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and they realized that
they're actually being

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.560 align:middle line:90%
hit upon by arrows and swords.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly, it's all
about the power of intent

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:90%
and how to manipulate nature.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They understood

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.143 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one thing that
connects all these people.

00:19:11.143 --> 00:19:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Their technology literally
was understanding

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.118 align:middle line:84%
the laws of nature,
harnessing the nature,

00:19:16.118 --> 00:19:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and then bending the rules
within the rules themselves,

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
turned them into gods.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy,
what was so unusual

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.590 align:middle line:90%
about the island of Iona?

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, the fact
that 60 kings and queens

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:84%
are buried there on an
island 3 miles by 1.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:90%
It's suspicious.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 60 kings and queens?

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.110 align:middle line:90%

Oh, yes.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wanted
to be buried there.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why on that island?

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Another one of those
little mysteries.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
It's been sacred as
long as we can remember.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And the original name Hiona
is an Armenian phrase,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:53.573 align:middle line:84%
which means the "Island of the
Noble Clan of Armenian People"

00:19:53.573 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
or, if you look it from
another point of view,

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
the Island of the
Noble Clan of Orion."

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, that's
very interesting.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:10%
The place where
you have the Abbey

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:10%
at the moment-- the
famous Abbey of Iona--

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle line:10%
they're used to be a stone
circle with 360 stones.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.620 align:middle line:84%
The whole place is one
great big energetic hotspot.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And ever since we've known
the island's history,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:84%
people have gone there to do
all kinds of interesting things

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
to do with energy manipulation,
moving the laws of physics,

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and literally, establishing
groups who are very ecumenical.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.750 align:middle line:90%
The women were allowed there.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:84%
They had equal
footing as the men.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And everybody got
along just fine.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:90%
The Druids were there, as well.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.897 align:middle line:90%
The Caldi moved there in 35 AD.

00:20:33.897 --> 00:20:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seems like the
in place to be, huh?

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: A very good
place to be because it's

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.270 align:middle line:10%
about the rock and the
energy of the rock.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:10%
It's mostly red granite--

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:10%
one of the most
powerful rock on Earth.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of quartz, a lot of
iron, a lot of magnetite,

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.943 align:middle line:84%
and it's the same elements
that you find in a human body.

00:20:47.943 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's as though, you're
standing on the rock

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:90%
version of the human body.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So they're allowed to do
all kinds of mystical things

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.458 align:middle line:84%
in that island free
from, well, free

00:20:56.458 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:90%
from the English for one thing.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, the Scots were
very much into this anyway.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:90%
A lot of the Kings were.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:84%
They let them get along and
do their own perambulations.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
documentary, "Scotland's

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:12.013 align:middle line:84%

an overlooked chapel

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle line:10%
marks the rising of Venus on
the spring equinox in 37 AD.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Inside this humble building,
the [NON-ENGLISH] practice

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:28.670 align:middle line:90%
their magic.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.310 align:middle line:84%
As a monk named
Odhrán, a companion

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:84%
of the notorious Saint
Columba, found out for himself.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.910 align:middle line:84%
There is a legend that
the walls of the chapel

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
came down as fast as they went
up, as though by evil magic,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and only when a person
was buried alive

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:90%
would the stones stay put.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, Odhrán being
the devout Catholic

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
he was, thought this all pagan
mumbo jumbo, but to his credit,

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:84%
he volunteered to be buried
alive to prove the point.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And three days later,
the Earth was removed,

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Odhrán raised himself, and much
to everyone's bewilderment,

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:84%
he declared that all that
had been said and preached

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.590 align:middle line:90%
about hell was a complete joke.

[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Odhrán had himself an
out-of-body experience.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
He found himself
in the other world

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and returned to tell the tale
of how the universe really

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
is rather than how it is
portrayed by religion.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.500 align:middle line:84%
You see, the chapel sits
on a hotspot of energy

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.170 align:middle line:84%
that is capable of
facilitating such a journey.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
It's perhaps, the most secret
of all esoteric rituals.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was practiced for at
least 6,000 years from here

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:84%
to North America to India
and the Middle East.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And the concept of
walls going down and up

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:48.800 align:middle line:84%
is really a description of
the change of perception

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:90%
experienced during the ritual.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:84%
You literally experience
the dematerialization

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of the physical world and with
it, the temporary departure

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:84%
of the soul and its
eventual return to the body.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And Eastern mystics called it
[NON-ENGLISH] or, as we've come

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:84%
to know it via the
Essenes, "the way."

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.050 align:middle line:84%
In essence, the [NON-ENGLISH]
practiced the same near-death

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:84%
ritual once performed inside
the box in the Great Pyramid

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:84%
the world associated
with this initiation,

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:32.390 align:middle line:84%
which became known as the
"Living Resurrection."

>>NOORY: I love the architecture
of those buildings, Freddy.

>>SILVA: It's magical.

00:23:36.092 --> 00:23:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was part of
the art that they practiced,

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
was the different
use of geometry

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship of elements
and the careful use of stone.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.090 align:middle line:84%
The choice of stone was
actually what created

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.390 align:middle line:90%
the special environment.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So you can go from one
building to the next,

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.842 align:middle line:84%
it will look almost
identical, but the two

00:23:52.842 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:84%
will have a completely
different effect on you.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about the
relationship of geometry.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:90%
It's like going to Giza.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:84%
You have three
pyramids-- big pyramids.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Each one of them has their
innate angle and slope.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Every person will have
a different experience

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:84%
in the little
pyramid as they will

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
have in the middle pyramid
and the big pyramid.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's all to do with the
relationship of those angles.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:84%
It has a specific effect
on your state of awareness

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and that was part of what
the mystery teachings were

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:84%
all about and why they
were so protected.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And people took the teachings
today grave, if necessary,

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.050 align:middle line:90%
rather than give them away.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's move to
the Island of Sardinia.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Tell me its relationship
to Scotland.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, here's the
funny thing about this project,

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
that was taught to me when

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.097 align:middle line:90%
I was 12 by my history teacher.

00:24:34.097 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:84%
If you want to find the
origin of something,

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
go back at least
80 years and then

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
go somewhere else to find out
what was going on in the place

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.090 align:middle line:90%
you're examining.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So I had this
half-finished hypothesis,

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's not even in
the book at this point.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm off to Sardinia
and I'm walking around

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and looking at things
and going, wait a minute.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:84%
These are the very things
that we have in Scotland

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:84%
that archaeologists say
shouldn't be in Scotland.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.400 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know where
they came from,

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and here they are
3,000 years earlier

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:90%
being built in Sardinia.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.653 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you know
where they came from.

00:25:04.653 --> 00:25:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The same mythology,
the same construction method,

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.530 align:middle line:90%
the same associations to Orion.

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:84%
The giants are buried
all over Sardinia.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the locals, you sit
in, not a pub, like a cafe,

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and they're more
than happy to say,

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:84%
we're very proud to tell
you of the history of where

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.480 align:middle line:90%
we come from.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:84%
The giants used to have
this as a big colony.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And in the last days of
Atlantis-- and they mention

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:84%
this so freely without any
sign of any embarrassment--

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.177 align:middle line:84%
in the last days of Atlantis,
there used to be a colony here.

00:25:32.177 --> 00:25:33.260 align:middle line:90%
The giants are everywhere.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:90%
There are pyramids everywhere.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.300 align:middle line:90%
And they're absolutely right.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole vow
of silence over the island

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
because these people
are threatened,

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.470 align:middle line:84%
not just by the police,
they're threatened

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:84%
by the archaeologists
and the church

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.820 align:middle line:90%
to mention pyramids or giants.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And when they find them,
they just get removed

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.045 align:middle line:84%
and they are threatened
with their jobs.

00:25:51.045 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
That, you'll never work
on this island again,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.545 align:middle line:84%
if you talk about
what we've just seen.

00:25:54.545 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And that got me interested
immediately because suddenly, I

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:84%
realized that whatever
was happening in Scotland,

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:90%
first took place in Sardinia.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And the connection was not
just a mythology, not just

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.770 align:middle line:84%
a construction
method, but the DNA

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:84%
of the people that
were in Sardinia

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
eventually becomes
part of the Scotland.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And 24% of the DNA in
Scottish people today

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:84%
comes from Sardinia and that
comes from somewhere else.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how did
the Italian influence

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.585 align:middle line:90%
occur and take over Sardinia?

00:26:21.585 --> 00:26:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, that came much
later because, I mean, Italy,

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.360 align:middle line:90%
obviously, now governs Sardinia.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like a holiday
island for the Italians.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.640 align:middle line:84%
But that comes much more
later in the historical era.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe, it was
in the 18th century

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.910 align:middle line:84%
when finally, it
became part of Italy.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, Corsica, at the
top, becomes part of France.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is Dwarfie Stane?

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Now, the Dwarfie
Stane is an incredible big,

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.980 align:middle line:90%
well, it's not a boulder.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:10%
It's a big slab of
Devonian red stone

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.020 align:middle line:10%
that sits by itself
in a valley on one

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.000 align:middle line:10%
of the islands of the
archipelago of Orkney.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.465 align:middle line:90%
So where--

00:26:53.465 --> 00:26:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Natural?

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:54.937 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very natural.

00:26:54.937 --> 00:26:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Although, you wouldn't--
when you go there, you go,

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.440 align:middle line:90%
it's very suspicious.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.958 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a
little spaceship.

00:26:59.958 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me a lot of
the rock boats of the gods

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.130 align:middle line:84%
that they have
flying back in Japan.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:90%
But it is very natural.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.522 align:middle line:84%
It was dragged not far
away from the cliffs.

00:27:08.522 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like nothing
you've ever seen.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:14.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a big slab, which has
been hollowed out by hand

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.740 align:middle line:90%
into this very narrow chamber.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:84%
It's about 3 feet high
by about 2 feet wide.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:90%
I have to crawl in there.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go in,
there's a little chamber, which

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.597 align:middle line:90%
is like a half moon chamber.

00:27:24.597 --> 00:27:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't you
get claustrophobic?

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It began
to get a little bit

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.320 align:middle line:90%
interesting in there.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't do well with
confined spaces,

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.510 align:middle line:84%
but my curiosity gets
the better of me.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's a point
where you think,

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
maybe I shouldn't
be in here, but--

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, get out.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --to write about it,
I've got to experience it.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And then, the
other side, you got--

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
admirable of you.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --another chamber that
has, like, a picture window.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.695 align:middle line:84%
And you think, why is
there a picture window

00:27:45.695 --> 00:27:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and what looks like
a bolster for someone

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:84%
lying down with their
head on this rock bolster?

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And the angle at which it aligns
to is precisely due West--

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and I mean, it's
exactly due West--

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and there's a big stone
plug that fits exactly

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:84%
into the hole, leaving
just enough, a little bit,

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.088 align:middle line:84%
of light and enough of a
sliver of light for air.

00:28:06.088 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't meant for
anyone to be buried.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It was meant for
something to be inside.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But it was meant for the plug to
be taken out at a certain time

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:90%
to allow the person to come out.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.717 align:middle line:84%
Because when the Vikings found
it, much later on in history,

00:28:17.717 --> 00:28:19.550 align:middle line:84%
they thought there might
be treasure inside.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And the plug was
in the hole so they

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:84%
had to dig a hole from
the top to go inside

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.147 align:middle line:90%
and they found nothing.

00:28:25.147 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:90%
There was no one in there.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there
much maneuvering room?

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Not much.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:29.870 align:middle line:90%
Not for a 6 foot 5 guy.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's associated
with giants, again.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would think.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: But I did--

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:35.890 align:middle line:84%
when I began to
sort of breathe, you

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.650 align:middle line:84%
could hear the heart and the
breathing being very labored.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm
getting a sense

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.070 align:middle line:90%
that I know the note in here.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And you do a very, very
low note to the point,

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:90%
you're almost like this.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.040 align:middle line:90%
It's almost hurting your throat.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And I began to do it
for about two minutes

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:84%
without taking a breath
and suddenly, you realize,

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.830 align:middle line:90%
you're leaving the body.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.645 align:middle line:84%
There's only one other
place in the world

00:28:56.645 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I know that that is
possible and that's

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:90%
the box in the King's Chamber.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And it has exactly the
same purpose and exactly

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.280 align:middle line:90%
the same note.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So whoever had been working
in that place in Egypt also

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.707 align:middle line:90%
had worked there in Scotland.

00:29:08.707 --> 00:29:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, or they sent the
knowledge of it or something.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Exactly because
a lot of the place

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.610 align:middle line:84%
names of these sacred
sites in Orkney

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.960 align:middle line:84%
actually have an Egyptian
background, as well.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, they actually
mean exactly what they are.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's the stone
circle just up the road

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:84%
from the Dwarfie Stane,
Ring of Brodgar--

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.520 align:middle line:90%
lovely name.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Brodgar in Egyptian means
"the enclosure of the sun."

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And that stone circle actually
is an astronomical site

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
which depicts the houses of
the sun throughout the year.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.878 align:middle line:84%
So what's the Egyptian language
doing up there, I wonder?

00:29:41.878 --> 00:29:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
had an opportunity

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.290 align:middle line:84%
to talk to Regina Meredith on
"Open Minds" about Sardinia

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:90%
and some of their sites.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.580 align:middle line:90%
[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.830 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: And if you were
standing here in 8500 BC,

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.780 align:middle line:10%
you would get a
perfect alignment

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.640 align:middle line:10%
with the Equinox sunrise.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.560 align:middle line:10%
And an hour before
that, you'd see

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.097 align:middle line:10%
Venus rising just before it.

00:30:02.097 --> 00:30:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And you see this again and
again around the world.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And anytime you see
that kind of chamber,

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that's usually a place that
was used for initiation.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: And what I
find interesting about that is

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:84%
then, we are talking about--
and I say the word "cults"

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.860 align:middle line:90%
very loosely--

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:84%
but groups of individuals
that had knowledge

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that were aligned
with the sun, which

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.750 align:middle line:84%
is, in the classic
hermetic sense,

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.210 align:middle line:84%
those, the shining ones,
with the advanced knowledge

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:84%
would be the ones more prone
to aligning their structures

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:84%
toward the sun rather than
the moon cults, for example.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.825 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:31.825 --> 00:30:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Ah.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.822 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And Venus was always--

00:30:33.822 --> 00:30:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Venus rising before
the Equinox sunrise

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.780 align:middle line:84%
was always the mark
of the risen initiate.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.753 align:middle line:84%
Someone who had gone into
a special place like this,

00:30:40.753 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:84%
they would have gone in because,
well, the frequencies are here.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.753 align:middle line:90%
They're different on the inside.

00:30:44.753 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
They would have been the
ones to become much more--

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to say--

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:84%
tempered by the frequencies
inside the chamber

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.188 align:middle line:84%
because they would have actually
been beneficial to them.

00:30:55.188 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And we know that these
frequencies actually

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.170 align:middle line:84%
align with the human body
in a way that drives down

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:84%
your state of thinking to a
place where it's not thinking.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:02.350 align:middle line:90%
But you're doing--

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Going into a more alpha
state or even a delta state

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:05.990 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that
this is positioned

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.890 align:middle line:90%
in really critical lay line--

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, definitely.

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:12.848 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: --matrices.

00:31:12.848 --> 00:31:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Every single sacred
site on the face of the Earth

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is aligned exactly where the
Earth's telluric currents

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.060 align:middle line:90%
happen to be.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Whether they were
manipulated there

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.590 align:middle line:84%
or whether they were
already there to begin with,

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.625 align:middle line:90%
that's another story.

00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a chicken
and egg situation.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, they mark the
way the X marks the spot.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who's
sensitive and can't afford

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.080 align:middle line:84%
$20,000 pieces of equipment
will actually pick up this stuff

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and a $20,000 piece of
equipment will do it, too.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just a lot cheaper
if you just sit here

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and actually, get a sense
that there's something

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:90%
unusual about this place.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: So chicken or egg.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.410 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that the shaman
of the day or the priests

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:54.760 align:middle line:84%
of the day understood that
this had a particular ley line

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.820 align:middle line:84%
pattern here that was
beneficial for building this?

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying by
evidence that it's built,

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.510 align:middle line:84%
we know that the
ley lines are here.

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Both.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.485 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating place.

00:32:03.485 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Why were you
holding an umbrella?

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The Sardinians
were apologizing.

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:09.910 align:middle line:84%
They said, we have
never had this much rain

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.880 align:middle line:84%
ever historically on the
island and here we are filming.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, the
technicians, the guy

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.790 align:middle line:84%
managed to get three
episodes out of this.

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:17.745 align:middle line:90%
It was hard work.

00:32:17.745 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had great
conversations with plop, plop,

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:20.680 align:middle line:90%
plop, plop, plop.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.972 align:middle line:84%
Well, great, cut, but we
can't hear what you're saying.

00:32:22.972 --> 00:32:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
was all on Sardinia.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.602 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, Sardinia
is incredible.

00:32:26.602 --> 00:32:29.018 align:middle line:84%
I need to go back there and
finish the job because there's

00:32:29.018 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:90%
so much going on.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
population on that island?

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:33.882 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I don't know,
but it's very sparse.

00:32:33.882 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you either-- you have
Cagliari at the bottom, which

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.425 align:middle line:84%
is the capital, and Abruzzo
at the north and between that,

00:32:40.425 --> 00:32:41.800 align:middle line:84%
there's not really
much going on,

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.110 align:middle line:84%
very small villages, and I
kind of like it that way.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And people who know
things, their grandparents

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and their parents, will
volunteer information

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's part
of the folklore

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.928 align:middle line:90%
and that's what really helps us.

00:32:52.928 --> 00:32:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for example, they
have an entire culture.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.560 align:middle line:84%
They're called the
Nuragic culture.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And I can't find any historian
or any archaeologist that

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.780 align:middle line:84%
will explain to me,
what is Nuragic mean?

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:90%
They say, well, we don't know.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, why did you name your
entire culture of your island

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:08.890 align:middle line:90%
the Nuragic culture?

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:10.150 align:middle line:90%
And they can't explain it.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, a year later of research,
I began to learn Armenian.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Found that the
"nurag" is actually

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.500 align:middle line:90%
a Holy person or a legate.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And the people that said
that they built these temples

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:84%
in Sardinia, like the round
towers that we find there

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:84%
and in Scotland and those giant
graves where no giants are

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:30.010 align:middle line:84%
buried, they said, yeah, these
were a special spiritual group

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.600 align:middle line:84%
of people that were
understanding of the stars

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
and they were also priests,
so they're astronomer priests.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what a
"nurag" means in Armenian.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's the
Armenian connection

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.410 align:middle line:84%
now between the movement
of people in Sardinia.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And also, their DNA
is also found there

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.400 align:middle line:90%
and it's also found in Scotland.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have three stepping
stones connecting these places.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy, tell us
about the Ring of Brodgar.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The Ring
of Brodgar, it's,

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.110 align:middle line:84%
like, you feel like someone up
there wrote "Lord of the Rings"

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:90%
from these names.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Ring of Brodgar is wonderful.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not situated
at the place where

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.820 align:middle line:84%
you'd expect sort
of a big astrolabe

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:90%
to be because that's what it is.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.480 align:middle line:84%
It marks the solar
and lunar calendars

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.550 align:middle line:90%
and attracts the stars.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:13.520 align:middle line:10%
It should be a bit higher up, it
should be on more level ground,

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.070 align:middle line:10%
but they shifted it
further just to the south,

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.110 align:middle line:10%
just enough, to make
sure that everything

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.850 align:middle line:10%
calibrates with the horizon.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.860 align:middle line:10%
But in the middle
of the stone circle,

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:10%
it marks the exact 59th
parallel of latitude.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.110 align:middle line:90%
So they are very--

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that's not a question, why were
they marking this very exact

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:30.949 align:middle line:90%
parallel?

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:34.288 align:middle line:84%
It comes with its own
mystical story of giants

00:34:34.288 --> 00:34:35.330 align:middle line:90%
who were turned to stone.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
there was a fiddler that

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:40.250 align:middle line:84%
sprang up a very lusty
tune on his fiddle one day.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.949 align:middle line:84%
And this giant had to
get back to their home

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:84%
before the sun came up,
but they got so distracted

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.650 align:middle line:84%
by the tune and the dancing
that they forgot the sunrise

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:50.090 align:middle line:90%
and they get turned to stone.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And you hear this
story again and again.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, the
name Brodgar in Armenian

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:84%
actually means
dance song stones.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So the mythology
is actually named

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:84%
after the name of
the site, which

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:04.830 align:middle line:90%
is based on Armenian language.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So again, you have a
mixture of cultures

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.610 align:middle line:84%
on this completely windswept
island off the north

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:15.770 align:middle line:84%
coast of Scotland, which the
site itself took 166,000 man

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:16.850 align:middle line:90%
hours to create.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.670 align:middle line:90%
They had to level the bedrock.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.420 align:middle line:84%
They had to build--
it's the biggest stone

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.537 align:middle line:84%
circle in the whole
of Europe, I believe.

00:35:23.537 --> 00:35:24.620 align:middle line:90%
If not, the British Isles.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that called
the Stenness Stone Circle

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.410 align:middle line:90%
or is that something else?

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:28.993 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Stenness
is the one just down

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:31.370 align:middle line:84%
the hill, which is a little
bit smaller and priceless.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's part of
three stone circles.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.822 align:middle line:84%
The third one,
hardly anyone even

00:35:35.822 --> 00:35:38.030 align:middle line:84%
knows it's there because
the stones had been pilfered

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.130 align:middle line:90%
for the local farmyard.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But together, they
form an alignment,

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.480 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, two
big stone circles,

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.390 align:middle line:84%
one little one slightly
offset from the other, which

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:50.480 align:middle line:84%
is a complete mirror image of
the first rising of Orion's

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.390 align:middle line:84%
belt over Orkney in
a natural landscape

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.180 align:middle line:90%
bowl of the horizon in 5300 BC.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So we have an exact date of
when these people were there.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lía Fáil, what is that?

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The Lía Fáil-- the
Sacred Stone of Islands.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a whole
sort of story in itself.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've got
magical stones everywhere

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.165 align:middle line:90%
on this island.

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:09.665 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Absolutely
because you see,

00:36:09.665 --> 00:36:11.960 align:middle line:84%
the stones wouldn't
just-- you didn't just

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.570 align:middle line:84%
go and get an ordinary stone
off the side of the road.

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to go
sometimes 400 miles

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:84%
to get the right stone with
the right chemical composition

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:22.040 align:middle line:84%
in order to be put in
the exact place where

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.002 align:middle line:84%
the Earth's telluric currents
just happened to cross.

00:36:25.002 --> 00:36:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the old days, we
could figure this out.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.815 align:middle line:84%
And you could speak to the
Hopi or the Aboriginal people

00:36:29.815 --> 00:36:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say,
oh, I know where

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.230 align:middle line:84%
it is because I can see them,
I can feel them right there,

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.160 align:middle line:90%
and they can.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you and I forget
about these natural abilities

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and we forget where
the energy is,

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.080 align:middle line:84%
they would then mark
where X happens to be.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So the stone with its
magnetite and its iron

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and its crystalline
structure, when

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.530 align:middle line:84%
it's anchored into that
particular electromagnetic

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.300 align:middle line:84%
current, the current
charges the stone.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you are there
at the right moment,

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
at the right time
when it hasn't been

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.690 align:middle line:90%
this charge for a long time--

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the thousands
will tell you this--

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.380 align:middle line:84%
you go up to the
stone and you think,

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.390 align:middle line:90%
this stone wants to talk to me.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:06.720 align:middle line:90%
It has something to say.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Talking stones.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.015 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The stones want
to-- it's like a computer.

00:37:10.015 --> 00:37:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And you go up to it, and
I've done this so many times

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.690 align:middle line:84%
foolishly, and I just
put my hand on the stone.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:17.102 align:middle line:84%
I get one hell of a belt.
For the next 15 minutes,

00:37:17.102 --> 00:37:18.560 align:middle line:84%
you can't feel your
entire forearm.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You get
an electric shock.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can't stop
talking because all you can see

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000 align:middle line:90%
is this vision because--

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.708 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
transmitting stuff to you?

00:37:25.708 --> 00:37:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The stone, the quartz,
it's just like a computer.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:31.520 align:middle line:84%
The silica in the stone
remembers everything around it.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.220 align:middle line:84%
You come along and you connect
with it, whether physically

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.810 align:middle line:90%
or through telepathy.

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:37.563 align:middle line:84%
You download the
information, and then

00:37:37.563 --> 00:37:39.980 align:middle line:84%
you start writing about it,
and you go, well, I can't just

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.180 align:middle line:90%
say this in a book.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.740 align:middle line:84%
I've got to back
this up with facts.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, you spend a year
researching the local history

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.970 align:middle line:90%
and it's right there.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So the stone gives
you the information,

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
you then go and double
check it, and it actually

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.580 align:middle line:90%
conforms to the local folklore.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And boom, now you've
got the backup

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:56.000 align:middle line:90%
to what you've just seen.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they did this
stuff because these stones are

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.830 align:middle line:90%
like mnemonic devices.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.340 align:middle line:90%
They record everything.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
Egyptians, like for the core

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.920 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids, the stones
didn't come there by it.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.910 align:middle line:84%
They came 400 miles from down
the Nile and now we know why.

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:13.475 align:middle line:84%
They were very specific about
this natural technology.

00:38:13.475 --> 00:38:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have to have
the right kind of stone.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:16.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Kilmartin
Glen, what is that?

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Kilmartin
Glen is beautiful.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.500 align:middle line:10%
It was very important
for the Templars who

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.570 align:middle line:10%
put one of their
three main sites

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.220 align:middle line:10%
when they escaped to Scotland.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.440 align:middle line:84%
It's also one of
the oldest places

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.180 align:middle line:90%
in the Scottish mainland.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So as the weather's
changing, the cultures

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.620 align:middle line:84%
are moving off the islands now
onto the mainland of Scotland.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.180 align:middle line:84%
It has some of the oldest sacred
sites in the mainland Scotland

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and also, the greatest
concentration.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole valley
and a whole plain just full

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:45.680 align:middle line:84%
of mounds, passage
chambers, and yes, they've

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.310 align:middle line:90%
got burial sites there, as well.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest
concentration of rocks,

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:54.260 align:middle line:84%
which are carved with all manner
of spirals and, like, circles

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and ripples and little
cups and marks and it's

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.360 align:middle line:84%
as though, it was a place
for understanding the stars.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you go there and
stand next to these big stones

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.658 align:middle line:84%
and you look up at
the sky and the stone,

00:39:04.658 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:84%
you think, they're
trying to tell you

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.408 align:middle line:90%
something about the sky here.

00:39:07.408 --> 00:39:08.867 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
written about this.

00:39:08.867 --> 00:39:09.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a complete mystery.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But the original one,
the precursor to these stones,

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.230 align:middle line:84%
is actually in Sardinia in the
back of a bed and breakfast.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.760 align:middle line:84%
It's still standing
there to this very day.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's get a
very close up experience

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.760 align:middle line:84%
from the Ring of Brodgar
from Matias de Stefano

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.436 align:middle line:90%
who talks about it.

00:39:24.436 --> 00:39:25.250 align:middle line:90%
[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:27.960 align:middle line:10%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO:
I went to the stones

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.780 align:middle line:10%
and I put just aside
one of the stones,

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.480 align:middle line:10%
like, if each one of the
stones were a person,

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.540 align:middle line:10%
and I felt part of that circle.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And I heard a voice in
between the stones saying,

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.220 align:middle line:90%
"we are here to watch you."

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so
where do I belong?

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.030 align:middle line:90%
And they said, "in the center."

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:10%
So I started to walk to
the center of the stones,

00:39:55.140 --> 00:40:00.420 align:middle line:10%
and I got to the middle of
it, and suddenly, I kind of

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.970 align:middle line:10%
accepted that I had
to be in the center.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.420 align:middle line:90%
So I am the center.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
stones started to say,

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.760 align:middle line:90%
"Every circle has a center.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.800 align:middle line:84%
With our center,
there is no circle.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.150 align:middle line:84%
With our circle,
there is no center.

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So you are never alone and
your work is with the team,

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:23.280 align:middle line:90%
but the team is to surround you.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.510 align:middle line:84%
The team is to hold
everything to be a sphere.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:29.820 align:middle line:90%
And you mark the center.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go?

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:32.220 align:middle line:90%
I am."

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:38.170 align:middle line:84%
When I said this,
something in me

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.900 align:middle line:84%
started to see every
one of my lives

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and every one of the stones
became each one of me,

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.570 align:middle line:90%
of myself, staring at me.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Not other people.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.250 align:middle line:90%
It was just my soul watching me.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And every stone was
one of my lives.

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:58.750 align:middle line:90%
And I saw all of them.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And they started to come to
me and becoming me and saying,

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.520 align:middle line:84%
"We are the circle
that holds who you are.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So don't expect for others
to be in that circle.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:15.230 align:middle line:84%
We are that circle that
puts you in the center."

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So it was very
healing, that moment,

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:24.760 align:middle line:84%
in which my soul kind of let
itself die from all the weight

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:29.620 align:middle line:84%
that it was waiting for being
in the center for other people.

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Like, the responsibility
of being seen by others,

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.030 align:middle line:84%
but they said the only
ones from which you

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:40.330 align:middle line:84%
have to feel that
you are being seen

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:44.530 align:middle line:84%
is ourselves, which is yourself
in different timelines.

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy, it sounds like
he had some kind of epiphany

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.490 align:middle line:90%
with the stones, too.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The good thing about
these very out of the way

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:53.950 align:middle line:84%
places, which take
effort to get their,

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.680 align:middle line:84%
cost of fortune to fly there,
and then you get bad weather

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.650 align:middle line:84%
when you get there, is
the fact that-- and this

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:84%
is very specific, not just of
Orkney, but even more specific

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.653 align:middle line:84%
of the Isle of Lewis
where we have some stone

00:42:04.653 --> 00:42:06.820 align:middle line:84%
circles, which, unless you
know how to read the map,

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.787 align:middle line:90%
you won't find them.

00:42:07.787 --> 00:42:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're some of
my favorite places

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:13.210 align:middle line:84%
because they've been totally
unaffected by war, human folly

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:14.780 align:middle line:90%
of any other kind of problem.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.548 align:middle line:84%
So if the stones
remember everything--

00:42:16.548 --> 00:42:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost pristine.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You just
go to these places

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:20.618 align:middle line:84%
and it's like you're
meeting your family.

00:42:20.618 --> 00:42:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't
even tell you how--

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.980 align:middle line:84%
I never get bored
looking at these things.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've taken
people on tours there

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard to peel
them off the stones.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.230 align:middle line:84%
They literally become
part of the stone.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched them change,
literally, within a week

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.313 align:middle line:84%
and they become completely
different people.

00:42:33.313 --> 00:42:34.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like they
recognize who they

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:36.460 align:middle line:84%
are, what they're
doing here, but it's

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.870 align:middle line:90%
a very personal journey.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:41.813 align:middle line:84%
It's though-- and my advice is,
go in there expecting nothing.

00:42:41.813 --> 00:42:43.730 align:middle line:84%
If you go there expecting
something to happen,

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:44.530 align:middle line:90%
it won't happen.

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Go in there with an open
mind and ask a question.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:50.110 align:middle line:84%
For example, my usual one
is, what's this really about?

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Because my purpose is to
be a teacher to others.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I have to know my trade in
order to be a good teacher

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:56.330 align:middle line:90%
to somebody else.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So I just say,
what is this about?

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, there'll
be one stone that--

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.040 align:middle line:84%
like all of them, they'll just
stand out and they'll say,

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:03.850 align:middle line:90%
"come over here."

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:04.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'll go, really?

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Freddy.

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And I go, Freddy.

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure they
even know my name.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.510 align:middle line:90%
And I'll go and stand there.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:12.640 align:middle line:90%
I just put my back to the stone.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.918 align:middle line:84%
And before I realize it,
an hour's disappeared.

00:43:14.918 --> 00:43:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that I've been
standing next to the stone

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.400 align:middle line:90%
for five seconds.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.998 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'm just
writing everything down.

00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this is
really incredible stuff.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And it leads on to
another year of research.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a great location
in which to really just download

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:29.050 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:30.938 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even
have to believe it.

00:43:30.938 --> 00:43:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anybody
to believe this.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.740 align:middle line:84%
I want to go and experience it
for yourself because this is

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.410 align:middle line:84%
why the places were built.
And there's one in Lewis that

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm very specific about
called [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.630 align:middle line:84%
It's original name in Armenian
means "the place of seeing."

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.297 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most
important stone circle

00:43:48.297 --> 00:43:50.755 align:middle line:84%
in the whole island and that's
where the priests used to go

00:43:50.755 --> 00:43:52.115 align:middle line:90%
to do their vision quests.

00:43:52.115 --> 00:43:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
gave it their name.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Magical.

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's why
you go to these places,

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:84%
to have this
interdimensional experience.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy, where can
people see your documentary

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:01.840 align:middle line:90%
and get your books?

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, they
can go on "Gaia."

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:04.900 align:middle line:10%
They can go on my website--

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:09.640 align:middle line:10%
invisibletemple.com-- and you'll
be there for a long, long time.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Eight books, 14
documentaries, and there's

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.080 align:middle line:84%
another one in the
pipeline somewhere.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Never a boring moment.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you rate
that area of Sardinia compared

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:21.030 align:middle line:90%
to other places on the planet?

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.830 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Original.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:23.260 align:middle line:10%
They're all completely original.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.810 align:middle line:10%
Sardinia stands up by
itself because it's

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.790 align:middle line:10%
one of the highest
concentrations of the most

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:30.200 align:middle line:10%
ancient DNA in the
whole of Europe.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And its connections to
Armenia extend the story

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.610 align:middle line:84%
even further back
into pre-history.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's part of another
developing, eye-opening series

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:84%
in this quest to
try and find out

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.060 align:middle line:90%
what the ancients were up to.

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.373 align:middle line:84%
Freddy, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:45.373 --> 00:44:46.645 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Always a pleasure.

00:44:46.645 --> 00:44:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These mystical
areas are truly remarkable.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.940 align:middle line:10%
Much more than one
would ever expect.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.810 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief."
