Neuralink is one
of the new channels

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.070 align:middle line:84%
that will allow us to interface
directly with the brain.

with a Neuralink interface

or any sort of
computer interface

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:84%
is learn how to remotely operate
heavy equipment, a machine,

Thank you, George.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a real pleasure to be here.

>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.665 align:middle line:10%
>>SHULTS: I've always been
fascinated by science,

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:10%
and I always wanted
to understand

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:10%
how everything worked.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.112 align:middle line:10%
When I was a child, I figured
I'd be living and working

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:10%
in space, so I'd better
learn everything I possibly

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:10%
could just to make myself
capable of supporting

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:10%
that sort of a lifestyle.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You love space too.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:10%
>>SHULTS: I absolutely
love it, yes.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.247 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Were you so

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.425 align:middle line:10%
and those anomalies you
found, and stuff like that?

00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:57.300 align:middle line:10%
>>SHULTS: Absolutely.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's something I feel
people should know about.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
dealt with something

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
that is coming across this
planet in record numbers,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
Neuralink system.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean how do you explain that?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Hardly a night doesn't go
by on my radio show where

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:84%
somebody calls in
and says, George,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:90%
there are 25 UFOs up there.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the Neuralink
satellite system.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.820 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: [LAUGHS]
Well, Neuralink

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.642 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have anything to do
with satellites, of course.

00:02:25.642 --> 00:02:28.445 align:middle line:84%
It's actually based on
a very simple premise.

00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Through all of history,
the human brain

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.733 align:middle line:84%
has been an isolated
item, and the only way

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
you know what's
in a person's mind

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:84%
is through what they
write, or speak, or do.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:90%
That's all about to change.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Neuralink is one
of the new channels

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
that will allow us to interface
directly with the brain.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And there are two of
those types of channels

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:90%
that exist right now.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:90%
One of them is functional MRI.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%
We have people who are comatose
and unresponsive and unable

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:90%
to communicate.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have a means of seeing
what's in their mind now.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:84%
We literally can get a
picture of what they're

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:90%
imagining in their heads.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And so they've found
anywhere from one out

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
of three to one out
of six of these people

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:84%
are fully aware but
unable to say anything.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll
say, OK, I'm going

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:84%
to ask you some questions,
yes-or-no questions.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And if the answer is yes,
think of a green square.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And if the answer is no,
think of a red triangle.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:90%
And then they talk to them.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And looking at the
monitor, they can

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.418 align:middle line:84%
see what that person is
visualizing in the head,

00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and they've established
communications with them.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, now this is amazing.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.020 align:middle line:84%
We can see locked-in people
actually are many times aware.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, now Neuralink gives
us a direct channel.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're aware
of the experiments that

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:84%
were done by Elon Musk's group
to teach a monkey to play

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:90%
a video game such as pong.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, amazing.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: And so
they plant a chip

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:84%
about the size of a postage
stamp with thousands

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:84%
of tiny electrodes, like
needles, into the tissue

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.600 align:middle line:84%
of the brain in an area where
there's a map of your body

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:90%
called the homunculus.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
of moving, there's

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.910 align:middle line:84%
a certain firing
pattern of neurons.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So they collect that firing
pattern through Bluetooth

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle line:90%
to a program that analyzes it.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And the program figures
out predictably where

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:90%
you're going to move.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the monkey
used a joystick.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And the program figured out what
his moves were going to be--

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.865 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Before he did it.

00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: --before he did it.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Then they disconnect
the joystick.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And the monkey's
playing the game,

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.350 align:middle line:84%
but the actual link is through
the Neuralink to the game.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Then they remove the joystick.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And the monkey sees
the game and thinks

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:84%
about the movements
he would make,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and the computer sends
those codes to the program

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:90%
and plays the game.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is this important?

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:84%
There are many people who are
paralyzed, whether paraplegic,

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:90%
or quadriplegic, or worse.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have a
means of communicating.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So this gives them the
ability to interface

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
an artificial nerve system
or actually augment their own

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:90%
so they can regain control.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.660 align:middle line:84%
They could even add
limbs that are missing,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.545 align:middle line:84%
such as prosthetics, and control
them directly by thinking.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the many things

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.188 align:middle line:90%
you could do with Neuralink.

00:04:58.188 --> 00:05:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There would be chips
in your head, literally, right?

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.605 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Absolutely.

00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:04.233 align:middle line:84%
And in most cases, they're about
the size of a postage stamp.

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a company called
Synchron that's making them

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:90%
about an inch and a half long.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're one of the major
competitors with Elon Musk's

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.202 align:middle line:90%
company, Neuralink.

00:05:12.202 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
they discovered--

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's the one
putting up the satellites.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Well, yes.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.422 align:middle line:84%
He's putting up satellites, but
they're for Starlink internet

00:05:18.422 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it
works pretty well.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
area you're in.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's so popular,
I think they're

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:90%
running out of channels.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Well, I
would get it myself,

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's not available in
the area where I'm moving.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you get a chip
in your brain if you needed it?

00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: I don't think
that I would at this time.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I feel that the-- you
never buy the earliest

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.307 align:middle line:90%
version of a technology.

00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
reasons I put forward.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I would wait until it
was more developed.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.598 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With anything?

00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: With anything, sure.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
the benefits of doing

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:90%
this long-range, though?

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: OK.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So imagine you have to
work in an extremely

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.645 align:middle line:90%
dangerous environment.

00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:84%
You'd rather have a
robot in that environment

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:84%
than a human being
that could die.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things you can
do with a Neuralink interface

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
or any sort of
computer interface

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:84%
is learn how to remotely operate
heavy equipment, a machine,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
as if you're putting
on a robot body.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
You can work in
areas where there

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:84%
are pressures, or
temperatures, or radiation

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that would kill you instantly
by using a proxy, an avatar,

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Science is moving way too
fast sometimes, Sir Charles.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Well, it
would seem, in times

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.880 align:middle line:84%
past when our technology
wasn't as advanced,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
we had time to see the
ramifications of things

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:90%
that we were doing.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Today, that's not
necessarily the case.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Within a month, or two,
or three, or a year,

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:84%
they want to go
to the next stage

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.458 align:middle line:84%
without fully analyzing what
the repercussions might be.

00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a downside to this?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Well, there can be.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.440 align:middle line:84%
The same sort of technology
that can plug into your brain

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
could also be used to write
memories, or erase memories,

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.890 align:middle line:90%
or alter your personality.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And I understand
from, let's say,

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:84%
a psychotherapy standpoint,
this might be helpful.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.532 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want it to be
something against a person's

00:07:01.532 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:84%
will, and you don't want
to do something that's

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.700 align:middle line:84%
going to violate their
personal sovereignty,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:90%
in a manner of speaking.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they turn you
into a Manchurian Candidate?

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Well, there's no
doubt that that could be done.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.387 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's been done
with psychological and drug

00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:90%
programming in the past.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: So there's
that possibility.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.492 align:middle line:84%
On the other end of this
spectrum, there are--

00:07:22.492 --> 00:07:24.700 align:middle line:84%
well, there are very good
things you can do as well--

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
restoring damaged memory,
possibly augmenting parts

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.850 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that have
been damaged by tumors,

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:90%
or illnesses, or cancer.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:84%
You can do a lot of things
with this sort of technology,

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.272 align:middle line:84%
including saving
memories and experiences

00:07:39.272 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:90%
that otherwise would be lost.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.938 align:middle line:84%
There's an old
African proverb that

00:07:41.938 --> 00:07:45.910 align:middle line:84%
says, "When an old man dies, a
library burns to the ground."

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
What if you could save
all of your experience

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge that you
would otherwise lose at death?

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
"The Truman Show."

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Well, in
some ways, it is.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot of people
are unaware of how deeply this

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:90%
could lead.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
If you can implant sensory
inputs into the mind,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:84%
you could create a false
world around somebody,

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and they could live in
basically a sandbox universe

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:84%
of their making or
not of their making.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's something to
consider that it's possible

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:84%
that this could be an invasive
project that literally leads

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:90%
to living in a dream world.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they doing
this to us now, Sir Charles?

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: I would doubt that.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
things that would seem

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:90%
to be consistent in reality.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you were making
a false reality,

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:84%
it would be too easy
to slip up somewhere.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
might point to things like,

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.070 align:middle line:84%
what they feel are
glitches in the matrix,

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:90%
as you've heard of these events.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Three fellows with the same
shirt on a bus in a row.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.950 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that we ourselves

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:84%
are in a reality of
mankind's making.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.638 align:middle line:84%
Some would argue that our
whole world is a simulation,

00:08:50.638 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's hard to
prove or disprove,

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:90%
but it's a possibility.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Artificial
intelligence,

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.002 align:middle line:90%
is it going too far, too fast?

00:08:57.002 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: I think that
one of the things people

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
fail to recognize is
about 90% of the funding

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.420 align:middle line:84%
for the development of
artificial intelligence

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:84%
comes from military
or financial projects,

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.990 align:middle line:90%
and that isn't a good sign.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:84%
We often talk about the lone
inventor or the military team

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.900 align:middle line:90%
programming an AI.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And you have to wonder if
such a thing they create

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.450 align:middle line:84%
would actually be
sane by our standards,

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.450 align:middle line:90%
and that's a real worry.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.283 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:09:23.283 --> 00:09:24.527 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about singularity.

00:09:24.527 --> 00:09:25.360 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Ah, the singularity.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the growth
of human knowledge,

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:90%
we know that it isn't linear.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
If we take the number of
facts we had at year one

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and compare it to
the number of facts

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:84%
we had at year 1,000
in the Middle Ages,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:84%
we can see that the
amount of knowledge about

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:90%
doubled in humanity.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
In another 500 years,
it doubled again.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
In another quarter of a
millennium, it doubled again.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:84%
We are now at the point where
the growth of information

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge is
outstripping our ability

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:90%
to appreciate and understand it.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And the singularity
occurs when it

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:84%
is no longer possible
to predict what

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.100 align:middle line:90%
happens next on a daily basis.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.990 align:middle line:84%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.390 align:middle line:10%
- The singularity brings
with it the good, the bad,

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:10%
and the ugly.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:10%
It can bring dramatic
changes and problem

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:10%
solving for humanity in terms of
economics, physics, chemistry,

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.930 align:middle line:10%
medicine.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about miraculous
new discoveries and solutions

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:90%
to very human problems.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.720 align:middle line:84%
The bad is that it's
going to cost us millions

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:90%
upon millions of jobs.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:10%
As much as 90% of
the human population

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:10%
will be unemployed when the
singularity takes place.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:90%
That leads to the ugly.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:84%
The potential for anarchy
is absolutely astounding,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and nobody seems to be
talking about that potential

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
of unleashing the power of
artificial intelligence.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Take a look around your
life, your daily life.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.187 align:middle line:90%
You go into a coffee shop.

00:10:51.187 --> 00:10:52.270 align:middle line:90%
You go to the dry cleaner.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.260 align:middle line:90%
You see a policeman.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:90%
You see a taxi driver.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Any and all of
those jobs will be

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.920 align:middle line:84%
eliminated from a
human perspective

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and replaced by artificially
intelligent robots

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:90%
within 10 years.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.070 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about the
singularity eliminating jobs,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
almost any job that

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:90%
involves any kind of routine.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Doctors, lawyers-- eliminated,
replaced by AI robots.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:10%
Menial jobs, however-- street
sweepers and construction

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:10%
workers--

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:10%
this is the type of job that
is very difficult for machines

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:10%
to do.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:10%
Anything that we can
do with our human hands

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.940 align:middle line:10%
and involves
movement in our feet

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:10%
are jobs that will
ultimately be secure.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Thinking jobs,
however, are going

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle line:84%
to be eliminated
on a human basis

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and will be replaced
by machines.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the advantages of
achieving the singularity

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
is that it unites human
intelligence with machine

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.280 align:middle line:84%
intelligence to solve
human problems, problems

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
with the environment,
problems with biology,

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:90%
problems in medicine.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.010 align:middle line:10%
If we can solve
these problems, we're

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:10%
talking about miraculous
cures for diseases.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.020 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
a new way of living.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:10%
But the cost is unparalleled
and beyond our comprehension.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence can
have a revolutionary impact

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
on our politics, on
medicine, on our environment,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.720 align:middle line:84%
on biology because
of its ability

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:84%
to access massive
amounts of data

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.367 align:middle line:84%
in perceived patterns that
would take perhaps a human years

00:12:21.367 --> 00:12:22.325 align:middle line:90%

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.107 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it has some
pluses and minuses, obviously.

00:12:25.107 --> 00:12:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Certainly.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
here is, as was pointed out,

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.730 align:middle line:84%
many of the intellectual
jobs can be automated.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Once you have an algorithm
for doing things properly,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that generally
becomes a solution.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.667 align:middle line:84%
But when we talk about
loss of employment,

00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:40.250 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
things to consider.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
In the year 1200, how
many people were employed?

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.253 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they worked at the
business of staying alive.

00:12:47.253 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: When we look at
how we lived in the 1950s,

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.900 align:middle line:84%
'60s, and '70s, there was a
survey done that said, in order

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.740 align:middle line:84%
to provide the level of service
that we experience in our life

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:84%
due to simple devices like
refrigeration and vehicles,

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.780 align:middle line:84%
it would take about 86
slaves' equivalent of effort

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
to give us that level of
living, that standard of living.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in a
position where it's

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.590 align:middle line:84%
hard to gauge that because
a lot of what we do

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:90%
is based on information.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So I think the big
flaw in this reasoning

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle line:84%
is that you must be
gainfully employed

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:84%
in the system that runs
the economy in order to be

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.130 align:middle line:90%
a positive asset to humanity.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot of
people could live off

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:84%
grid and quite
successfully on their own

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.120 align:middle line:84%
without any bad effects
on the rest of us.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sir Charles, are
we going to have robocops

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.842 align:middle line:90%
like William Henry predicted?

00:13:36.842 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: There's
no doubt of that.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.110 align:middle line:84%
You may remember the big
dog by Boston Dynamics,

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
the four-legged runaround
pack carrier robot.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:90%
They have smaller versions now.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.273 align:middle line:84%
And they have recently
appeared armed.

00:13:49.273 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's been said
that they'll be

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.437 align:middle line:84%
used on front lines and
patrolling military borders

00:13:53.437 --> 00:13:54.395 align:middle line:90%
and this sort of thing.

00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.532 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: But the
suggestion has also

00:13:56.532 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:84%
been made that they could
be placed in areas of town

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.880 align:middle line:84%
where there are a lot
of crime or rioting,

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and that's a slippery
slope because then

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:84%
just a few steps further,
and pretty soon machines

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
could be patrolling
the city's streets.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.530 align:middle line:90%
And so we don't want to--

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shooting at will.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: And
that's the problem.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to see this
sort of thing happen.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how do we
circumvent this development

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:84%
from becoming a standard
fixture in our lives?

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:84%
The problem, in
my estimation, is

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that we don't teach people
ethics along with technology.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And we need to focus on
ethics, what makes us human.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.207 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and you can't
program ethics, can you?

00:14:38.207 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: I would say you could.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, consider that if you
can create a machine that

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:84%
has a self-image and has an
understanding of rules and law,

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.150 align:middle line:84%
perhaps you can take
it to the next step

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and give it a sense of
morality and ethics.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Even if it doesn't
feel emotionally,

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
it could still
evaluate, at some level,

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:02.380 align:middle line:84%
what would be the ethical
choice, minimal to no harm.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:90%
You see where I'm going.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't this violating
all of Isaac Asimov's rules

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:08.910 align:middle line:90%
of robots?

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Ah.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, see, this is
a very good point.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Asimov's fictional robotic
laws were really a benchmark

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.410 align:middle line:84%
because for the very
first time, somebody

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
had quantified exactly
or codified perhaps

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
what it would take to
create robots that can work

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:90%
within a human civilization.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.080 align:middle line:84%
The first law, you
can't harm a human

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:84%
unless something horrible
happens that forces you to.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Second law, you can't
disobey humans' instructions

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.900 align:middle line:84%
unless it violates the
first law, and so on.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:84%
But it was found that the
laws were inconsistent

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:84%
because a machine could decide
that there's an overriding

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.700 align:middle line:84%
law that you must do
everything you can

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:90%
to prevent any harm to humans.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would end up
being a dictatorship.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.550 align:middle line:90%
So we would lose all choice.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So while in concept
it's a great idea,

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.950 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really
hold logically.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, you and
I have the ability

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what's
right in a society.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
You're free to do
anything you choose to do.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.520 align:middle line:90%
You have free will.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
you have an obligation

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:90%
not to do any harm.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.960 align:middle line:90%
But it could backfire.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Well, it can.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.032 align:middle line:84%
Many times, people
will say, well,

00:16:19.032 --> 00:16:20.490 align:middle line:84%
we're doing this
for your own good.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And that typically is a false
face for the desire to control.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
desire for one person

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:84%
to control the lives of another
is probably a mental illness.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So, Charles, what
is mind uploading?

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Ah.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.560 align:middle line:84%
This actually takes
off directly from what

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing in the Neuralink,
the possibility of taking

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.590 align:middle line:84%
the elements of your memory,
your personality, everything

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that makes you you and uploading
a copy into the computer

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:90%
and then activating it.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.998 align:middle line:84%
And so there's two
types of memories

00:16:50.998 --> 00:16:52.290 align:middle line:90%
that would have to be uploaded.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:84%
One is, of course, all
of your experiences,

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and memories, and
things that you've done.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:84%
But the other one is the
procedures, the decisions

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
you make, and how you go about
it, your sense of ethics,

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and morality, and
operational rules.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Once you get an image
like that in the computer

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.869 align:middle line:84%
and you activate it,
there's a very good chance

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:12.869 align:middle line:84%
that if the simulated world and
the computer that it inhabits

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:84%
is realistic enough, it would
feel very much like it is you.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine going into
a studio, sitting down,

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:84%
having some sort of scanning
procedure performed.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that scan,
either one of two things

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:30.090 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
stand up and go home,

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to realize
you're not where you were,

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.945 align:middle line:84%
which would be a good
indication that you're the copy.

00:17:35.945 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may be the
copy-- the digital version.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: You may be the copy.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, there can be some
advantages to this.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
If the body is killed,
the mind could live on.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And effectively, you
could be immortal.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.365 align:middle line:84%
One of the things to
consider is that you

00:17:49.365 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:84%
don't know who might edit or
alter who and what you are.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to do
things like that.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They talk about us
living in a digital universe.

00:17:58.835 --> 00:17:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Well, absolutely.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.198 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If that's the
case, who's controlling it?

00:18:02.198 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: And that's the thing.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
artificial intelligence,

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.280 align:middle line:84%
we often think that people
will develop the elements

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:90%
independently.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But as has usually
been the case,

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:84%
we learn a lot from
nature and the world

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and organisms around us.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it may well be that
uploaded mind sections will

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.410 align:middle line:84%
be analyzed and
pressed into service

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to become true AIs, sentient
machines in the near future.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sandbox
scenario, what is that?

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: So a sandbox
is basically a safe place

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:90%
to do something.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you create
a sandbox world,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
think of it as
being a digital copy

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:84%
or model of our world, something
that an artificial organism

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:84%
or an uploaded
mind could inhabit.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And what you want to
do, if you create,

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:84%
let's say, an AI
or a world of AIs,

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:84%
you want to put them in an
isolated computer system that

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.750 align:middle line:84%
isn't network to anything
else to provide a safety

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:84%
barrier between the external
world and the sandbox world.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And so this would allow them
to live in this simulation.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:84%
You could present them
with problems or scenarios

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and see them work
out the results

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:90%
in a logical or useful manner.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
harvest that information

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.620 align:middle line:90%
and apply it to the real world.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the things to
consider is a sandbox

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.810 align:middle line:84%
can run 10, 100, 1,000
times faster than reality.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So for every second that
the sandbox is running,

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:84%
the mind in the sandbox would
experience about 16 minutes

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.200 align:middle line:90%
and 40 seconds.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you scared about
artificial intelligence?

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.980 align:middle line:10%
>>SHULTS: I have a very
cautionary feeling about it.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.470 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I've had a lot of
experience in the research

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.670 align:middle line:10%
and the operation.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And I can see that there are
definite, definite possible

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.500 align:middle line:90%
problems.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The sandbox scenario is one
way of isolating those problems

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:90%
if you're very, very careful.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.090 align:middle line:84%
You can never allow
the sandbox world

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
to be interfaced to
the real world any more

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
than a face-to-face
conversation.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't want any
digital input or output

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the world
because there could be hazards.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have hope for
the future with AI looming out

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.500 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Absolutely, I do
because there are many things

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that an artificial
intelligence running

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:84%
at a higher level of
intellectual capacity

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:90%
than a human could solve.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of issues that
we need solving in the world,

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:90%
and that could be a benefit.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:84%
They can also run much
faster and devote more time

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:84%
to that problem in a short
period compared to us.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
benefit to be seen from AI.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:90%
It can do a lot of the drudgery.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:84%
It solved the protein
solving problem

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:90%
and a number of other things.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.170 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, there are hazards.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to be
very, very cautious

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:84%
because an AI on the
loose could literally

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:84%
displace human thinking,
the human world.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In every aspect.

00:20:39.945 --> 00:20:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Pretty much, yes.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it, it would
find it didn't need.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.867 align:middle line:84%
Living on electrical
power and computing space,

00:20:45.867 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't need any
of the resources we do.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.617 align:middle line:90%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:57.095 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:10%
- Dr. Ray Kurzweil
envisions a day

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.410 align:middle line:10%
when you will go to
an electronics store,

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:10%
and you will have the
lens of your eye removed,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:10%
and it will be replaced
with a liquid that's

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:10%
packed with electronics,
and a camera, and a radio.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And you will be given
then super vision.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.440 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
see in the dark.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.070 align:middle line:90%
You'll have infrared vision.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.390 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to be wired
to the internet 24/7.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, with this super
vision comes super vision,

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.910 align:middle line:90%
and that's the problem.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, we're
talking about a different form

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.990 align:middle line:90%
of human.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:32.610 align:middle line:84%
They refer to these as
humanity 2.0 or transhumans.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And what people don't realize
is that the singularity

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and the skingularity-- when
this technology is enmeshed with

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.990 align:middle line:90%
our body--

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:84%
are not only running
parallel, they're

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:90%
actually the same thing.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
humans are going

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:84%
to be able to survive in the
new artificial intelligence

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:84%
environment of
the singularity is

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.648 align:middle line:90%
if we ourselves become machines.

00:21:52.648 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:84%
- Well, it's interesting
to talk about the phrase

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.860 align:middle line:90%
"singularity" in this context.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So AI people call
this the singularity

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.990 align:middle line:90%
for a very definite reason.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.540 align:middle line:84%
They liken it to the
physics of a black hole.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:84%
At the center of
a black hole, you

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.650 align:middle line:84%
have the singularity,
essentially

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:84%
a point of virtual
infinite density

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and infinite
gravitational power.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And in that type
of crazy physics,

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:84%
all of the physics that we
have don't seem to apply.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.300 align:middle line:10%
We don't know how to predict
things at the singularity.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.330 align:middle line:10%
And this is what AI
theorists are saying.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:10%
When computing intelligence
exceeds our own,

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.640 align:middle line:10%
we, human beings, will
not have the ability

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.270 align:middle line:10%
to predict the trajectory
of our civilization.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:10%
We're basically going to be
losing control over this car

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:10%
that we think we're driving.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's now the dominant
intelligence will be beyond us.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And what will that
dominant intelligence do?

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Will it merge with us as
Kurzweil thinks, a combination

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:84%
of human machine,
hybrid intelligence,

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.050 align:middle line:84%
where we'll be some
freakish bunch of creatures

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:84%
living for 500 years
and IQs of 1,000,

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.640 align:middle line:90%
totally unlike what we are?

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.797 align:middle line:84%
Or will the computers
think, humanity,

00:23:01.797 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:90%
let's pull a terminator on them?

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Or will they be our willing
slaves and make our world

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.260 align:middle line:90%
a paradise?

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's a singularity.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:84%
We can't really
predict any of this.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:84%
we raise a lot of questions,
and we raise a lot of dangers.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:84%
It's often been stated,
even biblically,

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that even a human

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:90%
didn't he?

But if you read the

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.980 align:middle line:84%
you discover the
reason Hal turned

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:84%
was because he was
being given conflicting

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.360 align:middle line:90%
sets of information.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Hal himself actually seemed
to be a very moral computer

in the context of the story.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:84%

understand, we ourselves

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
We ourselves reach
a state of confusion

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.685 align:middle line:84%
when we're given conflicted
sorts of goals or orders.

00:25:35.685 --> 00:25:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
the astronaut's name?

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Dave?

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Yes, it
was Dave Bowman.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think it
was Dave That's right.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Dave.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: [LAUGHS] Yep.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Take a stress pill, Dave.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Enrico Fermi was a
physicist and a darn good one.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And lots of things have
surrounded his career.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:90%
But what is the Fermi paradox?

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: OK, so
this is the issue.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.818 align:middle line:84%
Fermi and a number
of his friends

00:26:01.818 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:84%
who were working on nuclear
weaponry and research

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.480 align:middle line:84%
at the time often said the
universe is ripe for life

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.860 align:middle line:84%
to exist everywhere, and
there should be civilizations

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And we don't seem to
hear any signs of them.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.122 align:middle line:84%
And so one day Fermi,
without saying anything

00:26:18.122 --> 00:26:19.580 align:middle line:84%
really technical,
just blurted out,

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.080 align:middle line:90%
so where the heck are they?

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.137 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:26:22.137 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's right.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:23.887 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: He is right.

00:26:23.887 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:84%
The Fermi paradox got named
that because of his very simple

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:90%
question, where are they?

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I recently
taught a six-part course

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.723 align:middle line:90%
on the Fermi paradox.

00:26:34.723 --> 00:26:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
interesting.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:90%
We have radio telescopes--

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:84%
SETI, the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence--

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:90%
scanning the skies for years.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And they get some
tantalizing signals,

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.760 align:middle line:84%
but they discard them
because they don't repeat.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then it goes away.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.238 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: And, well, I mean,
if you're on a planet that has

00:26:50.238 --> 00:26:52.410 align:middle line:84%
17--hour day and we
have a 24-hour day,

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and those two don't sync
up again the next day--

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'll never get it.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: You'll never get
that second signal again.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.367 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
easy ways of dismissing.

00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:01.325 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
they're all looking

00:27:01.325 --> 00:27:03.200 align:middle line:84%
at what they call the
water hole frequencies,

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.550 align:middle line:90%
the hydroxyl frequencies.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:08.175 align:middle line:84%
But we have laws that
don't allow us to broadcast

00:27:08.175 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:90%
on those frequencies.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if they
use the same logic?

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.560 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't be
broadcasting on them,

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and the sky would
be silent there.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless,
the issue is this--

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:84%
we should have-- and
it's been estimated--

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
roughly three million
civilizations in this galaxy

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:25.950 align:middle line:90%
And we don't hear from them.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's two
things to consider.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:84%
If they're living in the grassy
plains, or building mud huts,

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.845 align:middle line:84%
or carving stone, and
don't have any electronics,

00:27:34.845 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to see laser
light or hear radio signals.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.803 align:middle line:84%
They could be as
smart as-- they could

00:27:38.803 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:84%
be in the Victorian
era, the steam era.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:84%
The other thing to
consider is this--

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.870 align:middle line:84%
there is a natural
force in our galaxy

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:84%
that could easily wipe
out civilizations.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:84%
We normally see about
50 supernovas per year

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:90%
in our galaxy alone.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And a supernova has
an explosion radius.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.310 align:middle line:84%
If one was nearby us, it could
wipe out all our technology

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:03.500 align:middle line:84%
or destroy life on Earth
depending on how close it was.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a radius
of about 50 light years

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.740 align:middle line:84%
as being your blast
radius of effect,

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.810 align:middle line:84%
a sphere with
50-light-year radius

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:90%
contains about 2,000 stars.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So when a supernova goes off,
it radiates roughly 2,000 stars.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:21.850 align:middle line:84%
50 supernovas means 100,000
stars in our galaxy per year

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.210 align:middle line:90%
get the effects of radiation--

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is just a blip.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.877 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: From
just a blip, right.

00:28:25.877 --> 00:28:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So in a millennium, you're
thinking, well, that's

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.210 align:middle line:90%
1,000 times more than that.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:35.330 align:middle line:84%
You would be having a
billion stars irradiated

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:90%
in 10,000 years.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Since the last ice age,
we'd have an immense number,

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:84%
billions of stars being wiped
out by supernova explosions.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And all it takes
is enough radiation

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.580 align:middle line:84%
to disrupt their electronics,
or turn part of their atmosphere

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.398 align:middle line:84%
to ozone, or wipe out
all life on their planet.

00:28:56.398 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they're all toast.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.273 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: And they're toast, or
they're back in the Stone Age.

00:29:00.273 --> 00:29:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where would we be with
one major solar coronal mass

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.130 align:middle line:90%
ejection right now?

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big trouble.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Yes.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.142 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've been
talking about that

00:29:08.142 --> 00:29:09.480 align:middle line:90%
on the radio show for years.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.522 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: That's correct.

00:29:10.522 --> 00:29:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We need to
protect our power grid,

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.348 align:middle line:90%
and it's not happening.

00:29:13.348 --> 00:29:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: And you know
what the easiest way

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:90%
to protect the power grid is?

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.740 align:middle line:90%
Don't have one.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything should
be distributed.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.520 align:middle line:84%
A distributed system has
independent multiple nodes--

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.788 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instead of a domino.

00:29:26.788 --> 00:29:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: --instead of
one gigantic antenna

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that's ready to get
killed in one hit.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Good point.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:90%
What about ET life?

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:34.700 align:middle line:90%
What's out there?

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: All right.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
the stuff of life

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
is everywhere in the universe,
and it's called Tholen.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And it forms just from radiation
from stars, ultraviolet light,

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.480 align:middle line:90%
heat, many different forces.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And we also see clouds of
these molecules in space.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So we know it's likely that
the most common life in space

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.390 align:middle line:84%
would probably be bacteria--
simple, hearty organisms that

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:90%
eat this stuff.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But every now and
then, you're going

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to have a planet that
lives well enough, long

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:84%
enough in benign
environmental conditions

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.020 align:middle line:90%
that things will develop.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And we see good signs
of that sort of stuff.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Even on Mars, there appear to
be fossil remains, although they

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.860 align:middle line:90%
don't talk about it.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that bacteria
should be everywhere.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And given enough time
and benign conditions,

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:84%
it's quite likely that
there's every sort of organism

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.080 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine living
somewhere in space.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And also consider what we
think of as life-supporting

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.670 align:middle line:90%
conditions on Earth--

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.800 align:middle line:90%
we're very human-centric.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.780 align:middle line:84%
We think of conditions like
this much oxygen, temperature,

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:90%
pressure.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But there are conditions
that would kill us instantly

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.290 align:middle line:84%
that would support a lot of
other life forms quite well.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can expect
billions of worlds

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:84%
with life that we wouldn't
be able to step foot

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.345 align:middle line:90%
on without dying.

00:30:48.345 --> 00:30:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
Drake equation.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.428 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Well, it is
the Drake equation.

00:30:51.428 --> 00:30:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And we have to recognize
that the parameters

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.540 align:middle line:84%
for the existence
of life are much

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.967 align:middle line:84%
broader than the parameters
that exist for human life.

00:30:58.967 --> 00:30:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we determine
where these signals

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.798 align:middle line:90%
are coming from out there?

00:31:05.798 --> 00:31:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Well, there are a
number of things we can do.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is you set up
a number of radio telescopes

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.690 align:middle line:84%
or a number of
infrared telescopes,

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.122 align:middle line:84%
and you use what's known as very
long baseline interferometry.

00:31:17.122 --> 00:31:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So the signals from
all of them are

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.700 align:middle line:84%
synchronized to extract
as much data as you can.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And it effectively gives you
a lens the size of the Earth.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And with that
resolution, we should

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.330 align:middle line:84%
be able to identify components
in the atmospheres of planets

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that look like the
exhaust of biology,

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.420 align:middle line:84%
like excess oxygen or certain
gases that might exist only

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.240 align:middle line:90%
from organisms' operation.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we could find
signals that way.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.362 align:middle line:90%
But here's another one.

00:31:43.362 --> 00:31:45.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we don't
have around our planet

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.075 align:middle line:84%
is orbital power stations
that harvest the sunlight,

00:31:49.075 --> 00:31:51.200 align:middle line:84%
turn it into microwaves,
and beam it to the ground.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Beams it
right down to us.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Right, orbital power.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, if a civilization
used orbital power,

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.870 align:middle line:84%
you can expect that an
array of satellites orbiting

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:84%
their planet would have
enough leakage or side

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.370 align:middle line:84%
lobes that we should
be able to detect

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:10.037 align:middle line:84%
a fairly strong synchronized
signal, even from here.

00:32:10.037 --> 00:32:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.662 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: So some things
we could look for.

00:32:12.662 --> 00:32:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 4,000 light
years away, there

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:18.510 align:middle line:84%
was a strange radio
signal emanating from it.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's check.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.310 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.550 align:middle line:10%
- Scientists have detected a
radio signal from somewhere

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:10%
out in deep space some
4,000 light years away.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:32.010 align:middle line:84%
The signal pulsed every
18 minutes and 18 seconds

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.540 align:middle line:90%
every time--

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:36.780 align:middle line:90%
18 minutes and 18 seconds.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:90%
It did this for three months.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Then it stopped.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Scientists assume it was a
naturally occurring rotating

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.470 align:middle line:84%
object that, like a
lighthouse shining its beacon,

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:52.800 align:middle line:84%
will send what appears
to be a repeating signal.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.560 align:middle line:10%
But Natasha Hurley
Walker, whose study

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.750 align:middle line:10%
into this repeating
signal was recently

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.780 align:middle line:10%
published in the journal
"Nature" told Vice,

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:04.770 align:middle line:10%
quote, "there are no models
that produce such bright radio

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:07.920 align:middle line:10%
emission from two objects
in orbit with each other,

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:10%
with such precision, and
any that would produce

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.520 align:middle line:10%
any kind of radio waves
would also produce X-ray

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.680 align:middle line:10%
emission, which we don't see."

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Some think this might be coming
from a highly magnetized star

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.380 align:middle line:90%
called a magnetar.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.970 align:middle line:10%
So what does this all mean?

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:30.500 align:middle line:10%
Astronomer and Gaia News
contributor, Marc Dantonio.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:35.240 align:middle line:10%
- Maybe this strange signal
is some weird kind of magnetar

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.920 align:middle line:10%
that is rotating.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're not used to seeing
it rotate every 18 minutes.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:84%
That means a rather
slow rotation.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.420 align:middle line:90%
So this is kind of weird.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.710 align:middle line:84%
It's something that doesn't
match any model that we know.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:10%
And I think that it takes
us down a new research path

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.920 align:middle line:10%
to try and figure out just
what it is we're looking at.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.080 align:middle line:84%
- If this signal is not
from some type of dead star,

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.667 align:middle line:90%
what else could it be?

00:34:02.667 --> 00:34:04.750 align:middle line:10%
- There is a remote chance--
there's a remote one,

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:10%
a far remote one-- that it's
a techno signature, maybe.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:10.989 align:middle line:10%
Now, what's a techno signature?

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:13.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a signature from
something intelligent

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:14.770 align:middle line:90%
that's beeping out something.

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, repeating bursts
like this, we always

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.010 align:middle line:84%
err on the side of caution
and say, well, the universe

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:21.639 align:middle line:90%
rotates.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Everything rotates.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.313 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it could
be something rotating

00:34:24.313 --> 00:34:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and flashing a hot side toward
us that has this signal in it

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.940 align:middle line:90%
like a hot spot.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So it could either
be something that's

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:34.600 align:middle line:84%
a techno signature
that's intelligent,

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.870 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a naturally
occurring, strange,

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:41.060 align:middle line:84%
exotic star or magnetar,
something along those lines.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:41.860 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What in the
world could it be?

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.703 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: [LAUGHS]
What out of the world?

00:34:46.703 --> 00:34:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Well,
there are a number

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.530 align:middle line:84%
of things that could
produce a signal like that.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy to go right
to an intelligent source.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's not out
of the question.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just so distant, and we
have so little information

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.030 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to say.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you had a cloud of gas,
for instance, orbiting the star

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and a beam of energy coming
from the star and exciting it,

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.800 align:middle line:84%
obviously, it could
produce radio waves.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.610 align:middle line:84%
We've seen things
similar to that.

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:16.540 align:middle line:84%
But the statement about
it probably also producing

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.740 align:middle line:90%
X-rays--

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.550 align:middle line:84%
in most cases,
that would be true.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.430 align:middle line:84%
So it could be a new
phenomenon, something

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:22.510 align:middle line:90%
we're not familiar with.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.580 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
technical signature.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It could be something
very prosaic,

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.730 align:middle line:90%
and we're missing something.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.775 align:middle line:84%
I won't discount intelligence
because, in my mind,

00:35:30.775 --> 00:35:33.025 align:middle line:84%
there has to be a lot of
intelligence in the universe.

00:35:33.025 --> 00:35:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you and I
first met on the radio,

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.330 align:middle line:90%
we talked about Mars anomalies.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Yes.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's your
take on Mars these days?

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: To me,
it's very obvious.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Earth and Mars both formed
from the same materials

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.340 align:middle line:84%
in the same solar
system at the same time.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And you would expect that
many of the conditions

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:90%
would be the same.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.870 align:middle line:90%
They're both terrestrial worlds.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And the formation of
atmospheres, water,

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.810 align:middle line:84%
petroleum-- those processes
occur in the molten

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
magma in the planet
and then exit

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:90%
to the surface of the planet.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:06.262 align:middle line:84%
That's where our oceans and
petroleum all came from.

00:36:06.262 --> 00:36:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Similar processes should
have happened on Mars.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Abiotic oil.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Absolutely.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And actually, some of the
subsurface radar scans

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.540 align:middle line:84%
appear to indicate
occlusions underground

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:90%
that might be salt domes.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.220 align:middle line:84%
That would be very consistent
with the oceanic environment

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.430 align:middle line:84%
being generated by
chemistry and magma.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:27.220 align:middle line:84%
We also do know the whole
North Pole of the planet

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.710 align:middle line:84%
was covered in an
ocean at one time,

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and there were
oceans all over Mars.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And they dried up
quite a while ago.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Most people, particularly in
higher research organizations,

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:40.180 align:middle line:84%
say the water went away four
billion or two billion years

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.100 align:middle line:84%
ago and wasn't a
chance for anything

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.020 align:middle line:90%
to grow there or live there.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that's wrong, that
the planet is presently

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.440 align:middle line:90%
in an ice age.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And we see signs of that
from the Mars Polar Lander.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.110 align:middle line:84%
It found ice only a couple
of inches under the soil.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And we often see
slope streaks forming

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:58.180 align:middle line:84%
in craters where this ice is
apparently melting and flowing

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.060 align:middle line:90%
as water.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's very clear
to me, Mars was

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:04.000 align:middle line:84%
a smaller world than the Earth,
less gravity, less volcanism.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.220 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't regenerate
its atmosphere the way

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.470 align:middle line:84%
our volcanoes on Earth
regenerate our own.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And being in an ice age
with the oceans frozen,

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.630 align:middle line:90%
well, the air gets lost.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:14.830 align:middle line:90%
It gets very thin.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:17.345 align:middle line:84%
But one thing
stands in its favor.

00:37:17.345 --> 00:37:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that?

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Organisms can live
in water even in a near vacuum.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: And so the water
acts as a surrogate atmosphere.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:84%
We were involved in some of the
research done on samples back

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:31.980 align:middle line:90%
from the moon.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And the Johnson Space
Flight Center many years ago

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:38.040 align:middle line:84%
did research, and they took
small cold-blooded animals

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and dropped them down to a
tenth of an atmosphere, 1.5

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.020 align:middle line:90%
pounds of pressure.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And they survived after
adapting quite well.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So there were fish, and
reptiles, and other things

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.910 align:middle line:84%
that lived in just a tenth of
the atmosphere our planet has.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:54.250 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
adapt and thrive.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
some of these Mars images.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.175 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Absolutely.

00:37:57.175 --> 00:37:59.342 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us what we're
looking at, Sir Charles.

00:37:59.342 --> 00:38:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Here's our first one.

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.175 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: OK, so what I'd
like to show you in figure 1--

00:38:03.175 --> 00:38:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll start
up there in the corner.

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:05.545 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Absolutely.

00:38:05.545 --> 00:38:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So figure 1 shows what
is clearly dry sand.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.740 align:middle line:84%
You can see a print made by
the Mossbauer spectrometer

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:13.540 align:middle line:90%
on the left.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.300 align:middle line:10%
And then the next day, you
see that it has worn away.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:19.720 align:middle line:84%
This is day-by-day erosion
that we have a track of.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty fast.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: It is.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And you see they
take numerous frames

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.480 align:middle line:84%
of the same area over many
days on Mars, or SOLs,

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.280 align:middle line:90%
as they're called.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And we can see the rate
that change is occurring.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:32.440 align:middle line:84%
In figure 2, you
see a stretch of mud

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.440 align:middle line:84%
before and after the Mossbauer
head was pressed into it,

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and you see that
ring-shaped print.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:43.400 align:middle line:10%
The closeup in figure 4
shows a trail in the mud--

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.460 align:middle line:10%
and it does appear to
be mud on the left.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.710 align:middle line:10%
On the right, that
trail has altered

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.560 align:middle line:10%
as if some water or some
liquid has flowed over it

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.748 align:middle line:10%
in the course of the night.

00:38:51.748 --> 00:38:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when
you say mud, we're

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:90%
talking about wet, soggy mud.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Wet, soggy mud.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.360 align:middle line:90%
So look at the ring print.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.640 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
the figure 5, I've

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:84%
colorized an outline to
show that it is exactly

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:03.880 align:middle line:90%
the same area.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:84%
The patterns in
the spherules prove

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that it is the same area just
from two different photos.

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:13.660 align:middle line:10%
In figure 6, at the bottom, you
see a dark area in the ring.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.627 align:middle line:10%
That is where the mud
stuck to the Mossbauer.

00:39:15.627 --> 00:39:16.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's enhanced, right?

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:17.305 align:middle line:10%
>>SHULTS: Yes.

00:39:17.305 --> 00:39:19.045 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Figure 6 is 5 enhanced?

00:39:19.045 --> 00:39:20.020 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:20.820 align:middle line:10%
>>SHULTS: Yep.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.710 align:middle line:10%
So figure 6 shows you
where the mud bulges.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:26.500 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't flow like
sand in figure 1.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Figure 7 shows where the mud
is sticking on the instrument.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:90%
My contention is very simple.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:35.813 align:middle line:84%
Dry sand does not stick to
a plate of dry aluminum.

00:39:35.813 --> 00:39:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: And that
print is an exact mirror

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.290 align:middle line:84%
image of the mud that
peeled out of that print.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:45.340 align:middle line:84%
This shows water had to
flow within a 24-hour period

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.690 align:middle line:84%
in order to make that
change in the mud.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And it also shows
that it must indeed

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:84%
be wet because the
bulging you see

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.450 align:middle line:84%
there is totally different
from the print in the sand.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the most important
part about these images.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.790 align:middle line:84%
We know that these
features are being

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:05.310 align:middle line:90%
eroded on a day-by-day basis.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So these features
must not be new.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.410 align:middle line:90%
They had to be created recently.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which means
the planet is alive--

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: It is wet.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and wet.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.192 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: That's correct.

00:40:15.192 --> 00:40:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
many, many-- there

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.350 align:middle line:84%
are thousands of
images showing what

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:21.500 align:middle line:84%
appears to be the change from
liquid water in the course

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.690 align:middle line:90%
of two to five days.

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And NASA does not embrace
this or even discuss

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:30.620 align:middle line:84%
this, which is amazing
to me because the signs

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.350 align:middle line:84%
of the physics and the
chemistry are very, very

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:36.530 align:middle line:84%
consistent with one thing,
and that's liquid water.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have spotted
fossils on Mars, haven't you?

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.362 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Indeed, indeed.

00:40:40.362 --> 00:40:41.528 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:40:41.528 --> 00:40:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Well, and
here's the thing.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.260 align:middle line:84%
If you find one
anomalous thing that

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.620 align:middle line:84%
looks like a shell, or an
urchin, or a trilobite,

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.990 align:middle line:84%
you think, well,
maybe random erosion

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:90%
produced an odd feature.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once, which
happens, which happens.

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Right.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:59.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you find five,
or 30, or 1,000 of them,

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:01.527 align:middle line:84%
you know that erosion
is a random force.

00:41:01.527 --> 00:41:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scattered
all over the place.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: Exactly.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.180 align:middle line:84%
You're literally crunching
on them under your feet.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And I had one
fellow from NASA who

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.178 align:middle line:84%
objected it, says there's
no place in the world

00:41:10.178 --> 00:41:12.470 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth where there's
life that you'd walk around

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.845 align:middle line:84%
and crunch on
fossils everywhere.

00:41:13.845 --> 00:41:14.750 align:middle line:90%
And I objected.

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, I live in
Florida, and there's limestone

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.230 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere you
walk, you're crunching.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you pick
up off the ground,

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.102 align:middle line:84%
you pick up a crinoid stem,
or a sea biscuit, or a shell.

00:41:26.102 --> 00:41:28.310 align:middle line:84%
it's no different on Mars
in these areas they landed.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:31.430 align:middle line:84%
They're all dried, saline
environments-- oceans

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:32.300 align:middle line:90%
and lakes.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about the
possibility of life on Mars.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at a
report from Gaia News.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.020 align:middle line:90%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.150 align:middle line:84%
- The final transmission
from the Mars Pathfinder

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:44.460 align:middle line:90%
was on September 27, 1997.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.060 align:middle line:84%
But the data it provided
helped scientists

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.060 align:middle line:84%
to conclude Mars was
once wet and warm.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.400 align:middle line:10%
And rounded rocks on
the surface indicate

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.770 align:middle line:10%
they may have been worn
down by running water.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:42:00.140 align:middle line:10%
And if there was water,
there could have been life.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Flash forward to today,
NASA's Perseverance Rover,

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.310 align:middle line:84%
on the red planet
since February of 2021,

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:10.220 align:middle line:84%
is tasked with finding
past or present life

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and seeing if humans could one
day explore or colonize Mars.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.820 align:middle line:10%
Perseverance is
collecting samples

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:20.930 align:middle line:10%
to determine if they contain
any fossils of ancient martians.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But a new study led by
Alexander Pavlov, a space

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:29.330 align:middle line:84%
scientist at NASA, says they
might have to dig a lot deeper.

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Pavlov argues that amino acids
could be the best evidence

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.270 align:middle line:90%
of any past life on Mars.

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:37.850 align:middle line:10%
But after millions of
years of radiation,

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.040 align:middle line:10%
all those amino
acids on the surface

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.780 align:middle line:10%
would have been
destroyed, writing, quote,

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.860 align:middle line:10%
"Our experimental results
suggest serious challenges

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.320 align:middle line:10%
for the search of
ancient amino acids

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.100 align:middle line:10%
and other potential organic
biosignatures in the top 2

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.170 align:middle line:10%
meters of the martian surface."

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:58.160 align:middle line:84%
2 meters, or roughly 7
feet, but Perseverance

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.480 align:middle line:90%
can only dig a few inches.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.790 align:middle line:10%
However, Pavlov told
vicenews.com, quote,

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:07.880 align:middle line:10%
"Microcraters are
common on Mars.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.280 align:middle line:10%
Small impactors
can excavate rocks

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.350 align:middle line:10%
from several meters of depth.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:16.070 align:middle line:10%
Cosmic rays are significantly
reduced by 2-meter depth

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:20.370 align:middle line:10%
into a rock and do not
penetrate at all below 4 meters.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:23.000 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, an ejecta
from such depths

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.700 align:middle line:10%
would have small exposure
time to cosmic rays

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.870 align:middle line:10%
and thus, may contain the
primordial unaltered amino

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:32.750 align:middle line:10%
acids from billions
of years ago."

25 years of humans studying
the surface of Mars,

and we have learned so much.

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:41.580 align:middle line:10%
But as Pavlov
concluded in his study,

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.320 align:middle line:10%
we have only scratched the
surface of this problem.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.800 align:middle line:84%
But with every problem
comes the opportunity

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.540 align:middle line:90%
to figure out a solution.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps this will
help us find life on Mars.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What amazing
technology, Sir Charles.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.680 align:middle line:90%
What does that tell you?

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.097 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Well,
it tells me a lot.

00:43:59.097 --> 00:44:02.800 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot more techniques
and hardware at their disposal

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.030 align:middle line:90%
to do the analysis.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
stands clearly in my mind

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:10.610 align:middle line:84%
is that it was
about 46 years ago

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:14.440 align:middle line:84%
the last time we sent
a biological detection

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.670 align:middle line:90%
package to Mars.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And in all that time--
and there was two of them

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.240 align:middle line:90%
on Viking 1 and 2.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Ever since then, we
have never yet sent

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.720 align:middle line:84%
another biological
detection package.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.220 align:middle line:84%

that says they're not

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.210 align:middle line:90%
looking very seriously.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the major assumptions
they always seem to make

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.990 align:middle line:84%
is they would only be
looking for microbes.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they're dismissing
some pretty glaring examples

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:41.890 align:middle line:84%
of what appears to be
macro-sized fossils.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fish?

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:47.260 align:middle line:84%

sea urchins, sand dollars,

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:52.670 align:middle line:90%
crinoids.

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:53.470 align:middle line:90%

the hope that we

a number of caves

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.918 align:middle line:84%
and a number of
subsurface lakes.

00:45:08.918 --> 00:45:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And so some of those things
would still be alive today,

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:13.150 align:middle line:84%
which also brings us
to a cautionary note.

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:16.090 align:middle line:84%
We know that they're planning
to send human astronauts to Mars

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.130 align:middle line:84%
at some point in the
very near future.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:20.170 align:middle line:84%
We have to be cautious
because if there

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:23.030 align:middle line:84%
are any organisms surviving
on the planet at all,

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.630 align:middle line:84%
it could provide a
real biological threat

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:27.280 align:middle line:90%
to any people who arrive there.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.230 align:middle line:84%
We would have
absolutely no resistance

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:31.185 align:middle line:84%
to any alien
organism, particularly

00:45:31.185 --> 00:45:32.560 align:middle line:84%
if the biochemistry
is different.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they could
bring it back here.

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:35.762 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: Well, and
that's the other thing.

00:45:35.762 --> 00:45:37.720 align:middle line:10%
The talk about bringing
samples back I think

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.490 align:middle line:10%
is one of the greatest
foolish things

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:10%
we've ever discussed because
it's like putting polio

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.380 align:middle line:10%
blankets in a medical ward.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.480 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
get any benefit out

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.600 align:middle line:84%
of this if something
gets out of the lab.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scary times.

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:52.037 align:middle line:90%
>>SHULTS: It is, indeed.

00:45:52.037 --> 00:45:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that
the best thing for us

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.870 align:middle line:84%
to do in analyzing this is to
send life-detecting packages

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:02.055 align:middle line:84%
before we send any human
life there and do not

00:46:02.055 --> 00:46:04.180 align:middle line:84%
bring the samples back
because we really don't have

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.530 align:middle line:90%
secure confinement for them.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sir Charles, thank you
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS: It's been a
real pleasure, George.

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for inviting me.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is your website?

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SHULTS:
Shultslaboratories.com.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spell that out.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:21.648 align:middle line:10%
>>SHULTS: S-H-U-L-T-S
L-A-B-O-R-A-T-O-R-I-E-S .com.

00:46:21.648 --> 00:46:22.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Thank you again.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:23.470 align:middle line:10%
>>SHULTS: You're very welcome.

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:24.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:27.790 align:middle line:10%
I've known Sir Charles Shults
III for a number of years.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:32.810 align:middle line:10%
And every time I talk to him, it
gets more and more interesting

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:34.010 align:middle line:10%
and exciting.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
