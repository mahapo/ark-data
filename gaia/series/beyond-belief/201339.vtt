00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:24.488 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief".

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.988 align:middle line:10%
You know, there are
people on this planet

00:00:27.988 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:10%
who just go with the herd.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:10%
And then there are others who
question the herd, the group.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'd like to be joined by
forensic engineer and scientist

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Judy Wood.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
She has been seeking the
truth for more than 20 years.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.475 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Wood, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief".

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDY WOOD: Well, thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how is Judy?

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Doing better.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can't believe
so many years have gone

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.170 align:middle line:90%
by since 9/11, this tragedy.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it continues to
change and evolve, doesn't it?

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a big effect on humanity.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:10%
And if 9/11 hadn't
happened, I used

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:10%
to say it was an attack
on human consciousness,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:10%
and it made people
brain damaged.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It did.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.447 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Fear-based mind control.

00:01:16.447 --> 00:01:18.780 align:middle line:84%
That if that hadn't happened,
what's happened since then

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.268 align:middle line:84%
would not have
been able to occur.

00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
still hasn't stopped.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, we're
still in Afghanistan.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:90%
We're still in Iraq.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:90%
These things haven't stopped.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And every
9/11, each year,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.150 align:middle line:84%
you get a booster
shot of the PSYOPs.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.408 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: So people won't start
thinking for themselves.

00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you, Judy?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:90%
You don't let this story go.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: What kind of world
do I want to live in?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.570 align:middle line:10%
And what kind of world do I want
my fellow humans to live in?

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It's great to be
in an area where

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:84%
you can do what you want to do
when you want to do it and be

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:90%
responsible for yourself.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.980 align:middle line:84%
If you want to grow
chickens, you can.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go
hiking, you can.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go play
basketball, you can.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
You're not told what
to do, when to do it.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:90%
But that's changing.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's review just
for a little bit, Judy.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.593 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
talk about some new issues

00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:90%
with this tragedy.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:84%
But the official story is
that four planes were hijacked

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and two hit the World
Trade Center towers.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Another hit the Pentagon.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And another one crashed in
Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.765 align:middle line:84%
It did not reach its
originated target.

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I think we may have
shot that one down.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.473 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: As the story goes.

00:02:37.473 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion,
what do you think's going on?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.020 align:middle line:10%
Because you've
written a book about,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:10%
you know, where have
the towers gone.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --"Where Did the
Towers Go?", there it is.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And that's the
question that people

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:90%
should have been asking.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.577 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you see
to do this kind of research?

00:02:55.577 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Where did the rubble go?

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
we saw the planes.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The planes did
hit the buildings.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:90%
We saw things like that.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We saw what we
thought could be planes,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:84%
but planes don't turn
buildings into powder

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
in midair, whether real
planes and fake planes.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.512 align:middle line:84%
The buildings turned
into powder in midair.

00:03:09.512 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Most of the buildings
turn to powder in midair.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like demolition?

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: No, those turn
buildings into chunks.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Controlled demolition
blows chunks, not powder.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.303 align:middle line:10%
And you could see a chunk
falling and just trailing dust

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:10%
until it runs out of dust, never
hitting the ground because it's

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.407 align:middle line:10%
just all dust.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're watching
this, right, on television?

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're saying,
there's something wrong here.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And the worst
day of my life was 9/11.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.967 align:middle line:84%
In the faculty conference room,
I was looking at the TV screen.

00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was watching it.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, you guys
aren't buying this?

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.618 align:middle line:84%
I mean, something
weird is going on here.

00:03:43.618 --> 00:03:45.500 align:middle line:84%
See this building
frothing up into dust.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at me like, what
kind of a wacko did we hire?

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.270 align:middle line:90%
Am I insane?

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Or is the rest of world insane?

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So I went up to my
office, and that's

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:84%
when I came up with a
billiard ball analogy.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And I end up showing
it to a colleague.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And I asked, is this right?

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.838 align:middle line:90%
And he said, of course, it is.

00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:90%
Are you having a senior moment?

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.965 align:middle line:84%
This was like, you
know, kids play.

00:04:03.965 --> 00:04:04.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And then I applied
it to 9/11, suddenly,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:90%
his brain locked up.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
That's when I knew there was
some weird effect on majority

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
remember the first time

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.440 align:middle line:84%
you were on "Coast
To Coast" with us,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.899 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about these
buildings collapsing.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking
about your theories.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I, even for a moment,
sat back and went, whoa,

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.735 align:middle line:90%
where did this come from?

00:04:24.735 --> 00:04:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It wasn't a theory.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Like this book is all evidence.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have to
revise anything of it.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:90%
You can't disprove facts.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And so there's nothing
in there to disprove.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe in looking
at the evidence

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and following the evidence
because it's so critical.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And one thing you
said way back then

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:84%
was, well, you know,
what would this be about?

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing if you
want to take over the US,

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:84%
you don't go in the front
door because the US military

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:90%
will come get you.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: You poof the towers.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what I call it.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Not really clouds.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Poof it into dust.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you get people fighting
about his fault, his fault,

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:84%
his fault. You get people
fighting with each other.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they hate the
government so badly

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.130 align:middle line:84%
they want any government
but the one they have.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.338 align:middle line:84%
Then you walk in the front
door, and they welcome you

00:05:09.338 --> 00:05:10.182 align:middle line:90%
with open arms.

00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They beg you--

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --to help them.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And that's what I
fear is coming to fruition.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:84%
After all these
years, anything new?

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.577 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Not really with 9/11.

00:05:20.577 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the facts
are still the facts.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
The building turning
mostly into dust in midair.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.450 align:middle line:90%
There is really gruesome stuff.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's not needed
to see what happened.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
still a controversy

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:84%
about building seven that
got hit with some rubble,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:84%
but not enough to see it
collapse like the other two.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Oh, even
that, NIST folks even

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.510 align:middle line:84%
acknowledged that
there wasn't enough,

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.100 align:middle line:84%
even when the towers one
and two each 500,000 tons

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:84%
went away, that there
wasn't enough of an impact

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to cause any disruption in
the gas lines underground.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That should ask you--

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Buildings just
don't go down like that.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, it was
turning dust all afternoon.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.525 align:middle line:84%
You see all the material
pouring out of it all afternoon.

based upon these findings,

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
that the collapse of WTC Seven
was a global failure involving

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.450 align:middle line:84%
the near simultaneous failure
of all columns in the building.

>>WOOD: It's not simultaneous.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And here, they just
discovered that it

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.263 align:middle line:84%
was a near simultaneous failure
of all columns in the building.

00:07:55.263 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't do that with
controlled demolition.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:84%
They get key columns that will
cause things to collapse in.

this is the first time

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:90%
You don't care--

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't care.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --as long as
the cell phone works.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: But you need both.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's an example
of interference.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.390 align:middle line:90%
That you need both signals.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you have, let's say,
John Hutchison's work,

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle line:84%
you have a static
field and interfere

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%
within that radio frequency
signals, weird things happen.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, in your book,
"Where Did the Towers Go?"

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:84%
when you first came out with
it, there were several camps.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
One was Dr. Judy
Wood is right on.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
other camp that said,

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.840 align:middle line:90%
what is she talking about?

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Has the perception
of what you've

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
done since you wrote this
book changed a little bit more

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
in the favor of
what you've said?

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.902 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, yeah.

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:16.110 align:middle line:90%
None have gone the other way.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you want
to run a cover-up,

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
you have to have several doors
for people to go through.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And you keep them busy
looking at those doors.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Like if you don't like
the lie behind door number

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.618 align:middle line:84%
one, the official
story, they'll show you

00:12:29.618 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:90%
the lie behind door number two.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Thermite
bombs in the building.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
like that, well, we

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:84%
have the super duper
new improved thermite.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they're
doing is to occupy you

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:84%
from turning around and
looking at the wide open field

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
of evidence behind you
and thinking for yourself.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's taken
some people a while

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to get out of the mindset,
to get out of door number

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.300 align:middle line:90%
two or three.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And once they do, oh my gosh,
and they see what's going on.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is a trick that works
with about anything, including

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:90%
card tricks.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:84%
They get people looking
elsewhere or focusing elsewhere

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.117 align:middle line:90%
and asking the wrong questions.

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when they
talk about government

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.350 align:middle line:84%
being involved in
this, I think there's

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.565 align:middle line:90%
a different group out there.

00:13:09.565 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I call it the crew.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:11.545 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The crew.

00:13:11.545 --> 00:13:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You don't have
to identify who it is.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me
tell you, when we

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:84%
saw the picture of
President George Bush, when

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.610 align:middle line:90%
he was in that classroom.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And somebody came up to me and
whispered what had happened,

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:90%
he was like totally dumbfounded.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He didn't
know what was going on.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He wasn't part of this.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:84%
There's something else afoot
here to create the illusion.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:35.612 align:middle line:90%
And here we are.

00:13:35.612 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Remember what I said?

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.230 align:middle line:84%
If you want to take over the
country or all countries,

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.970 align:middle line:84%
you get them fighting
amongst themselves.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you walk
in the front door,

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and they welcome
you with open arms.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.990 align:middle line:90%
You don't do it immediately.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.690 align:middle line:90%
You don't do a direct hit.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
brilliant scheme.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Understanding
human nature.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And you also make sure
they have doors one, two,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:90%
and three to pick from.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it scare you that
things like this can happen?

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But our life is,
you know, to me,

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.400 align:middle line:90%
life is a set of experiences.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.962 align:middle line:84%
So I've had more life
than about anybody I know.

00:14:09.962 --> 00:14:11.170 align:middle line:90%
And we're along for the ride.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.030 align:middle line:84%
We're here to learn
from our surroundings.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And just burying your head in
the sand, what good is that?

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:90%
You don't learn anything.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there any other
officials or organizations that

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.010 align:middle line:90%
agree with you based on this?

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.493 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: They can't afford to.

00:14:27.493 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'd lose
it all, don't they?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And you also look
at who's allowed

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:90%
to say what in the media.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, all the talk
of chem trails.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:84%
People notice these
marks in the sky.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they're introduced
this term of chem trails.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And then that becomes
OK to talk about.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
That's lie behind
door number two.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
that can't be what

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:84%
the deal is because they're
allowed to talk about it.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.885 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The people
who are assassinated

00:14:55.885 --> 00:14:57.410 align:middle line:90%
for talking about it.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's other things
that I've noticed,

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:04.060 align:middle line:84%
you know, physical examples
that would compare to that,

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:84%
like air handling system
for a big office building.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.870 align:middle line:84%
When the air comes through
the intake into the filter,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:90%
they put a static charge on it.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And that gets the particles
to stick into bigger particles

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:84%
to get trapped in the
mechanical filter.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have
this static environment.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Static charge
the environment.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And the airplane flies through
it with pressure changes.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it causes
the contaminants

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:84%
in the air to stick together
and then precipitate out.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want you to
look at what might actually

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:90%
be going on.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:84%
They give you a placebo to
hang on to so you stop looking.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has your belief
system affected your career

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Has there been--

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, for sure.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --any fallout for you?

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, for sure.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was
a one-way ticket.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
not backing down?

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: No.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I first
brought this up to my mom,

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:84%
it was around 2004, saying I
got to start talking about this.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, if you
do, you'll lose your career.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.360 align:middle line:90%
You won't have a job.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.793 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, if
I don't, no one will.

00:16:06.793 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:90%
And look where we are.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
why you did this?

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It had to get done.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To go
forward with this?

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you
could have stayed quiet.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, yeah.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know?

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, and I had up to
that point because I thought,

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.728 align:middle line:84%
OK, the grown ups are
going to take care of it.

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.183 align:middle line:90%
And I'll do my work and my job.

00:16:20.183 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I started seeing
that the grown ups weren't

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.392 align:middle line:90%
going to take care of it.

00:16:23.392 --> 00:16:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And then, whose job is
it to take care of it?

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:90%
It's ours.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:90%
It's our planet.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I needed to
start talking about it.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
think this was concocted?

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: If somebody wants
to control the planet,

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:84%
they can do a whole lot
of different things.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.538 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
lot of technologies

00:16:41.538 --> 00:16:43.210 align:middle line:90%
that we aren't told about.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And I like to use realistic
examples to show that.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Tornadoes.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if somebody
weaponized a tornado?

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:50.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:16:50.903 --> 00:16:51.716 align:middle line:90%
And directionally--

00:16:51.716 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --could control it.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Or a hurricane.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Which they may.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.502 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:16:57.502 --> 00:16:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, yeah.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.770 align:middle line:84%
After all, this a category
three hurricane moving

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.829 align:middle line:90%
towards Manhattan on 9/11.

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't warn anybody.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Why would they not warn anybody?

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.349 align:middle line:84%
Were they 100% sure of
where it was going to go?

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What gives credence to
some of the things you've said,

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
when you look back
to the Vietnam War,

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.355 align:middle line:84%
the Gulf of Tonkin,
in those days--

00:17:21.355 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They could
control the weather.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.869 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --they
controlled everything.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And for Americans to think our
government would make this up.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Or somebody
somewhere would.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.943 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or somebody
within government

00:17:31.943 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
would make up this story to
get us involved in a war.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Nah.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:90%
That couldn't be.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, subsequently, we found out
that's exactly what they did.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:90%
It's criminal.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:90%
And they know how people work.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And people are willing
to give up their freedoms

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.220 align:middle line:90%
if you scare them enough.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these people,
whoever they may be--

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Or creatures or
whatever you want to call them.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.612 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --do they think
we're naive and stupid?

00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That a lot of people
like to follow the herd,

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that that becomes
more important.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.155 align:middle line:84%
You can look up ask
conformity experiments.

00:18:06.155 --> 00:18:07.780 align:middle line:84%
If people are willing
to give the wrong

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:84%
answer just to be able to
blend in with everyone else.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.957 align:middle line:84%
Like, someone might say
that two times two is five.

00:18:13.957 --> 00:18:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, another group says it six.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.793 align:middle line:90%
Another group says it's seven.

00:18:16.793 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Hmm, you know there's more
people that say it's six.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'll say it's six.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And they stop using
their own brains.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So people get a lot of
their information these days,

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.568 align:middle line:84%
Judy, from mainstream
media, from the mainstream.

00:18:28.568 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to think they
listen to "Coast to Coast"

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.487 align:middle line:90%
and get the inside information.

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:33.820 align:middle line:90%
But they get it from mainstream.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.002 align:middle line:90%
Is that dangerous for them?

00:18:36.002 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They're told what
their thoughts should

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:90%
be, rather than just observe.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, like on 9/11,
why was every single TV

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.032 align:middle line:90%
station airing the same story?

00:18:50.032 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: In unison.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:90%
And non-stop.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
herd mentality.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And each 9/11 each year,
we're reminded of it.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.990 align:middle line:84%
So like a booster shot of the
PSYOP Instead of just looking,

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:84%
can't you see these buildings
turn into powder in midair?

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:90%
You know, coming down?

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And look at other
pieces of information,

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:18.480 align:middle line:84%
like building seven made a
0.6 on the Richter scale.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:90%
That's like a snowfall.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know,
like the JFK assassination,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:84%
we continue to wonder
what really happened.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.795 align:middle line:90%
What did we really know?

00:19:27.795 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's another case
where things have been just

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:90%
swept right under the carpet.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:34.202 align:middle line:84%
And people just
move on, assuming

00:19:34.202 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to follow-up.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to investigate.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:90%
And we don't forget it.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every year
on the radio show,

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
we do a JFK anniversary
and things like that.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.058 align:middle line:84%
Do they do they think
that we are foolish?

00:19:47.058 --> 00:19:48.725 align:middle line:84%
And that we're not
going to investigate?

00:19:48.725 --> 00:19:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, doesn't it show?

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:10%
Pretty much the
majority of the people

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:10%
will follow along with whatever
the TV is feeding them.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: And where do they
get their information from?

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:10%
But I have realized that,
like, the truthers that

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.320 align:middle line:10%
would promote bombs in
the building or whatnot,

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.290 align:middle line:10%
why that was so effective.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.862 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
cover something up,

00:20:09.862 --> 00:20:12.070 align:middle line:84%
you know that people are
going to be asking questions

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.550 align:middle line:84%
So you make an organization
someplace for them to go.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:90%
I call it a collection agency.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:90%
And then people are with others.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And they think that they're
on target going someplace.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:84%
But with all of these
things, something common

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:84%
is with a scientific
investigation,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:84%
you must first
determine what happened.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Before you can
say how it happened.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or why.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You have to figure
out what it was that happened,

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:84%
or who did it, and
why they did it.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you have people
arguing about how it happened,

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:90%
who did it.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.460 align:middle line:84%
It forces you to
assume what it was.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it works.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what card tricks are.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Was it building seven
that got you to think of this?

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.543 align:middle line:10%
Or was it the overall thing?

00:20:56.543 --> 00:20:57.960 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Oh, just
stuff in general,

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:10%
because being a scientist
and an experimentalist,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:10%
I rely on data.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
The empirical evidence is the
truth that theory must mimic.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Not the other way around.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:90%
Evidence.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.235 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why, you
just look at evidence.

00:21:12.235 --> 00:21:16.922 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important to
start from that direction

00:21:16.922 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:90%
and have a lot of discipline.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to speculate and
to jump to conclusions.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:84%
But to determine what
happened is so vital.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
examples of that.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And if people start relying
on models, then garbage in,

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:90%
garbage out.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there stories
that the media and authorities

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.050 align:middle line:84%
continue to spin on us
that we just fall for?

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Obviously.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Obviously.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Like the recent
events in the news.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Viruses, for example.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, we're
told to stay at home.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I actually
have a good example

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.730 align:middle line:84%
of why you must
first determine what

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.980 align:middle line:84%
happened before you
jump to anything else,

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
because you'll not
solve the real problem.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:90%
You'll assume a wrong problem.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:90%
I have a quote by Bill Gates.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:84%
It was the 31st of March
in "The Washington Post".

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.013 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of 2020?

00:22:15.013 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, of 2020.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: See if you can
spot the game plan here.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:84%
First, we need a consistent
nationwide approach

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:90%
to shutting down.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Despite urging from
public health experts,

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:84%
some states and counties
haven't shut down completely.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.100 align:middle line:84%
In some states,
beaches are still open

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and restaurants are still
serving sit down meals.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.230 align:middle line:90%
You notice the trickery?

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:90%
That first statement.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:84%
First, we need a consistent
nationwide approach

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:90%
to shutting down.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.437 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:22:43.437 --> 00:22:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Not ask if we
should or shouldn't.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just do it.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.773 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, do it.

00:22:46.773 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And then he starts
focusing on details.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.968 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they've done it.

00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I think all
the states governors

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
were so petrified that they were
doing the wrong thing that they

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:90%
had the jump on the bandwagon.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't stop and
decide what's going

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.310 align:middle line:90%
to happen if we shut down.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.185 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen
if we don't shut down.

00:23:02.185 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:84%
What are the ramifications
of all these things.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:90%
No, they just shut down.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back in 2019,
there were major fires

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.120 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:84%
We've got some
pictures from NASA that

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:90%
shows how extreme they are.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at these, Judy.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the change
because of the fires, right?

00:23:30.197 --> 00:23:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of questions
we need to ask ourself.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And first, determine
what happened, instead

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:84%

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:90%

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:84%

has changed in this aspect.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.302 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And in the
Pacific Northwest,

00:23:52.302 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I remember going on
hikes and so forth

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:90%
and coming upon fire towers.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:10%
The lumber companies had to
protect their investment.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.902 align:middle line:84%
And they had people
manning the fire towers.

00:24:01.902 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's a fire tower?

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's a lookout tower so
you can see all the way around.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.450 align:middle line:84%
See, oh, there's some
smoke over there.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's go see.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get it fast.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, get it fast.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, the national
parks and so forth,

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:84%
the national land,
lumber companies

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.240 align:middle line:84%
don't get to the harvest
lumber there anymore.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So they don't man
the fire towers.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So now, the fires can
get out of control

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:90%
before they get stomped out.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:27.640 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing that's changed.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It shouldn't be minor.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.062 align:middle line:84%
And then we've had the
strange weather and things

00:24:31.062 --> 00:24:33.742 align:middle line:90%
get really dry, bone dry.

00:24:33.742 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we've
always had that.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You know,
different seasons.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Then you start look at what else
has changed in our environment.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, we have cell phone towers.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.940 align:middle line:90%
We have Wi-Fi.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:90%
We have smart meters.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.500 align:middle line:84%
You can go down this
long list of things,

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:84%
all this electronic
pollution in our atmosphere.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it doesn't
take much to spark a fire--

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --during a

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Like the Midwest
normally has tornadoes.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And in the summer
of 2008, we start

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:90%
getting these mega tornadoes.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Humongous things that really
didn't exist much before it

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.800 align:middle line:90%
became common.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Like Joplin, Missouri
and things like that.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that coincidentally

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.600 align:middle line:84%
is February 2009
was the cutoff date

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.217 align:middle line:90%
to switch to digital television.

00:25:29.217 --> 00:25:30.050 align:middle line:90%

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.420 align:middle line:10%
at different times
throughout the year,

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:10%
not just in the winter months.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:90%
We've seen cases in September.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:90%
We've seen them in May.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet, even if the flu
season peaks in the spring,

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.100 align:middle line:84%
she still recommends people
get the vaccination once

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.040 align:middle line:84%
it's available because they
usually last a full year.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MAROUSHEK: If you're one
of the families of the people

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that sort of
vaccinate every year,

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.017 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
good protection.

00:29:09.017 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:84%
If you're somebody
that maybe has only

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.920 align:middle line:84%
had a first-time vaccine, then
it may not be as effective.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> But she says it's still
better than having no vaccine

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.657 align:middle line:84%
Katie Marsh isn't
taking any chances.

00:29:20.657 --> 00:29:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSH: If I can
give him a shot that

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.620 align:middle line:84%
even cuts down that
percentage a little bit

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.620 align:middle line:84%
that he could get sick,
I want to keep him safe.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.350 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
a parent should do, Judy?

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they want to
do the right thing.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to say, I
don't want to make a mistake

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:35.395 align:middle line:90%
and not give my kid--

00:29:35.395 --> 00:29:36.090 align:middle line:90%
what do they do?

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You ever heard
the term snot nosed kids?

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.120 align:middle line:90%
I never was one.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.402 align:middle line:84%
But in elementary
school, kids get sick,

00:29:43.402 --> 00:29:44.610 align:middle line:90%
and they get each other sick.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And they develop an
immunity for life--

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.578 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --of all the
stuff that's going around.

00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Why give them shots that
you don't know really

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.410 align:middle line:90%
what's in those shots?

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And they naturally develop
immunity with each other.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what was one
of the big red flags

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.650 align:middle line:90%
when we're told to stay home.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.620 align:middle line:90%
They sent college kids home.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And they sent elementary
school kids home.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.055 align:middle line:84%
Well, college kids, that's the
opposite of what you should do.

00:30:07.055 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Let them get sick,
get each other sick,

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.055 align:middle line:84%
and they all
develop an immunity.

00:30:10.055 --> 00:30:10.888 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:30:10.888 --> 00:30:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And they're
young and healthy.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.960 align:middle line:90%
And then let them go home.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they send them home
to infect their parents.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's something
that's come to my mind.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a baby that could
have been affected, but was

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:84%
not because my mom
had a good doctor.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:32.560 align:middle line:84%
From 1938 to 1972, a long
time, they gave women DES.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a synthetic estrogen
to help keep them

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.960 align:middle line:90%
from miscarrying the baby.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And unlike
thalidomide, which you

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:41.290 align:middle line:90%
saw an immediate effect of--

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the little
tiny flipper arms.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.510 align:middle line:90%
The baby looked fine.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.440 align:middle line:84%
The reason why it took 34 years
to realize there was a problem

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.650 align:middle line:84%
was when those children grew
up, especially the girls--

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.930 align:middle line:90%
you talk about DES daughters.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.672 align:middle line:84%
When they grew up
and reached maturity,

00:30:56.672 --> 00:30:59.130 align:middle line:84%
they suddenly started getting
all sorts of cervical cancer,

00:30:59.130 --> 00:30:59.690 align:middle line:90%
breast cancer.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: A huge amount that.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.820 align:middle line:90%
And infertility.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:09.630 align:middle line:84%
The boys were also affected with
underdeveloped sexual organs

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:10.788 align:middle line:90%
and infertility.

00:31:10.788 --> 00:31:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And so this is something that
was not seen until later.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And I now have gone
back and looked,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's the grandchildren
that are also affected.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.090 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
affected the DNA.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is anybody
doing anything

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.330 align:middle line:84%
for the good of the population,
or is it all sinister?

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Maybe it's
they get funding.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Was it Eisenhower in
his farewell address

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.443 align:middle line:90%
was talking about the--

00:31:34.443 --> 00:31:35.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Military
industrial complex.

00:31:35.985 --> 00:31:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: No, the academic
industrial complex,

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:84%
where he could foresee
a time in the future

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:45.060 align:middle line:84%
when government contracts
became a replacement

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.970 align:middle line:90%
for intellectual curiosity.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're at that
stage where you're

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.170 align:middle line:90%
paid to come up with an answer.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Not paid to find the truth.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're in a tense
time these days, Judy.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And part of me thinks it's a
wrestling of control of us.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That it might be a test
to see how far they can push

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.010 align:middle line:90%
before they do something else.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel that way too?

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, for sure.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.305 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think it's
so important for people

00:32:17.305 --> 00:32:19.640 align:middle line:90%
to look at what happened.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Before they go to who
did it or how they did it

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.740 align:middle line:84%
or what not, look at
the evidence yourself,

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.150 align:middle line:90%
and think of it yourself.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I call it knowledge
versus ideology.

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:32.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, just buying
into the group think.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is based on
your own information.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And as I often
like to say is know

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.180 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you know
that you know and know

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.800 align:middle line:84%
that everything
else you don't know.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.272 align:middle line:90%
Don't confuse the two.

00:32:44.272 --> 00:32:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, I
kind of believe this

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.272 align:middle line:90%
because that's what we're told.

00:32:47.272 --> 00:32:49.220 align:middle line:90%
No, that's ideology.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not knowledge.

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we didn't have 9/11,
would people question things

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:90%
as much as they are now?

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.855 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Not nearly as much.

00:32:56.855 --> 00:32:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Even you?

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Would you be questioning?

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: No, I
think 9/11 actually

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.938 align:middle line:84%
has helped this along because
remember right afterwards,

00:33:04.938 --> 00:33:06.980 align:middle line:84%
we're getting these frisking
lines at the airport

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.022 align:middle line:84%
and told what we can and
can't take on the plane.

00:33:09.022 --> 00:33:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Not even being
convinced that that anything

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.753 align:middle line:90%
to do with what happened.

00:33:14.753 --> 00:33:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's more and more
rights getting taken away,

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:90%
and people freely give it up.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.590 align:middle line:84%
There was an event
in Atlanta, Georgia

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
where a father put his kid
in the hot car in the summer

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.392 align:middle line:90%
to die.

00:33:26.392 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But there's cameras
that showed him going

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.080 align:middle line:90%
to Chick-Fil-A in the morning.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And he's with the kid and
missing the very first turn,

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.790 align:middle line:90%
which was take him to daycare.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Backing into
his parking space.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And exactly what he looked
up on the web all that day.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.110 align:middle line:90%
Watch him getting in his car.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Driving out of there
and driving to where--

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.150 align:middle line:84%
all these what he
did was horrible,

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.643 align:middle line:90%
but all these spy cameras.

00:33:48.643 --> 00:33:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
they're everywhere.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Why have
people agreed to that?

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Because of 9/11.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hate these red light
cameras at traffic signals.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hate that.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.225 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you're
sitting at night--

00:34:04.225 --> 00:34:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I get off the
air at "Coast to Coast",

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.929 align:middle line:84%
I'll sit at a light that
might be 10 minutes long.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You're not
hurting anybody.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's nobody there.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let me go.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, it's control.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And a new kind of income, I
guess, for establishments.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.489 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's worse in
China, though, the control.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:24.866 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, there's a
guy I know in China that I

00:34:24.866 --> 00:34:26.449 align:middle line:84%
had this conversation
with a few years

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:29.679 align:middle line:84%
ago that they're afraid
of the government.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:32.179 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I thought
what controlled people in the US

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:84%
was group think
or peer pressure.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I think we're
changing into the fear

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:38.150 align:middle line:90%
of the government.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is there
this herd mentality, Judy?

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.733 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: People feel
like they're safe.

00:34:42.733 --> 00:34:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in my
presentations I've

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.730 align:middle line:84%
started out with this
flock of birds taking off.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They all go together.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.429 align:middle line:84%
It says, which one knows
where they're going and why?

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:52.346 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:34:52.346 --> 00:34:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Who was the first one?

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.687 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Or deer getting spooked,
and they all run together

00:34:55.687 --> 00:34:56.813 align:middle line:90%
because safety in numbers.

00:34:56.813 --> 00:34:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some
of the questions, Judy,

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.040 align:middle line:84%
people should be
asking themselves

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.860 align:middle line:84%
when they watch
mainstream media,

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.420 align:middle line:90%
and they're looking at stories?

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: What happened?

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Where is the evidence?

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
evidence, you've got nothing.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a speculation.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And something I found in
common with 9/11, the weather

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:84%
change, whatever you want
to call it, climate change--

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Climate change.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --and the recent
events in the news where

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:28.910 align:middle line:84%
they required us to stay home,
they all have in common models.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Not investigation of real data.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:84%
9/11, when they
had NIST study it,

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:84%
they hired Applied
Research Associates

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.668 align:middle line:84%
to come up with the
model of a maybe possibly

00:35:39.668 --> 00:35:41.710 align:middle line:84%
hypothetical scenarios,
what could have happened.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, hypothetical.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, nothing to do
with what really happened.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:84%
They actually
responded to my request

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.550 align:middle line:84%
for a correction
saying that they didn't

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:51.823 align:middle line:90%
investigate the collapse.

00:35:51.823 --> 00:35:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The days of Walter
Cronkite, unfortunately,

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:90%
are gone.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But people
rely on the media

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.560 align:middle line:90%
as though they're still here.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:01.460 align:middle line:90%
And they trust it.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Actually, what to do?

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Throw your TV out the window.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keep the radio.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And then choose what you're
going to be watching through

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.780 align:middle line:84%
however, but the
network media, I

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.340 align:middle line:84%
haven't had a TV for
many, many years.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And just tune out
stuff that's going on.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So then you tend to
hear stuff as more

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.900 align:middle line:90%
abrupt to your consciousness.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Like these recent events, like
sending kids home from college.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.700 align:middle line:84%
When they're at school,
they can get each other sick

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.590 align:middle line:90%
and develop a natural immunity.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And then they can't be
carriers of anything.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem to be
very passionate about what

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:90%
you talk about.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.320 align:middle line:90%
I've known you for years.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And you are dedicated
to what you talk about.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.760 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.812 align:middle line:90%
What drives you?

00:36:51.812 --> 00:36:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I think it's
important for people

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.940 align:middle line:84%
to learn to look at
what's in front of them

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.710 align:middle line:90%
instead of assuming it.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of world
do you want to have?

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.490 align:middle line:90%
One where everyone's controlled?

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Or one where people
can think and choose

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.275 align:middle line:84%
what they want to do
with their life and time?

00:37:08.275 --> 00:37:11.803 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to outlaw
playing musical instruments?

00:37:11.803 --> 00:37:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you
don't play it well.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
whose definition

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:17.810 align:middle line:90%
is what playing well is?

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Or we're going
to have electronic music,

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
so you don't need to play
an instrument anymore.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much that gets
learned with that, with kids

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.170 align:middle line:90%
playing music in high school.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's also shown
that it is a way

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.920 align:middle line:84%
of helping against Alzheimer's
when people get older.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Because it develops
other pathways in the brain.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.645 align:middle line:90%
But to let people be free.

00:37:40.645 --> 00:37:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And to choose, don't
we want diversity?

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the 9/11
commission ever see your book,

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:47.170 align:middle line:90%
"Where Did the Towers Go"?

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.863 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Actually,
I believe they did.

00:37:48.863 --> 00:37:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Any reaction?

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, no, no.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.910 align:middle line:84%
They ordered several
copies of the book,

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:55.910 align:middle line:90%
but never hear about it.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Signed copies?

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.350 align:middle line:90%


00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm one person,
and because the truther all

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:07.787 align:middle line:84%
hated me, that that was keeping
under control pretty well.

00:38:07.787 --> 00:38:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, absolutely.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: So if it starts
getting larger and spreading,

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.340 align:middle line:90%
then do something.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But right now, they have so
many ways of controlling people.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know Richard
Gage, the architect, right?

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.107 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, I know of him.

00:38:18.107 --> 00:38:20.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they have
their own theory, which is--

00:38:20.655 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: They have a theory.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.817 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
not too far off,

00:38:23.817 --> 00:38:29.850 align:middle line:84%
other than the mechanism of how,
you two all agree that it did.

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:33.710 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't believe in
looking at the evidence.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And actually, lies
about what's in my book.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Because he can't refute it, so
he makes up some other story

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.000 align:middle line:90%
and tries to refute it.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And the
term space beams was

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.990 align:middle line:84%
brought about by Stephen
Jones to get people deterred

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.680 align:middle line:90%
from looking at my work.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Oh, she talks about laser beams
from outer space or something.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm just talking
about field effects.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, not specifying
exactly what it is.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But they keep everybody,
the thermite people

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.620 align:middle line:84%
keep everyone on the same
page and going around circles.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:07.245 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that they had to
hire this Professor Hulsey,

00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:08.870 align:middle line:84%
doesn't that imply
that they don't know

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:10.647 align:middle line:90%
how to investigate themselves?

00:39:10.647 --> 00:39:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Where are we going to
be headed as a society,

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.660 align:middle line:84%
as a people in
the next 10 years?

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Oh, I think it's going
to be decided in the next six

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.010 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: At least as
to how much control

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.460 align:middle line:90%
we want others to have of us.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we somehow squeak
by with this iteration,

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:90%
there'll be more.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And look at all of the
electronic monitoring we have.

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I was required to get a
new modem in my house.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I've always insisted on
having a non Wi-Fi one

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:90%
and just have a plug-in modem.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A plug-in type.

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They required
me to switch.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:52.990 align:middle line:84%
What kind of monitoring do
they want to do with that?

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pray for us, Judy.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Will that work?

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I do.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.502 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:39:56.502 --> 00:39:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you?

00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.680 align:middle line:10%
The website drjudywood.com?

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.060 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Doctor, D-R-?

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.200 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Drjudywood.com,
all one word.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And also, the book is
available on Amazon.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: "Where Did
the Towers Go?".

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And think about the
question that people

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.990 align:middle line:90%
should have been asking.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Look at that picture.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Is that a collapse?

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had half my
friends ask me for your book,

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.160 align:middle line:84%
the copy you sent me when
we did the radio show.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's
what I tell them.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Go to Amazon.

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Order it yourself.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.765 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Or the website
wheredidthetowersgo.com.

00:40:28.765 --> 00:40:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where do we go
in next 20 years as a society?

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:37.810 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: It's important that
we all think for ourselves

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:10%
and think your own thoughts.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.410 align:middle line:10%
And know the difference
between what you're thinking

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.150 align:middle line:10%
and what you're told
to think and what

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.960 align:middle line:10%
others are thinking around you.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's hope we
pull out of it, Judy.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
we're extinct.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I wanted to finish
that comment about the DES.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:57.385 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't known for--

00:40:57.385 --> 00:40:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody knew.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.085 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --one or
two generations.

00:40:59.085 --> 00:40:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody knew it.

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:00.780 align:middle line:90%
20 years went by.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.022 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Now, think of
what a vaccine might do.

00:41:04.022 --> 00:41:05.730 align:middle line:84%
What happens if
everybody become sterile?

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:07.105 align:middle line:84%
That's extinction
of the population.

00:41:07.105 --> 00:41:07.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:41:07.905 --> 00:41:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Instantly.

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Without an undo key.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.620 align:middle line:84%
You can't go back x number
of years by the time

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.922 align:middle line:90%
you discover the problem.

00:41:14.922 --> 00:41:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on the program.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:18.297 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Thank you so
much for having me.

00:41:18.297 --> 00:41:19.842 align:middle line:84%
I highly respect
you for that too.

00:41:19.842 --> 00:41:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Beyond
Belief", it's a program,

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:84%
of course, that delves into
the mysteries of the unknown.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Judy Wood has
dedicated her career

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:33.030 align:middle line:84%
to getting answers to things
that we think aren't probable.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.560 align:middle line:10%
You saw the videos.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.210 align:middle line:10%
You've seen the pictures.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.680 align:middle line:10%
What do you think?

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
