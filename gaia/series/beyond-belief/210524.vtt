00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] Now, when
we talk about sound healing,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.410 align:middle line:90%
how does it work?

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it depends
on the individual.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.420 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's all about
intention and awareness.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Sound is the nature--

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:84%
one of the principles of
consciousness and the cosmos.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Sound is one of the elemental
forces of creation as spoken

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:84%
through the mythos or
history of most wisdom

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:90%
cultures of the world.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
For me, mysticism is about
generating consciousness

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.300 align:middle line:84%
in the higher
states of our being.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.420 align:middle line:84%
It's about coming into
an interstate of clarity

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and purity in connection
with the whole

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:84%
or different greater
aspects of the whole.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the three inner
jewels and the three hearts?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Three inner jewels are
stillness, silence, and space.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.108 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.108 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
We've got a fascinating
program for you today.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.360 align:middle line:10%
Zacciah Blackburn is with
us, an international educator

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:10%
of sound healing, a
sacred sound channel,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.610 align:middle line:10%
and a shamanic practitioner.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:84%
He is the founder and
director of the Center

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:84%
of Light Institute of Sound
Healing and Shamanic Studies.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.372 align:middle line:90%
Zacciah, welcome to the program.

00:01:18.372 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ZACCIAH BLACKBURN:
Thank you so much, George.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm very grateful to be here.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a fascinating
first name you have,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:90%
too, by the way.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.207 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN: Yes, yes.

00:01:24.207 --> 00:01:25.707 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
have you had that?

00:01:25.707 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:10%
>>BLACKBURN: Well,
as a young man,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:10%
I had guides from the
inner worlds come in

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.630 align:middle line:10%
and start speaking to
me and directing me

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:10%
in a new direction in my life,
and that first guide that came

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:10%
was with me for
about four years.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And on his departure, in
a very critical moment

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.750 align:middle line:84%
of self-identity,
he gave me the name.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I was literally calling
to the universe, who am I?

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does it mean?

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.900 align:middle line:10%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, it
means the purity of God,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.480 align:middle line:10%
and Zacciah is one of the
protectors of the higher

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:10%
levels of the throne
of God, according

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:10%
to the Kabbalistic
teachings that I've studied.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in sound healing?

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:10%
>>BLACKBURN: As a young man,
I was given a bamboo flute,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:10%
and I became a flute
maker, making simple flutes

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:10%
like bansuri of India,
shakuhachi of Japan.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And I started studying with
master teachers and musicians

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
of those cultures, learning
their inherent ways of wisdom

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:84%
mixed with music,
contemplative, meditative,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:90%
and healing exercises.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And that, coupled with working
with contemporary teachers

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and elders of
other traditions, I

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
fused a practice that is
part of the sound healing

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:84%
culture, which has a wide array
of methodologies in the world

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Sound is the nature--

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:84%
one of the principles of
consciousness and the cosmos.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Most wisdom cultures
of the world

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
understand this and
utilize emerging

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.140 align:middle line:84%
of sound and consciousness
to bring forward intention.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
We have tremendous creative
potential within us.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Sound is one of the elemental
forces of creation as spoken

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:84%
through the mythos or
history of most wisdom

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:90%
cultures of the world.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when we
talk about sound healing,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:90%
how does it work?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, it
depends on the individual.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's all about
intention and awareness.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:84%
It's about coming into an inner
state of clarity and purity

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
in connection with the
whole or different, greater

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.270 align:middle line:84%
aspects of the whole and
bringing that forward

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:84%
with the voice while creating
an elemental field of sound

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.822 align:middle line:84%
with a simple tool, like a
crystal bowl or a native drum

00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going to get
into some of this later on, too.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN: Yes.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.552 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The principles
of sound healing are what?

00:03:30.552 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, it
depends on who's working.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Some people will just play
crystal bowls and say relax,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and they have beautiful
tones and harmonies

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.502 align:middle line:84%
that create neurological
pathways of relaxation.

00:03:41.502 --> 00:03:43.882 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so is it
like a tuning fork?

00:03:43.882 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Tuning
forks are part of it,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.298 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
studies about tuning

00:03:47.298 --> 00:03:50.720 align:middle line:84%
forks and their work
with mood disorders.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
MIT is doing studies on
particular binaural beat

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.490 align:middle line:84%
patterns and the potential for
healing Alzheimer's, and people

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.830 align:middle line:84%
who are working with
tuning forks for that.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But I don't go the
scientific route.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I studied with master elders
of different traditions,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:84%
and I use a more intuitive way
of connecting to inner guidance

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and bringing forward the sounds
that they help generate, mostly

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.590 align:middle line:90%
with my voice.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's coupled with intention.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:90%
What is it we want to do?

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:84%
What is healing in
the first place?

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: And if I'm with a
class of 20 students and I ask,

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
what is healing, I may have
20 different responses.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:84%
To me, healing, when you follow
it back to the root of origin,

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
it's about establishing a
connection with our wholeness,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and that follows back
further to establishing

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:90%
a connection with our holiness.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And that works with many
traditions from the East

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
that talk about our pure
states of consciousness,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
our pure nature, to the West,
and that's really the guiding

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.157 align:middle line:90%
principles for myself.

00:04:47.157 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Zacciah, how long
does it take to heal somebody

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.117 align:middle line:90%
with sound, generally?

00:04:51.117 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, we have
to start with what is healing

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and what the
intended outcome is.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself more a
facilitator in a practice,

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and I try to empower people to
discover their own innate self

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and bring that forward in
their lives in ways that

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:84%
help them integrate and
find meaning and fulfillment

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:90%
within their life.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is
the brain to all of this?

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: I think it's more
at a soul or spiritual level

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.695 align:middle line:84%
than the brain, but certainly,
the brain interacts.

00:05:16.695 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's been shown through
science that different sound

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:84%
practices calm the frontal lobes
and activate different aspects

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.790 align:middle line:84%
of other parts of the brain
that are more intuitive or more

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:84%
spacious oriented, the
occipital regions, for instance.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And you become more
receptive, and it's

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:84%
more easy to enter into a more
meditative or intuitive state

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
to work with the sound and
the intentions involved.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do sound
with your voice, too?

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: My voice is
a primary tool in my work.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I use tools like this to create
what I call a field of sound.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:84%
It creates an envelope in
which we can work with,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and then I call
upon my inner guides

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and ask for help and
guidance in the work

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.340 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing,
what the intention is.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And my voice is
hopefully connected

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
to those relationships that
I have in the inner world.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
mystical experience?

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, I think
that depends on who you ask,

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:84%
but for me, mysticism is
about generating consciousness

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:84%
in the higher
states of our being.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
In our daily lives, we tend to
overlook the greater aspects

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:84%
of self, whereas in mystical
or world spiritual traditions,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.470 align:middle line:84%
working with the nature of
the true aspects of the self

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:84%
in relationship to the
greater aspects of the cosmos

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.990 align:middle line:84%
is fundamental to
the work that we do.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting, and
sound and mystical experiences

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:90%
go hand in hand?

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, yes.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what culture
can you think of,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.740 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Tibetan Buddhism
or Native American shamanism

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:84%
or Christian
mysticism, that are not

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:84%
using sacred chant, sacred
instruments with their rituals

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and their ceremonies to heighten
the experience for the people

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:90%
working?

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, exactly
as you've said,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Gaia's program,
"Sound of Creation,"

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.130 align:middle line:84%
discusses how sound can
facilitate this kind of altered

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.130 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.420 align:middle line:84%

represents the great feminine.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the whole
of life, and this

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:90%
is the masculine principle.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you shake, you're
seeding the principles of life

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:90%
into creation.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So it requires the
practitioner who

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.990 align:middle line:84%
understands this to go into
a great quality of integrity

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:90%

good with the flute.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Flute is one
of my primary instruments.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.663 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:21:14.663 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we
perceive something

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:90%
that may be part of reality?

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well,
the three states

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:84%
of what's called the
inner jewels I just

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:84%
spoke of from Tibetan Buddhism
are amazing practices to do.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:10%
And all you do is go into
the heart or third eye,

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.660 align:middle line:10%
and you just go into a state
of feeling spaciousness,

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.940 align:middle line:10%
stillness, or silence.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:90%
And we all can do that.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:84%
If we have trouble
experiencing the felt sense,

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:84%
we can recall a time
in which we felt it.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself out in
one of the fields here

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:84%
on one of the mountains
during the daytime, certainly,

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:84%
but at night with the vast
field of stars around you,

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel
the beauty of that

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and imagine that
those are principles

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:90%
of light of the cosmos.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And you just expand
out into them.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So you go into a deep feeling
sense of vast spaciousness,

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:90%
and you just rest there.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:10%
The masters will
tell you that just

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.770 align:middle line:10%
by resting in one of these
three principles of stillness,

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:10%
silence, or space that it
creates a nest that you can

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.490 align:middle line:10%
rest in that is self-nourishing,
self-liberating,

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:10%
and self-luminous.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.720 align:middle line:84%
What we've discovered is
that it's far more than that.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%
First of all, if you're
in open spaciousness,

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:90%
you can't be in stress.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The two can't co-mingle,
so physiologically, it

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.550 align:middle line:90%
can help us with that.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But space-- science will tell
us it's the only thing that

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.965 align:middle line:84%
connects all things,
and the Tibetans

00:22:36.965 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
will tell us that it's
the fundamental nature

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:84%
of the great mother of all life
from which all life springs.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So just by being in space,
all of this is occurring.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.840 align:middle line:84%
What I found is that
mystically, shamanically,

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
that you're literally
connecting through the doorway

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:84%
to that great mother of
life, and so great potentials

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:90%
can come.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:84%
You literally can enter into
other dimensional states

00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:84%
just by resting in vast
space in the heart.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a
look at our friend Gregg

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Braden from Gaia's
"Missing Links"

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:90%
as he talks about a lot of this.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN: Beautiful.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.257 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: Fractal
patterns repeat again and again

00:23:10.257 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:90%
on different scales.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:90%
You and I already know that.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.050 align:middle line:84%
You know that when you have
a pattern in your life,

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:84%
when you have a pattern
in your relationships,

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:21.080 align:middle line:84%
and you are with one
person, in one job

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.830 align:middle line:84%
with one company in one city
and things aren't working well--

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:84%
how many times have
you seen people

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:90%
that say, OK, I need a change?

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:90%
So they go to another city.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.540 align:middle line:84%
They find another partner,
another job, another company,

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.330 align:middle line:84%
but they find that the same
patterns are showing up

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.250 align:middle line:84%
in their lives again
and again and again.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well,
I didn't choose well.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Let me make another change,
another city, another job,

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:84%
another company,
another partner.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.590 align:middle line:84%
How many times do we do
this before we realize

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that no matter where we
go, the same patterns are

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.290 align:middle line:84%
going to show up in our lives
again and again and again?

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Now you know the reason.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:84%
The reason is because we
are living fractal patterns

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:90%
in our biology.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:84%
We're living fractal
patterns in our emotions.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:08.600 align:middle line:84%
We're living fractal
patterns in our relationships

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:84%
because the energy of our
simulation, the information

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:84%
of our simulation is
governed by the fractal code,

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.910 align:middle line:90%
that fractal formula.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of
knowing this is,

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:84%
once we change that variable,
once we shift the way we think,

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:84%
the way we solve our
problems, the way

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:84%
we think of ourselves, once
we change our self-esteem,

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:84%
once we change the way we
value our lives or the way

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.170 align:middle line:84%
we value other people, that's
the equivalent of changing

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:90%
the variable in the code.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Now we're writing a new
code, and the new patterns

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.090 align:middle line:84%
are going to repeat again
and again and again.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.070 align:middle line:84%
If they're healthy patterns,
that's a really good thing.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm illustrating how
our experience is actually

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.540 align:middle line:84%
following the code that governs
the energy and the information

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.615 align:middle line:90%
of our entire simulation.

00:25:01.615 --> 00:25:02.990 align:middle line:84%
This is a very,
very powerful way

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.140 align:middle line:84%
to think about our
lives and our world

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and what we're experiencing
in our virtual reality.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Now that we understand
the simple mechanism that

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:84%
allows our simulation to sustain
itself, the fractal code,

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:84%
it makes perfect
sense that we would

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:84%
have the inner tools to
master our simulation in order

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:84%
to live the best lives and to
create the best world possible.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's right on.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Absolutely,
beautifully spoken.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's right on.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.668 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: And he's a master
teacher with great knowledge

00:25:31.668 --> 00:25:32.690 align:middle line:90%
about all of this.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
If I could speak a moment
on a practical application--

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Please.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: --about what I was
just saying, if we just go back

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%
to experiencing spaciousness
in the heart, what we are doing

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.070 align:middle line:84%
is creating the state of
what's known as clear view.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So we're dissolving
those patterns

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:90%
that he's talking about.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.660 align:middle line:84%
We're dissolving the entangled
emotions and belief systems

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:90%
that are not based in reality.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Just resting in space, we
develop a sense of clear view,

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and so we can see
everything more clearly,

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:90%
including our own lives.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And we can use that in
practical application.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Just by going into
clear view, it

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:84%
helps us to make clear choices
followed by clear actions.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.355 align:middle line:84%
But if we have a confusing
state of something going on

00:26:14.355 --> 00:26:15.980 align:middle line:84%
in our life-- should
I move to Chicago?

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:84%
What should I do
with my next job--

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.420 align:middle line:84%
we can go into clear view
through just entering

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:84%
spaciousness and draw that
life situation in and now

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:84%
see it clearly and ask
the question, what's

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:27.440 align:middle line:90%
my best choice here?

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:84%
How can I best be of service
to my own higher purpose?

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's stunning that part
of the wisdom of the teachings

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.820 align:middle line:84%
is that self-wisdom is
generated through this,

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and you see that you hold
much more wisdom than you

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:90%
might give yourself value for.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And this allows us to truly see
how to take steps in our lives

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.123 align:middle line:90%
that will better it.

00:26:50.123 --> 00:26:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN: Yes.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we realize
what's happening in our lives,

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.835 align:middle line:90%
does it make us better people?

00:26:56.835 --> 00:26:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, I think so
because that's our inherent

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:84%
nature, and we have
learned as a society--

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and that's worldwide--
to fix our attention

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.600 align:middle line:84%
on a very narrow
sense of values,

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:84%
a very narrow sense of purpose,
and a very narrow sense

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Reality functions at
multi levels of dimension

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and frequency, and if I were
thinking scientifically,

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.890 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at a very
small frequency of reality.

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:26.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not that what
we see isn't real,

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:84%
but there's such a vast
amount of reality around us

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
that we're not
paying attention to.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it's beyond our belief
because we haven't experienced

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
it, and we've grown up in this
very limited sense of belief

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.150 align:middle line:84%
and emotion, et cetera,
and life purpose

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.580 align:middle line:90%
and definition of who we are.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Most of us define ourselves
by, oh, I live here.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.730 align:middle line:90%
These are my children.

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.460 align:middle line:84%
This is what I do for work,
and this is my family.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But who we are goes far
beyond this time and space.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
It connects, actually, to a
much deeper dimensional state

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.700 align:middle line:90%
of all time and space.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.760 align:middle line:84%
We've been here
many lives before.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:84%
We bring much wisdom to
us from those other lives.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Many of us will meet a set
of teachings or a teacher,

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.918 align:middle line:90%
and a pattern will open in us.

00:28:13.918 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:90%
We're like, what is that?

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Freak us out.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.712 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Why am
I called to this?

00:28:16.712 --> 00:28:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it freaks us out.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.515 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: It
can freak us out,

00:28:19.515 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
but there are key codes
of patterning awaking us

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.035 align:middle line:84%
from the teachings of different
lineages and things like that.

00:28:27.035 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Hey, perhaps I was a master
teacher in Tibet or Greece

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.160 align:middle line:84%
or Egypt some time ago,
and I hear teachings

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.270 align:middle line:90%
from that lineage.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And it awakens something
in me that I'm carrying,

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:90%
and I don't realize it.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:90%
It's part of me.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And I don't value that
I've been here before,

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and I carry much
wisdom within me.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It appears to
me that the sound healing

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.970 align:middle line:84%
is a small facet
of what's going on.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:54.920 align:middle line:90%
The rest is up to us, isn't it?

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, what's
up to us is very important.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sound healing is a
small part of our culture,

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:90%
and it's not necessary.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I by no means promote
it as a necessity.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.260 align:middle line:84%
I have found great
value when we understand

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.390 align:middle line:84%
the principles of
sound in relation

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:84%
to the principles of creation
to generate greater states

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.850 align:middle line:90%
of fulfillment and well-being.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:20.510 align:middle line:84%
But really developing
a sense of who we are,

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:84%
whatever methodology we use,
whatever path we follow,

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.550 align:middle line:84%
is what's foremost, so we
need to really understand

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.160 align:middle line:84%
who we truly are as
a spiritual being

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and really have a
sense of our connection

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.890 align:middle line:84%
to the greater place than
just this local place

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.180 align:middle line:90%
that our small self lives in.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does reality
mean to you, Zacciah?

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, reality
is beyond our imagination.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.850 align:middle line:84%
I listen to the Tibetan
teachings of this,

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and they have a beautiful
way of expressing it.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about the
text and the teachings

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:57.410 align:middle line:84%
that they say are the
attempt to articulate

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:90%
that which is not articulable.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:84%
But true reality is that
which is not articulable.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.740 align:middle line:84%
It can only be
experienced directly.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And then they give you practices
like spaciousness in which you

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:84%
can go into deep,
direct experience,

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and then that brings
you an understanding

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of reality.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Bruce Lipton is a
genius when it comes to this,

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about how
your state of consciousness

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.530 align:middle line:84%
can affect your physical
health and life.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN: Yes.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.230 align:middle line:10%
>>BRUCE LIPTON: A
spontaneous remission

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.780 align:middle line:10%
is a change in the
belief system, a change

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:10%
in the consciousness, and
this is profoundly important,

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:40.680 align:middle line:10%
because this is where we have to
understand the control of life

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.490 align:middle line:10%
comes from.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:90%
What is your consciousness?

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Are you envisioning a
healthy, happy life,

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.490 align:middle line:84%
or are you concerned that
running in your family

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:54.510 align:middle line:84%
is cardiovascular
disease or diabetes?

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:57.040 align:middle line:90%
The point is very simple.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:84%
What image you hold
in your consciousness

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:84%
is translated into a
physical expression.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.930 align:middle line:84%
You can absolutely
change your life

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.720 align:middle line:84%
by changing your
consciousness because this

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation
behind epigenetics,

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and this is a story of
how vibration will also

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.080 align:middle line:84%
select our genes
and the character

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:90%
of that genetic expression.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:84%
The insights offered
by quantum physics

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:84%
really reveal the whole story
about how our consciousness is

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.900 align:middle line:90%
creating our life experiences.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.370 align:middle line:84%
If I go back to 1930 just
after quantum physics came

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.260 align:middle line:84%
into the world of
science, I wanted

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.200 align:middle line:84%
to leave you with a quote
from Sir James Jeans.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:10%
"The stream of
knowledge is heading

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.600 align:middle line:10%
towards a
non-mechanical reality.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.080 align:middle line:10%
The universe begins to look
more like a great thought

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.450 align:middle line:10%
than like a great machine.

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:55.650 align:middle line:10%
Mind no longer appears to
be an accidental intruder

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:10%
into the realm of matter.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:01.530 align:middle line:10%
We ought rather hail it as
the creator and the governor

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:03.900 align:middle line:10%
of the realm of matter."

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And to follow that
up, at the same time,

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Sir Arthur Eddington,
another physicist, wrote,

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.880 align:middle line:84%
"It is difficult for the
matter-of-fact physicists

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.620 align:middle line:84%
to accept the view that the
substratum of everything

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.330 align:middle line:90%
is a mental character."

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:23.120 align:middle line:84%
These two physicists
are actually

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.630 align:middle line:84%
giving us the most important
conclusions of quantum physics,

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:30.590 align:middle line:84%
that mind and consciousness
and energy fields

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.990 align:middle line:84%
are what shape our
life experiences.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And when we understand
that, then he says,

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:38.040 align:middle line:84%
well, if you want
to change your life,

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.190 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to do
anything physical,

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.590 align:middle line:84%
but you do have to do
something in regard

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:90%
to your consciousness.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So in conclusion, what
does this mean for you?

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.530 align:middle line:84%
The quality of
life is profoundly

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:53.750 align:middle line:90%
influenced by energy.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.430 align:middle line:84%
When energy waves
interfere with each other,

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:84%
they may express
constructive interference

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:03.260 align:middle line:84%
that enhances life energy or
destructive interference that

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.320 align:middle line:90%
actually cancels life energy.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.080 align:middle line:84%
To learn how we can
control our consciousness

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and manifest the
life we desire, it

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.270 align:middle line:84%
is first necessary
to understand how

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.390 align:middle line:84%
cells manage environmental
signals and controlling

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.985 align:middle line:90%
behavior and genetics.

00:33:19.985 --> 00:33:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
he's spot on, too.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: How
beautifully spoken.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.190 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By god.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.262 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Absolutely,
you've chosen some great spots

00:33:26.262 --> 00:33:28.523 align:middle line:90%
to put in there about it all.

00:33:28.523 --> 00:33:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
good people, too.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN: Yes.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So he was talking about
consciousness and energy,

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and in my own world
understanding,

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:42.390 align:middle line:84%
these are the two primary forces
of male and female reality

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:90%
that merge like the Sri Yantra.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.490 align:middle line:84%
The Shiva-Shakti union
from the Hindu culture

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.780 align:middle line:84%
shows this merging
of consciousness,

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:52.650 align:middle line:84%
which is exhibited through
the nature of Shiva,

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:56.050 align:middle line:84%
the male principle, and Shakti,
the female principle of life

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:56.850 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And when they merge,
all life is manifest,

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and of course, in
the Hindu tradition,

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.100 align:middle line:84%
it's manifest through
the sound of om,

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:11.520 align:middle line:84%
which represents that expression
of all creative manifestation.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.839 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the three
inner jewels the three hearts?

00:34:14.839 --> 00:34:17.909 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Three inner
jewels are stillness, silence,

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and space, and I've learned
practices that fundamentally

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.290 align:middle line:84%
put them usually
with either space

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:30.090 align:middle line:84%
or stillness in the heart,
silence in the throat center,

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and either stillness or
spaciousness in the third eye.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.940 align:middle line:84%
I've done practices going
both from the third eye down.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it supposed
to make you feel better?

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.982 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, it's
not about feeling better.

00:34:40.982 --> 00:34:42.929 align:middle line:84%
It's about getting
into states that

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:46.590 align:middle line:84%
bring about our inherent
nature that allow us to really

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:49.290 align:middle line:84%
experience our
connection to life

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.020 align:middle line:84%
and the inherent good
qualities of our self

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that arise when we still
the mind, when we let go

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.120 align:middle line:84%
of the abhorrent beliefs
that are not based

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.760 align:middle line:84%
in reality that we've been
taught about ourselves

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.640 align:middle line:84%
and the entangled emotions
that get in our way

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.410 align:middle line:84%
from all of our
life experiences,

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:10.530 align:middle line:84%
all of the wounding and
doubt and other things.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Buddha
said that doubt is

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.150 align:middle line:84%
one of the largest
forces that keeps us

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:84%
from self-realization and
feeling the connection to life.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.520 align:middle line:84%
There are so many confusing
emotions that we get into.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:84%
We look at the world today,
and it's especially confusing.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:32.280 align:middle line:84%
It's important to find ways to
establish a sense of stillness

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and stability within the
self, and these three jewels

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.320 align:middle line:90%
are part of that.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How have
you learned all this?

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Most of it
has come about from--

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.670 align:middle line:90%
I've been blessed in three ways.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.830 align:middle line:84%
I've had incredible
inner guides that

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:52.470 align:middle line:84%
first came to me at a very early
age and have evolved over time,

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and that brought me to
working with luminous teachers

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:84%
of different traditions from
Native elders of North, South,

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:03.265 align:middle line:84%
and Central America to Tibetan,
Hindu, and Christian mysticism.

00:36:03.265 --> 00:36:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they were all
willing to help, weren't they?

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well,
they're teachers

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.480 align:middle line:84%
that are there for anyone
who wants to come to them,

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.860 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, and I
graduated to each one of them

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and learn different
principles from each of them.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But I also bring a
great deal of this

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.860 align:middle line:84%
from who I am as
a spiritual being,

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and I find it important
to find value in all three

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:26.760 align:middle line:90%
of those aspects.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But I honor the many
teachers I've had.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I've been very blessed with
incredible wisdom brought

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:33.510 align:middle line:90%
through their blessings.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem
very enlightened.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, I
don't think of myself

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:40.310 align:middle line:84%
as any different than
anyone else on the planet.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I see us, really, as all
the same and yet unique.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, the word "individual"
means indivisible.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.090 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think of it as
something and somebody who

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.640 align:middle line:84%
is different when
they're an individual,

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.460 align:middle line:84%
but it actually is the
indivisible component

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.810 align:middle line:84%
of our self that is connecting
from and to all life.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And yet each of us
have a unique pattern

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:09.320 align:middle line:84%
or imprint and potential
that we bring into this life.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And that we work
on that potential

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.370 align:middle line:84%
to discover it if we have
not and find a path that

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.760 align:middle line:84%
will help us come into
realization of that potential

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.210 align:middle line:84%
is our ultimate goal and
purpose in being here.

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
blessed in that path,

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.525 align:middle line:84%
but I don't see it as any
different than any other,

00:37:27.525 --> 00:37:29.150 align:middle line:84%
at least not the
potential we all hold.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you
take this next, Zacciah?

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: I continue
as long as I can.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:38.750 align:middle line:84%
My intention is to be of service
to others to do the best I can.

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:40.970 align:middle line:84%
My primary intention
when I'm in practice

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:43.430 align:middle line:84%
is to be a vessel for
those who work with me.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.400 align:middle line:84%
If I can be an empty
channel, I'm doing great.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I remember very
early in my practice,

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I was doing one-on-one
healing with somebody

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:53.390 align:middle line:84%
on a massage table, doing
sound practices over them.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And my guides came in
and said, Zacciah, you

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.350 align:middle line:84%
do really good work, but
if you just open the door

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and get out of the way,
we'd really appreciate it.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Please.

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Yeah, and that's
pretty much been my practice

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.120 align:middle line:90%
ever since.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Just open the door and
get out of the way.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.735 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the power of nature,

00:38:07.735 --> 00:38:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and how does that
tie in to this?

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well, nature--
we are part of nature,

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of
our lost universe

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.060 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't realize that
we are birthed from nature

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and that nature is a direct
expression of creation.

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And by going into
nature-- nature

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.930 align:middle line:84%
is exuding all of these forces
and principles of creation

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:30.020 align:middle line:84%
all the time, so when
we go into nature--

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.120 align:middle line:84%
which you have a vast
resource here right

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.010 align:middle line:90%
outside the door in Boulder.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.830 align:middle line:84%
When you go into nature,
you feel the resonance,

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and you entrain
to that resonance.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to go into
altered states, which

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:44.630 align:middle line:84%
are really our true
state of pure resonance

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.420 align:middle line:84%
that nature is always
exuding, at least where

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.640 align:middle line:84%
it's been left alone
to do its own thing.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Nature just exudes
its beauty and joy.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And we go there,
and we feel that.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And if we'll just
kind of surrender

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:58.820 align:middle line:84%
to the quality of
resonance we feel there,

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:02.300 align:middle line:84%
it will help us come into our
own unique resonance, which

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.450 align:middle line:84%
is part of nature and should
be connected to nature.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
right relationship

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.330 align:middle line:90%
have to do with this?

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.705 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Right relationship
is a principle understood

00:39:10.705 --> 00:39:14.240 align:middle line:84%
by most cultures, whether it's
the Tibetan Buddhists, who

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.840 align:middle line:84%
might define Dharma as
the nature of the greater

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.890 align:middle line:84%
self in relationship to the
principles of the cosmos,

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:26.270 align:middle line:84%
or the Peruvian mystics, who
would say that we will all

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.860 align:middle line:84%
awaken when enough of us
come into right relationship

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.040 align:middle line:84%
the living energies
of earth and sky,

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.380 align:middle line:84%
or my Cherokee
elders, who would say

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.770 align:middle line:84%
that by entering into right
relationship with the giving

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and taking of all
life, we will enter

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:40.340 align:middle line:90%
into harmony with all life.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.860 align:middle line:84%
This is culture upon
culture really speaking

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.810 align:middle line:90%
about right relationship.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And I could say that it's
an intuitive understanding,

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and yet there are principles
that abide within the cosmos

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:56.720 align:middle line:84%
that it is our purpose to
come into alignment with.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we come in
to right alignment

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.650 align:middle line:84%
with the principles of
creation, then we're

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.570 align:middle line:90%
in right relationship.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you deal with
sacred sites at all, Zacciah?

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN: Oh, absolutely.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
makes them so sacred?

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Well,
"sacred" is a word

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that actually means that which
we make as holy, but to me,

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:17.300 align:middle line:90%
everything is sacred.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking of one of my
Tibetan teachers who would say,

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.630 align:middle line:84%
once you honor
everything as sacred,

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.100 align:middle line:84%
you will be in that
right relationship.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.460 align:middle line:84%
But sacred sites,
to me, are sites

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:32.750 align:middle line:84%
that are either natural
Earth sites that

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:36.380 align:middle line:84%
hold profound power and
potential for transformation

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.050 align:middle line:84%
or are sites built by
different cultures,

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:41.510 align:middle line:84%
mostly ancient cultures
but modern cultures

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.570 align:middle line:84%
as well, that are
regarded as sacred or holy

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:47.150 align:middle line:84%
by those cultures and
have very special energy.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:51.080 align:middle line:84%
The ancient peoples, as
Gregg very well knows,

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:84%
understood this and
had a felt sense

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:57.920 align:middle line:84%
of how to find and
locate natural Earth

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.620 align:middle line:84%
sites of tremendous
power for transformation

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and build their temple
complexes there.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And then they added to it
with their own consciousness.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, and
their own creativity.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: Absolutely,
and their wisdom.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And many of those cultures
understood the technology

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:17.390 align:middle line:84%
of fusing their wisdom and
knowledge into the stones.

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Stones hold memory.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:22.490 align:middle line:84%
They receive,
store, and transmit

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:23.600 align:middle line:90%
energy and information.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.250 align:middle line:84%
That's almost a
direct quote from

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.410 align:middle line:90%
my Peruvian mystical teachers.

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Stones receive,
store, and transmit

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.570 align:middle line:84%
energy and
information, and that's

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.400 align:middle line:84%
exactly how our
modern culture works

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.690 align:middle line:84%
with those little stones
in our phones and computers

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:37.490 align:middle line:90%

>>MICHAEL TELLINGER:
Adam's calendar--

00:41:46.273 --> 00:41:50.540 align:middle line:10%
it is just another example of
ancient advanced technology

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.750 align:middle line:10%
and knowledge of the
ancient civilizations

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.390 align:middle line:10%
that we know very little
about and the capacity

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.460 align:middle line:10%
to create machines.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is what people
need to comprehend.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.380 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about
these ancient sites, all

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:06.410 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient sites--
literally, without exception,

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.770 align:middle line:84%
all of them were originally
constructed as machines.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:15.020 align:middle line:84%
They are not dwellings for
people or animals or cows.

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.630 align:middle line:10%
All these ancient sites,
when you look at them

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.760 align:middle line:10%
and you understand sound,
resonance, and frequency--

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.420 align:middle line:10%
you understand cymatics--
it is very, very

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.660 align:middle line:10%
obvious that all these ancient
sites have one thing in common.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.650 align:middle line:84%
The original purpose
was to generate energy.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And so there's not
really a difference.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different
way or a different means

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.920 align:middle line:84%
of construction, having the
knowledge of sound resonance

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and frequency, how to use
the natural frequencies

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.570 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, the
vibration of the Earth,

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.640 align:middle line:84%
and turning it into
a very powerful

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.610 align:middle line:90%
energy-generating device.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: If the
knowledge of sound

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:54.290 align:middle line:84%
had the power to transform

within these circles,
how did it work?

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Gregg Braden explains
an important finding

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.560 align:middle line:90%
at most of these sites.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.140 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: When we look
at the materials that

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.260 align:middle line:10%
are used to build some of the
most sacred sites in the world,

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.960 align:middle line:10%
there's a common thread that
weaves all of these sites

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.920 align:middle line:10%
together, and that is that
the stones that are used often

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.930 align:middle line:10%
hold properties that influence
the human body in the presence

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.280 align:middle line:10%
of those properties.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:28.040 align:middle line:10%
One of the most prolific is
quartz and the use of quartz

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.100 align:middle line:10%
either in sandstone
or in granite.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.830 align:middle line:84%
What we see is a
kind of quartz that

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:37.700 align:middle line:84%
is called piezo quartz
or piezoelectric quartz,

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and this quartz has
the property that when

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.820 align:middle line:84%
it is stressed, when it
is put under pressure,

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.310 align:middle line:90%
it emits an electrical charge.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:48.740 align:middle line:10%
This is the kind of
quartz that is often

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.050 align:middle line:10%
used in what's called
a quartz watch.

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:55.760 align:middle line:10%
So when the spring
in the quartz watch

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.220 align:middle line:10%
presses against that
little quartz crystal,

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.890 align:middle line:10%
it emits enough of
electrical charge

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:10%
that it powers the watch.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.840 align:middle line:84%
This is what's used
in these sacred sites

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:10.100 align:middle line:84%
because there is an energy
in the pressure of the Earth

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:84%
pushing against
the quartz grains,

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.040 align:middle line:84%
releasing that electrical charge
in a way that can be felt when

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.980 align:middle line:90%
a human walks into the site.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's truly
remarkable, isn't it?

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN: It really is,
and what Gregg says, also,

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.535 align:middle line:90%
in the science of it--

00:44:25.535 --> 00:44:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and some parts of it is
beyond my experience,

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:32.660 align:middle line:84%
but my experience is directly
with the sites that here,

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.940 align:middle line:84%
again, if we come into
right relationship,

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.700 align:middle line:84%
if we come into resonance,
into a reverential

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.010 align:middle line:84%
state in resonance
with the site,

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:42.050 align:middle line:84%
we can actually
come into communion

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:84%
with the wisdom keepers of
the site, the unseen beings

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:48.590 align:middle line:84%
still there, holding the wisdom
of these ancient cultures.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And they will
collaborate with you

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:54.200 align:middle line:84%
if you understand how to
enter in right relationship.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And those stones hold the memory
and wisdom of the teachers.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:00.210 align:middle line:84%

taught me how to do--

ancient temple complexes.

the best way is

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.300 align:middle line:10%
