00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.038 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:19.849 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:20.515 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.580 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:90%

00:00:41.868 --> 00:00:44.550 align:middle line:90%
And welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:10%
You know, we have all prayed
at one time in our life.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.510 align:middle line:10%
We have all used intention
to try to get something done.

Our special guest
on "Beyond Belief"

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:84%
tonight is the founder of
the White Light Express.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Please welcome Sarah Nash.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.757 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.757 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hi, Sarah.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>> SARAH NASH: Hi, how are you?

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good to see you.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Good to see you.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You too.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would see you
coming in a beam of light.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, we worked on
that back there, but, you know,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:90%
not enough time.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What is the
White Light Express?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:10%
>> NASH: The White Light Express
is a healing endeavor that

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.670 align:middle line:10%
my very best friend Avis
Latone and I came up with years

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:10%
and years ago, when we were
going through a very difficult

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.510 align:middle line:10%
time in our lives.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And we would say
to each other, I'll

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.110 align:middle line:90%
pray for you if you pray for me.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And we had friends
that would hear that.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So they began asking us,
can pray for us, too?

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: So what happened
was, this tipping point

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness in our
community of friends.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to bring
it out to the internet.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:90%
This was back in 2001.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:90%
So we formed a little group.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And in the group,
we had a box car.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And was a box, it was
like a literal box.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And everybody would put
their hopes, dreams,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.680 align:middle line:90%
and desires in that box.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And we had one person a
week that we would focus on.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And things began happening
in people's lives,

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:90%
healings started happening.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
People who couldn't
find work were working.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:90%
People who were becoming--

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And somebody might
have put in, I need a new

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.840 align:middle line:90%
career.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Or I need a-- so they would
drop it in there, right?

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, essentially,
I would design a box car.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And being called the
White Light Express it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.279 align:middle line:84%
was like a literal train of
energy that started happening.

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you know
what was in the box?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Initially.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Now when we have the
prayer requests line,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.910 align:middle line:90%
there's hundreds.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So we don't put them out
there, because a lot of them

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:90%
are confidential.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's only two people
who actually read those prayer

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:90%
requests.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things that I wanted to say,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
is that we never reveal
anything, any information.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:90%
I am an ordained minister.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:90%
And my sister is, too.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important for
us that if people-- and lately,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
we've been getting some really
amazing requests, as far

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:90%
as power and energy.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And some of these people
are getting really, really

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.960 align:middle line:90%
desperate out there.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed there
seems to be an increase.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's growing.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: It is growing.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But I bet the
results are also astounding,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: They are.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I have a funny one that I
wanted to share with people.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.828 align:middle line:84%
And then I have a very
serious one, as well.

00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:34.953 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're not going
to make us cry, are you?

00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.915 align:middle line:90%
I might, though.

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.338 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: OK, what's
the funny one?

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: The funny one is, I
have this gentleman who he has

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
been sending us this
same prayer request.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:90%
He's a salesman.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: And he's been
sending us the same request.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
He needs to sell
a certain amount.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.057 align:middle line:90%
And it has to happen--

00:03:56.057 --> 00:03:57.181 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: His quota, right?

00:03:57.181 --> 00:03:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes, his quota.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And it must be working,
because he asks us

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:90%
every month for the same thing.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Every month.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
a little more,

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:90%
sometimes it's a little less.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, can you be too
greedy when you do something

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I don't think
you can be greedy enough.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.014 align:middle line:90%
I think you need to ask.

00:04:13.014 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Ask, ask, ask, ask.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Ask and it
shall be given, right?

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.695 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: And I got to tell you,
what happened, though, is that,

00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:84%
evidently his work environment
was-- it wasn't very healthy.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And he started,
at the beginning,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.872 align:middle line:84%
he would say can so
and so please leave.

00:04:28.872 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Please get rid of this person
in my work environment.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, he was praying
for people to get fired?

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Exactly.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.723 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just,
we were like, well, no.

00:04:35.723 --> 00:04:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Because the goal of
the White Light Express

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.049 align:middle line:84%
Is to translate everything to
its highest possible power.

00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's positive, right?

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.881 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes.

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:90%
This is what happened though.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:84%
In this very last
healing request

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that he sent us, he
said, and if possible,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:84%
can everybody in the
office get along?

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, that's not bad.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No, it was amazing.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely amazing.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:84%
From, I need this person
to be out of the office,

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and I need this
person to go away,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and I need for my boss to
quit harassing me, and yada.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:84%
It was can everybody
drop into their hearts?

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Can everybody-- and so
it was amazing to watch

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.430 align:middle line:84%
the exponential
growth of this man's

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.259 align:middle line:90%
own personal consciousness.

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I thought for a moment
you were going to say he got

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.030 align:middle line:90%
fired.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.531 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No.

00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:21.905 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because is does
backfire sometimes, doesn't it?

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Well, I hope not.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.849 align:middle line:90%
I hope not.

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There was
a "Twilight Zone"

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
episode of a guy
who wanted wishes.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:10%
And the genie came and said, but
every which has a consequence.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.220 align:middle line:10%
And so he wished for power.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And the genie turned
him into Hitler.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, it
ruined him, there.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:90%
He wished for money.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
The genie turned him into a bank
robber, and he got arrested.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So do you find with prayer that
everything has a consequence?

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Is there, OK, you're
going to get this,

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:90%
but this could happen to you.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Absolutely,
yes, it does.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I tell people
to be incredibly specific.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:84%
If you're asking for patience,
sometimes what happens

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
is you get involved
in a situation where

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
you have no choice
but to learn patience.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can find
yourself in a situation

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:84%
with your child or
a loved one, where

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.580 align:middle line:84%
you're sitting there going
a rising of irritation

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:90%
with so and so.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you're kind of putting
yourself into a situation

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
where, if you don't
exude patience,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
or if you don't
exhibit patience,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.000 align:middle line:84%
or if you don't have patience,
it will be thrust upon you.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So when we ask for
healing requests,

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:84%
when we ask for-- if
you need a new job,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:90%
be specific about your job.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.121 align:middle line:84%
Be specific about what it
is that you're asking for.

00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Don't just ask for a
job, because somebody

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.600 align:middle line:84%
will offer your job
as a dishwasher.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.457 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: And I mean, some people
enjoy becoming a dishwasher,

00:06:59.457 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:90%
and that's OK.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: But if you
have specific skills,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and if you know what it is
that you need, ask for that.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I have a very good friend who
needed a new refrigerator.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So she prayed for
a new refrigerator.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And by God, she got the
most amazing refrigerator.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.037 align:middle line:84%
And gosh darn it, that thing
would not fit in her house.

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: See.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.226 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah.

00:07:18.226 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:84%
She's like, why do you have
this great refrigerator

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.180 align:middle line:90%
on your porch?

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, well, I
prayed for a refrigerator.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.007 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: She should
have measured.

00:07:24.007 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Simple things.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.006 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, and
that's extreme.

00:07:26.006 --> 00:07:28.492 align:middle line:84%
Please, God, give
me a refrigerator.

00:07:28.492 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But prayer
and intention works.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I know on Fridays, on "Coast
to Coast" on the radio show,

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:90%
we have a prayers list.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And people write in for
afflictions or things.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And I put them on a list
that is non-published,

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
just like you,
it's very private.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And then people on Fridays will
pray, generally, just pray.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And I get astounding
results from that.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.325 align:middle line:90%
It's weird.

00:07:53.325 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, somebody
said, my cat is

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:90%
going to be put down next week.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Can we please pray?

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And the next week
the cat's alive

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:90%
and lived another five years.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.649 align:middle line:84%
It's unbelievable
how this works.

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I'm a little
jealous of you.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why?

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Because you get
a lot more responses back.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I would very much like
people to respond.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I know it's working, because
a lot of the same people

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.970 align:middle line:84%
will ask for healing
and manifestation.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.241 align:middle line:90%
And I have a little mantra.

00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I tell people, when you're
focusing on the White Light

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Express to focus on
first your health,

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and then love, and then
abundance, prosperity, and then

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:90%
joy.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little five word
mantra that everybody can say.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what religion you are.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.289 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very important
for people to not become

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:84%
too wrapped up in
religious dogma

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
with regard, especially,
to the White Light Express.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.270 align:middle line:90%
We open it to everybody.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:84%
If you can focus,
just for a moment,

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit of
white light on, just

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:90%
towards the healing grid.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk a
little bit more about the grid,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
because I'm excited
to tell you about it.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.922 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I love
the healing grid.

00:09:03.922 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say,
well, how does it work?

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I'm just putting
out white light there, I mean,

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it just go everywhere?

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there a
white light lasso?

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Just this energy here is just
for the White Light Express.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.530 align:middle line:84%
That's very interesting,
when people ask me

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:84%
about the laser-like
precision of sending out

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:84%
white light to a specific
purpose, like world peace,

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
or ending hunger, or
health, or healing.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And how do we know
that it's working?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What are we
tapping into, though, Sarah?

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
What is out there that
makes this happen?

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to say, it's God.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's even
something more involved here.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.190 align:middle line:90%
What is it, in your opinion?

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I think, OK, and I
have my woo-woo explanation,

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and then I have my
scientific explanation.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I know you're familiar with
the work of Ingo Swann.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Ingo Swann.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: The late,
we just lost him.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.161 align:middle line:10%
>> NASH: Yes.

00:10:06.161 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:10%
And he was phenomenal.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.335 align:middle line:10%
And I believe he ended
up working for the CIA.

00:10:12.335 --> 00:10:13.790 align:middle line:10%
I only have a little bit of--

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: He worked for the
government in a remote viewing

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:10%
project.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:16.946 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Exactly

00:10:16.946 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And brought some very
good remote viewers along with

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.200 align:middle line:90%
him.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I think the White Light
Express is a little bit like

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:90%
remote viewing.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.070 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that if
you focus your intention

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:34.030 align:middle line:84%
on a specific subject,
or a specific item,

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:84%
that that-- we know that
molecules will react

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:84%
differently if they
are being watched.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is the one just
as strong as the many,

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:90%
with intention or prayer?

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I'm going to say, no.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say no.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Because where two or
more are gathered,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:90%
there is extra energy.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're
just one person alone

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.265 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the desert,
and that's all you've got.

00:10:59.265 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Then that's all you've got.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
pray, I need water.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you can gather a group
of like-minded individuals,

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't have to
be a religious endeavor,

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.807 align:middle line:84%
and you can focus on something
really positive happening,

00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:84%
then something really
positive is going to happen.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:90%
It's going to affect a change.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: And I also believe
that that happens with negative

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.720 align:middle line:90%
energy, as well.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.280 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say,
well, if I come together

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
with a group of
people and they're

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:84%
thinking really negative
thoughts, you know.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like going to
a football game,

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.182 align:middle line:84%
you know, which side
does God believe in?

00:11:37.182 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Hopefully,
the good side.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Well, there you go.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little
bit like the Force.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But you think
10 people acting together,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.079 align:middle line:84%
generally, will be able to
pull something off than one--

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --in prayer.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I truly do.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.856 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If they're all
praying for the same thing?

00:11:56.856 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I truly do.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there have
been studies out there

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
about people who know that
they're being prayed for,

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:84%
versus people who don't know
they're being prayed for.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.820 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
people ask us, if I've

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
got somebody who doesn't
really believe in this,

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.172 align:middle line:84%
can I put them on
the healing grid?

00:12:15.172 --> 00:12:16.505 align:middle line:90%
And will they still be effected?

00:12:16.505 --> 00:12:17.713 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, will it work?

00:12:17.713 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes. it will work.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:84%
However, I have
had better results

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:90%
with people who were aware.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think this has to
do with consciousness.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
I think this has
to do with, when

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.330 align:middle line:84%
I know somebody
is focusing on me,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:84%
when I know that I'm
getting help and healing,

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:84%
my experience is
going to be better

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.466 align:middle line:84%
because I feel better
and more cared for.

00:12:41.466 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they seem to help
it along, if they're believers,

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, and I think,
as human beings, too-- I mean,

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:84%
again, this goes into a
little bit more of the woo-woo

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.460 align:middle line:90%
explanation.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But if the universe
is just holographic,

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and we are just bits and
pieces of energy arranged

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.820 align:middle line:84%
in a certain pattern,
light will affect us.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why it's
White Light, not Words of Joy,

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.890 align:middle line:90%
or Words of Love.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
It's White Light
because white light

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.057 align:middle line:84%
is good across-- it's
good across the spectrum.

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can focus white light.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.223 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's interesting,
when people die,

00:13:15.223 --> 00:13:17.356 align:middle line:84%
they say they see
this white light.

00:13:17.356 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I did.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So you never know.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into that in a second.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions
on intention and prayer

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:90%
for Sarah Nash.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes, way in the back.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I'm just curious,
the people that actually

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:84%
contribute or pray, that
are intention, you know,

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:84%
throwing intention out
there, is it anybody?

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Like if I want to be one of
the people focusing energy.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just a certain group
within your organization

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:90%
that does the intention?

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: We actually open
it up to for anybody.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:14:00.510 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go online, and
we have a Facebook page, where--

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of
people focus and pray,

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.790 align:middle line:84%
but they don't want their
name associated with it.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to know
who the other people are

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.120 align:middle line:84%
who are focusing on
that month's grid,

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.240 align:middle line:84%
then you can join up
with our Facebook page.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:90%
We have an event.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're listed throughout
the rest of the year.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can just say that
you're attending each one.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And did that answer
your question?

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, I didn't
know if everybody could also be,

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.070 align:middle line:84%
not just putting
in the requests,

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:84%
but also being the people
helping with the intention,

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.260 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.635 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: That's
a great question.

00:14:32.635 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, so much.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a group called
the Guardians of the Grid.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's on our Community, the
White Light Express Community.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're an interesting
group of people,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:84%
because the discussion
forums there, they actually

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
do a lot of prayer,
24/7, all the time.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Not just the seven days
that the grid is active.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So the Guardians
of the Grid, if you

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:84%
want to become a Guardian
of the grid, absolutely.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Sign up, do it.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:58.864 align:middle line:90%
Love you.

00:14:58.864 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Great.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.029 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:02.033 align:middle line:84%
Who's got another
question for Sarah, here?

00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:02.533 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:02.533 --> 00:15:05.722 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.722 --> 00:15:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: This is
a two-part question.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
You indicated that you're
a minister of some sort.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.352 align:middle line:84%
Are you with any
particular denomination?

00:15:15.352 --> 00:15:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And the second part
of the question

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:84%
is, how do you determine
what is white light,

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and what is off gray
light, or green light?

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words, something that
may, I may think is white,

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.210 align:middle line:90%
may not be so white.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:90%
So how do you work with that?

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.307 align:middle line:84%
What's you're defining
way of doing it?

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: That's an
excellent question.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:84%
First, I was, when I
was 18, I answered an ad

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
in the back of "Rolling
Stone Magazine"

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and I became a
Universal Life minister.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.111 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: "Rolling
Stone Magazine?"

00:15:47.111 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I actually have
somebody in the audience here

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:90%
who can corroborate that.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.293 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:15:51.293 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: But, yeah.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I decided to leave
the Mormon Church.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I was raised as a
Latter Day Saint,

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and I left the
Mormon Church, which

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:84%
gave me an excellent
foundation, by the way.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:84%
But I left, because I believed
that the Holy Spirit belonged

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.929 align:middle line:90%
to everybody.

00:16:07.929 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I believed that
everybody should have

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.261 align:middle line:84%
the Spirit of Light
with them all the time,

00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:84%
24/7, and that you didn't need
to be a part of a religion

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:84%
to have the gift
of God's spirit.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And whether you
believe in God or not,

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
there's an energy involved with
the power of positive thinking.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:90%
So I left.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I became an ordained minister
in the Universal Life Church.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And then, four
years ago, I became

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
ordained as a Melchizedek
Priest in the Sanctuary

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Beloved, which
is out of New York.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And Dan Chesbro is
the-- and all of this

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:90%
is available for research, too.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.930 align:middle line:84%
But my goal was to become
a Melchizedek Priest.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And to have that
type of authority.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And this goes into a little
bit more of an esoteric--

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: But those who are
familiar with Melchizedek

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, and
what he brought,

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
the power and the authority
of the priesthood.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:10%
And meaning that he could
ask for the authority

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.800 align:middle line:10%
of white light to happen.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.633 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: And his other
question, of course,

00:17:10.633 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:10%
is what's the difference
between white light,

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.854 align:middle line:10%
or light of a different
shade or color?

00:17:14.854 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Excellent question.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And that also goes
into a little bit more

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
of the esoteric
research out there.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:84%
Leah Rose activates the third
ray of rose quartz light,

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:84%
or rose light,
which then activates

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:90%
the fourth ray of miracles.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Now white light is an
encompassing of all the colors.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, that's pretty
much just scientific fact.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But when you blend all the full
spectrum of light together,

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
you're asking for all of the
light to be concentrated.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:90%
And it is pure.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, if you
have off-gray light,

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:84%
then there's a purpose
for off-gray light.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
green light, there's

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:84%
a pur-- I mean, that's why we
have red lights, green lights.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.615 align:middle line:90%
You know, they mean stop.

00:17:57.615 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:90%
They mean go.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:84%
There's all different
practices associated

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:84%
with the violet flame,
the emerald flame.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
specific healing purposes.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But white light
encompasses it all.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you want
manifestation of a miracle,

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:84%
healing for your body,
healing for the heart,

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.512 align:middle line:90%
healing for the soul, it--

00:18:21.512 --> 00:18:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's the
purest form of energy.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:23.844 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: It is.

00:18:23.844 --> 00:18:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of like throwing
it all into one pot and saying,

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:90%
I want it all.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:90%
I want it all to happen.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.135 align:middle line:84%
So I know that there are of
like Wiccans, for example,

00:18:33.135 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:84%
will light certain
candles green--

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And different
colors, that's right,

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:36.770 align:middle line:90%
for different things.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Because certain
colors represent certain types

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:90%
of manifestation needs.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But white light just
encompasses it all.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was ultimately the
goal of the White Light Express,

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:84%
to bring it together and not
just focus on any one thing.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take
another question for Sarah.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes, way in the back.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.775 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: OK, can you
tell me something specific?

00:19:01.775 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Like maybe an event or something
that happened in your life

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.860 align:middle line:84%
that like validated
that this was

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:90%
worth putting your energy into?

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.720 align:middle line:84%
Or that this was actually
something that you believed in?

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.090 align:middle line:84%
What was something that
stood out in your life?

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Something
happened to you.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:90%
So what was it?

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: When I
was 12 years old,

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.980 align:middle line:84%
I had an operation on
my middle right ear.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And this ear is actually
just decoration.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But I was clinically dead
on the operating table.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe that, to the
best of my knowledge

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and from the paperwork, they
gave me too much anesthesia.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That happens.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I had to have--
here's the interesting thing.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I was laying on the
operating table,

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.580 align:middle line:84%
and I was nude
from the waist up.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, I didn't know
that, because I lifted out

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:84%
of my body, and I was
looking at my body.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking to
myself, why am I naked?

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And I had this red solution
on the front of my body.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And I now know that it
was Betadine solution,

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.100 align:middle line:84%
that they use that
to cleanse you.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:90%
And to--

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Disinfect you.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:09.469 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes, thank you.

00:20:09.469 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And the side of my
face was peeled over.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.330 align:middle line:90%
It was horrific.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.159 align:middle line:90%
They had to--

00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They slit
you and pulled it over?

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:17.533 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah.

00:20:17.533 --> 00:20:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have this really
lovely scar here, behind me

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:90%
ear.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But I was looking at my
body, and then I saw my face.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like, all
right, that ain't right.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:90%
I was a little panicked.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:90%
And then, there is a tunnel.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.350 align:middle line:90%
There truly is a tunnel.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was this massive vortex
of cobalt blue and black.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And it was spinning.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:90%
And I went directly into it.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was blasted out into
the middle of the universe.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.521 align:middle line:90%
And this amazing light--

00:20:52.521 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A white light.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: A white light.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Brighter than any of the
lights in the studio,

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and anything that I've ever
seen since, beckoned to me.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:90%
And it just exuded love.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And that
was 12 years old?

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.036 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I was 12 years old.

00:21:06.036 --> 00:21:07.620 align:middle line:90%
I had no preconceived notions.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
anything about any type

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experiences
or out of body experiences.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't-- now
I know so much about it,

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:90%
because it happened to me.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And I, of course, studied it
for years and years and years.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And talk to other people who
have had identical experiences.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But I sincerely wanted
to go to that light.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:84%
It was the most incredible
healing, beautiful sense

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:42.270 align:middle line:84%
of love and safety
and warmth and caring

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever experienced.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.399 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you
want to come back?

00:21:46.399 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I did not
want to come back.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Most don't want to.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:84%
They feel so much
bliss that they just

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:90%
don't want to come back.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:84%
But when you did come back,
and you're 12 years old,

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.230 align:middle line:90%
how did that change you?

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:84%
How did that affect you
through your adult life?

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I lost a lot of fear.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I indeed, I just--
I wasn't afraid

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:90%
anymore of so many things.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And I had had such an
eclectic childhood.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:18.800 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't afraid anymore.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:84%
There was this element of fear
that was gone from my reality.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to share
that with other people,

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.520 align:middle line:84%
so I began telling
as many people.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.001 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I started telling
the nurses and everybody.

00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know,
they begin drilling me.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, how did you know this
and how did you know that?

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And so there was proof there,
that at the very least,

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I had had an out
of body experience.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to
share that there was

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:49.800 align:middle line:84%
something more and something
brilliant and something perfect

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:84%
that we all had to
look forward to.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you get
involved in meditation,

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
in order to get
into this state now?

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:58.680 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:90%
I meditate every single day.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's for a half an
hour, an hour, or five minutes,

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
or a minute, there
isn't a day that

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:84%
goes by that I'm not focused
in some sort of meditation,

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.090 align:middle line:84%
where I just-- all I do, and
all you really have to do,

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.107 align:middle line:84%
is just sit in gratitude
for just a moment.

00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's it?

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: That's
it, in my opinion.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.922 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
it works for you.

00:23:24.922 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I think so.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.838 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You told us about
the story of the individual who

00:23:27.838 --> 00:23:29.810 align:middle line:84%
kind of wished some
things at his office,

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:31.080 align:middle line:90%
then he kind of changed.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Yeah, he's
my favorite guy.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But you also mentioned
that there was a story that

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.910 align:middle line:84%
probably didn't work
out right for somebody?

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.432 align:middle line:90%
Or a little more tragic?

00:23:39.432 --> 00:23:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: We have those.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.348 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What happens?

00:23:41.348 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: We do have those.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, I really try to focus
on a lot of the successes.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.860 align:middle line:84%
But a really good question
is, well, you know,

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Sarah, we focused white light.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.372 align:middle line:84%
We focused, and we
focused for weeks.

00:23:53.372 --> 00:23:54.663 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And nothing happened?

00:23:54.663 --> 00:23:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: And nothing happened.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.282 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why?

00:23:58.282 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Here's
what I want to say.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to say
something did happen.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:84%
The tipping point of
consciousness in your life,

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:84%
you focused on healing,
and you believed

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:84%
in something
outside of yourself.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So that, in and of
itself, is worthwhile.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:84%
That's very difficult
to say to somebody

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
who is in the process
of losing a loved one.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Or who has lost a loved one.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.942 align:middle line:84%
Or even just a
beloved pet which are

00:24:23.942 --> 00:24:25.150 align:middle line:90%
like children to some people.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.233 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, how many
times do we hear stories,

00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:90%
how could God do this to me?

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't happen.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not God's fault, is it?

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Not in my opinion.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely not God's fault.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:43.280 align:middle line:84%
The ball was put into action,
and choices have consequences.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's a phenomenal
movie out called

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:84%
"Ink" that has a scene
about the synchronicity.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen
anything like it out there.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if we can
talk about movies or whatever?

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You can talk
about anything you want.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.400 align:middle line:90%
This is "Beyond Belief."

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.066 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I know.

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:84%
This movie is
beyond belief, too.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a scene
in this movie that

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.490 align:middle line:84%
is just phenomenal about
the cause and effect.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
everything that

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:90%
leads up to a car accident.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's wild.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
It's from the guy who drops
the flower on the corner,

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.605 align:middle line:84%
to the woman who turns
around with her--

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: To look at it.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.015 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: It's just this--

00:25:26.015 --> 00:25:27.467 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In slow motion, right?

00:25:27.467 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Oh, it's amazing.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So we set these
things into action.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:84%
But here's what I
want to tell people.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.497 align:middle line:90%
Surround yourself with angels.

00:25:37.497 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I know this gets a
little bit woo-woo.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
believe in angels, fine.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Surround yourself
with positive energy.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:84%
We know that if we burn a
piece of sage, which we're

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:84%
going to do here
in a little bit,

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that it puts negative
ions in the air.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason why
shamans of old would sit

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and they would some
of the peace pipe,

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.740 align:middle line:84%
or surround
themselves with smoke.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or drink
out of my Gaiam cup.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: There you go.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: With
whatever is in here.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Cheers, I
can do that, too.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Now I know what Dean
Martin used to do.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: But surrounding
yourself with positive energy

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:84%
is, to me, the most important
thing that you can do.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Or you can ask your
angels to be with you.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And that involves believing in
something outside of yourself.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
cater to everybody.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:84%
I am one of those
weird people who

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.245 align:middle line:84%
wants to please all of the
people all of the time.

00:26:30.245 --> 00:26:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:35.551 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you get upset if
it doesn't work all the time.

00:26:35.551 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But it can't
work all the time.

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:38.948 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I don't
I don't get upset.

00:26:38.948 --> 00:26:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There are factors
out there that stop it.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, what
if somebody who

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:50.920 align:middle line:84%
is asking for help and prayer
really is an evil person.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.249 align:middle line:90%
And they just haven't changed.

00:26:52.249 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:90%
They haven't come around.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to work for them?

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Define evil.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Non-good.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Not good.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have an evil person
who is saying, help me.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.850 align:middle line:90%
We don't judge.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not for us to judge.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the light's going to go
where the light's going to go.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And if this evil person
needs help, and, you know,

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.122 align:middle line:84%
I can't sit here and
make an assessment

00:27:16.122 --> 00:27:18.163 align:middle line:84%
when I'm reading off the
prayer requests in front

00:27:18.163 --> 00:27:18.800 align:middle line:90%
of the healing grid.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Would you
pray for an evil person?

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Absolutely, I would

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.773 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You would?

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:22.774 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: In fact, extra.

00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:24.231 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They need
a little boost?

00:27:24.231 --> 00:27:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe their little sponges need
to be opened up a little bit

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:84%
more and allow a little bit
more of the healing energy in.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not for us to decide who
is evil and who is not evil.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I have my personal feelings
about certain things,

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.090 align:middle line:90%
as we all do.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
good, or that's bad.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:48.854 align:middle line:84%
And so we-- I try to
stay away from labels.

00:27:48.854 --> 00:27:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Aren't there, though,
some evil people you would

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:90%
prefer to stay away from?

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Oh, yeah.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I think everybody
has had that experience.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:57.523 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah.

00:27:57.523 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I call them
psychic vampires.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Ooh, energy
vampires, psychic vampires.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And you know, here's
the interesting thing.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.320 align:middle line:84%
In a group like the
White Light Express,

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:84%
especially in our
activities online,

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:84%
we have these people who come in
and they're attention grabbers.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, oh, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm always, I need
energy, I need energy.

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:24.040 align:middle line:90%
And I try not to feed into that.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I really, I just find
that that's draining.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's the
healing grid, Sarah?

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.516 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:28:31.516 --> 00:28:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Thanks for asking.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.140 align:middle line:90%
I love our grid.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:84%
This is where it gets
a little bit odd.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But because we don't
have box cars anymore,

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and I suppose we
could have a box car,

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:84%
but I have a spot in my
home where I set up a little

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.930 align:middle line:90%
alter space.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Now my sister and I,
my very good friend,

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I call her my
sister, Avis and I,

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.180 align:middle line:84%
we set up our healing
grid once a month.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:90%
And it actually has-- Leah Rose.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:90%
We call her Leah Rose.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:84%
She is a magnificent
rose quartz crystal skull

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And she came to us by way
of a very phenomenal gift

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:90%
from a friend in Port Townsend.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.830 align:middle line:90%
It was just, it's a long story.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But I decided, after my studies
with regard to the healing

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.840 align:middle line:84%
rays, we know the
rose quartz, if you

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:84%
want to get into metaphysics
and to that kind of thing,

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.260 align:middle line:84%
we know that rose
quartz crystal activates

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:84%
the third ray of
love, which activates

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:90%
the fourth ray of miracles.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In a form of energy?

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: In a form
of energy, yes.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:90%
And it transmutes energy.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Now I can say that your
computer has crystals in it.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.480 align:middle line:90%
And it helps with energy.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So this pretty much
works in the same way.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:54.421 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of an energy activator
for the White Light Express

00:29:54.421 --> 00:29:54.920 align:middle line:90%
grid.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Now people get a little weirded
out because it's a skull.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:90%
She's awesome.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:01.907 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: She's very cold.

00:30:01.907 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah, right now she is.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes she gets
really warm, too.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:11.890 align:middle line:84%
But she's sort of
our little battery.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:13.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's a focal point.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:84%
If nothing else,
it's a focal point.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So I was trained in Wicca, my
sister was trained in Wicca.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:23.950 align:middle line:84%
But this is, it's we're
all about the ritual.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.210 align:middle line:84%
When we do this, it's
about actually putting

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.680 align:middle line:90%
maybe sacred alchemy, who knows?

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But on each grid, we have
a little bit of fire.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.910 align:middle line:90%
We light a candle.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.125 align:middle line:90%
We have water and--

00:30:38.125 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That sounds
like witchcraft, Sarah.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I know.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is it?

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:41.515 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No.

00:30:41.515 --> 00:30:42.348 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:30:42.348 --> 00:30:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:47.660 align:middle line:84%
What it is, it's we really
want to focus on Gaia's energy,

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.180 align:middle line:90%
on earth energy.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So for us, and we
don't ask everybody

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.250 align:middle line:84%
to do this, this
just what we do.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:84%
We have earth, air,
fire, and water.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And that helps us
focus on the earth.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
different items that we

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.600 align:middle line:84%
use that we've collected
over the years.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.670 align:middle line:90%
But we always have a candle.

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And we always did that
from the very beginning.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:15.760 align:middle line:84%
We lit a white candle, because
I would go to this Catholic

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Church, nearby my home,
and I would light a candle,

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.830 align:middle line:90%
and I would ask for healing.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And I like the idea of a candle,
and a seven day burning candle,

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:84%
because it gives you
something to focus on.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
do any of this.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I recommend it because
I like the ritual,

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I like actually putting
to action your thoughts.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.610 align:middle line:90%
I like following through.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But that's part of from
right brain to left brain.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.660 align:middle line:84%
If you want to remember
something, you write it down.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So when you have the candle
burning in your home,

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.820 align:middle line:84%
then you remember to take a
time out in that day and pray.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Now if you can't have a candle,
because sometimes it's just not

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.710 align:middle line:84%
safe to do that, I tell people
to get little incense sticks.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And don't go to sleep with
a candle puffing away.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, when I
was a kid in Catholic school

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.279 align:middle line:84%
and church, they would
have candles at the altar.

00:32:12.279 --> 00:32:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And people would come in
and light them, and then

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.200 align:middle line:90%
pray for people.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But as a young boy, I
just never understood

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.105 align:middle line:90%
why are they doing this?

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Here's a church full of candles.

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.410 align:middle line:90%
They're all lit.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And all these people
are there praying to it.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.592 align:middle line:84%
So it's got to have some
kind of meaning to them.

00:32:29.592 --> 00:32:30.425 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: It's light.

00:32:30.425 --> 00:32:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:37.778 align:middle line:84%
Gratefulness.org has a
wonderful healing grotto online

00:32:37.778 --> 00:32:39.903 align:middle line:84%
that we link to with the
White Light Express, where

00:32:39.903 --> 00:32:42.550 align:middle line:84%
you can go light a virtual
candle for someone.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:43.910 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a focal point.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.010 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:49.112 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps there is some sort
of sacred alchemy about it.

00:32:49.112 --> 00:32:50.237 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Can I light this?

00:32:50.237 --> 00:32:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A focal point.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.054 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah.

00:32:54.054 --> 00:32:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.261 align:middle line:90%
So you have this little candle.

00:32:56.261 --> 00:33:01.740 align:middle line:90%


00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.960 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: You can
drop that in there.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:07.900 align:middle line:90%
There.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So what's it do?

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Well, it's flame.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.910 align:middle line:90%
And it is light.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:15.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's alive.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.501 align:middle line:90%
And it feels good.

00:33:17.501 --> 00:33:18.500 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.416 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's pretty.

00:33:19.416 --> 00:33:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Yeah, and
it's very pretty.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.521 align:middle line:84%
Last night at dinner,
we were talking

00:33:22.521 --> 00:33:25.030 align:middle line:84%
about surrounding ourselves
with beautiful things.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:30.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems that I think
we face as humanity and society

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
today is that we
don't surround ourself

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:90%
enough with beautiful things.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.130 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of war.

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:38.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
violence in video games.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we
really need to do

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.330 align:middle line:84%
is start focusing on
the next generation.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.790 align:middle line:84%
The ones that they
call the Millennials.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And the Crystal kids
that are coming through,

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.080 align:middle line:84%
because they're
really, really lost.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.710 align:middle line:90%
And they need direction.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And if they surrounded
themselves with beauty,

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and if they had better music,
instead of-- and Dr. Emoto's

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:04.680 align:middle line:84%
work is another classic example
of energy, of energy waves.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you
blast hard rock music

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.889 align:middle line:84%
with explicit and
terrible lyrics at water,

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:14.234 align:middle line:90%
then the crystals in the water--

00:34:14.234 --> 00:34:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It looks that way.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: It looks
chaotic and not healthy.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yet if you
play beautiful music,

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and look at it,
it looks gorgeous.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Exactly.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What a
great experiment.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: And that's the
White Light Express.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.909 align:middle line:90%
Focus that positive intention.

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Focus it.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And let's bring these
kids into it, too.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.139 align:middle line:90%
Now kids like ritual.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've got three adult
children of my own.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
beginning and a middle

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and an end, which is
another reason why

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:45.090 align:middle line:84%
we have the grid,
what we call the grid,

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.340 align:middle line:84%
it gives people
something to focus on.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And why seven days,
why not all the time?

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.159 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll tell you a secret,
it is all the time for me.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I have my White Light
Express grid constantly.

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you pray,
who do you pray to?

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I don't pray
to anyone specific.

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.830 align:middle line:90%
I have my Heavenly Father.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.950 align:middle line:84%
I say a prayer to my Heavenly
Father and my Heavenly Mother,

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and to the elementals
and the spirits.

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And divinity and the
energy all around us.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Some people might
pray to Krishna.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Some people might
pray, I mean, you know,

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:22.550 align:middle line:84%
in Alcoholics Anonymous
they have your higher power

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.800 align:middle line:90%
could be a doorknob.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.075 align:middle line:90%
But just have a higher power.

00:35:25.075 --> 00:35:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line is, try
to have a higher power.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:32.390 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Here's the big
question, through prayer,

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.740 align:middle line:10%
through intent, is it the
individual who is changing

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.600 align:middle line:10%
the action, or is there
something out there

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.830 align:middle line:10%
in the cosmos that is doing it?

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Both.

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I believe both.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.626 align:middle line:84%
I believe strongly
that it's both.

00:35:45.626 --> 00:35:47.250 align:middle line:10%
But it's very difficult
to explain that

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:51.830 align:middle line:10%
to somebody who is an atheist.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.540 align:middle line:10%
It's very difficult
to explain that

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:56.740 align:middle line:10%
to somebody who's had an
incredibly difficult life.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.435 align:middle line:84%
And they feel as though
they're beaten down constantly.

00:35:59.435 --> 00:36:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.470 align:middle line:84%
The odds are against
them, constantly.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: They've lived the
constant life of Sisyphus.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Forever pushing that
ball up the hill.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the life
Job, who knows?

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's very difficult to step
into somebody's life and say,

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:16.440 align:middle line:90%
you've got to keep going.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.420 align:middle line:90%
You've got to keep going.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe,
in my experience,

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.610 align:middle line:84%
that if somebody is
out there caring enough

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:28.950 align:middle line:84%
to say that to this person, then
this person has two choices.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:32.320 align:middle line:84%
They can be accepting
of that energy coming

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.680 align:middle line:84%
at them, that love,
that positivity.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Or they can push it
away and maintain

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:41.600 align:middle line:90%
an attitude of despair.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And for people like myself,
who counsel people constantly,

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I have some people who
really just are not happy

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.181 align:middle line:90%
unless they're unhappy.

00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I know a
person like that,

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:84%
who has the darkest cloud
over his head, constantly.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he'll walk into a room
and say something negative

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.750 align:middle line:90%
about himself or something.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:84%
If he goes to a party, he'll
say no one's going to like me.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:13.640 align:middle line:84%
If he's applying for a job,
the first thing he says

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:90%
is, I'm not going to get it.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anybody so negative

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and have this black
cloud over their head.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
he doesn't get the job.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.320 align:middle line:90%
Nobody likes him at the party.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I think he brings
this on himself.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I believe he does.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.140 align:middle line:90%
I truely do.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that,
if we get-- again,

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.950 align:middle line:84%
there's that tipping
point in consciousness.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:43.530 align:middle line:84%
If we get enough people
who are out there

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and who are promoting
this white light,

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and who are promoting positive
energy, and it's visible

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and people can see exponential
growth and this thing.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's happening,
because it does work.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And more and more people
are getting involved.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's going to
be difficult for other people

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:07.630 align:middle line:84%
to say, this isn't real,
because it is real.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not there's
divine angels working for us,

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:17.070 align:middle line:84%
whether the energy is, in and
of itself, just part of a...

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:19.984 align:middle line:84%
interstellar ESP matrix
that we can all tap into.

00:38:19.984 --> 00:38:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Maybe it's got
its own intelligence.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.685 align:middle line:84%
You know, and it
hears your request

00:38:23.685 --> 00:38:26.590 align:middle line:90%
and just goes off and does it.

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Little tiny
genies in the ethers.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: As long as it works.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Exactly, and it does
work over and over and over

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.520 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Again, when we think back to
those people who say, Sarah,

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I prayed and prayed and
prayed and nothing happened.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell them,
something did happen.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.310 align:middle line:90%
You prayed.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:46.070 align:middle line:90%
You prayed.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:48.210 align:middle line:84%
You believed in something
bigger than yourself

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.567 align:middle line:90%
and that energy went out there.

00:38:50.567 --> 00:38:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course you can't say that
to somebody who is suffering.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.065 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Sarah, first of all, if people
want to get a hold of you,

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.940 align:middle line:84%
or if they want to see more
of what you do with the White

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Light Express, where do
they find you on Facebook?

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:02.860 align:middle line:90%
How do they do this?

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.860 align:middle line:10%
>> NASH: Oh, it's
whitelightexpress.com and .org

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.990 align:middle line:10%
and .net.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.990 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Simple enough.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.060 align:middle line:10%
>> NASH: We grabbed it all.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you're in the
new social media, I love it.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Oh, yeah.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:12.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:13.810 align:middle line:90%
And we're on Twitter.

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And we have a Ning
community online.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And we also have a
conference that we present

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.840 align:middle line:84%
each year, the
White Light Express

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Conference and Gathering.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is in August,
in Fort Worden.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm going
to be at that for you.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes, you are.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:29.855 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait.

00:39:29.855 --> 00:39:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: White Light
Express is now twitting, huh?

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.605 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: It is.

00:39:32.605 --> 00:39:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.854 align:middle line:84%
Just sending out laser like
beams of love and light.

00:39:36.854 --> 00:39:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Super.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some
questions for Sarah,

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.790 align:middle line:84%
as we talk about the
prayer and intent.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And have you ever
used it in your life,

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.900 align:middle line:84%
to get something done, or
to accomplish something?

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't be shy.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: When I was younger,
I used shamanic techniques

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:58.770 align:middle line:84%
to try to gather power
in my life, like that.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was always
kind of hazardous,

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.350 align:middle line:84%
because I was coming
from a point of view

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.300 align:middle line:90%
where I wanted the power.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And I could act in the
world, once I had that.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And what I kind of
found happening was,

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:84%
when you start to focus
on like the greater good,

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.770 align:middle line:84%
or the best for
yourself, is also

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:22.120 align:middle line:90%
what's best for other people.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And the universe can kind
of fill in a lot of the gaps

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.010 align:middle line:84%
when you're not
sure what happiness

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:31.490 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to look
like, or fulfillment.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:35.700 align:middle line:84%
If you could maybe expound
on that a little bit?

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And don't
you find that,

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:42.280 align:middle line:84%
when you don't push something,
things tend to happen a little

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.310 align:middle line:90%
quicker?

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.474 align:middle line:90%
Or a little more in your behalf?

00:40:46.474 --> 00:40:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I think it
depends on the situation.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.570 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:56.360 align:middle line:84%
It would be interesting to
have a conversation with people

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.110 align:middle line:84%
who have used
Shamanic techniques.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.374 align:middle line:84%
And of course, like I
said, I studied witchcraft

00:41:01.374 --> 00:41:03.290 align:middle line:84%
for years and years, and
moved away from that.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:05.480 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself
a light worker now.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
these labels that we

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.470 align:middle line:90%
like to put on each other.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I don't see
witches as bad people.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: No, neither do I. Some
of my very best friends are

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.420 align:middle line:90%
witches.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a religion.

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:17.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful religion.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But again, the
White Light Express

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.040 align:middle line:84%
is not about any
particular religion.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.970 align:middle line:84%
It is strictly about
sending positive intention

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.193 align:middle line:84%
for the tipping point
of human consciousness.

00:41:29.193 --> 00:41:29.943 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ongoing.

00:41:29.943 --> 00:41:30.782 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Ongoing.

00:41:30.782 --> 00:41:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's nice to know we
have a group out there doing

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.026 align:middle line:90%
this, on our behalf.

00:41:35.026 --> 00:41:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, I'll
tell you something.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I get really
disgusted with a lot

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:43.470 align:middle line:84%
of the religious
organizations out there

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:47.730 align:middle line:84%
who use prayer as a
way to rope people in.

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.380 align:middle line:90%
They have prayer request lines.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And I, of course, look at them,
because I'm interested in them.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.520 align:middle line:90%
This is my life.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.400 align:middle line:90%
This is what I do.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm very passionate about it.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.600 align:middle line:90%
So I will connect with them.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.420 align:middle line:90%
I'll call them up.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll, you know-- because, I want
to feel that spirit that I know

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.670 align:middle line:84%
exists within me, that is,
I believe, the Holy Spirit.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
say, yes, absolutely.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's pray for you.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And oh, by the way, let's
have your email address

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:19.210 align:middle line:84%
so that we can send you
4,000 requests for money.

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm not
trying to be a martyr.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.420 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I truly believe
in what I'm doing.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.910 align:middle line:90%
And this is part of my work.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.300 align:middle line:84%
But I don't ask
people for money.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.786 align:middle line:84%
I don't ask-- we don't
ask people for money.

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:37.160 align:middle line:84%
If they want to
send in donations

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.570 align:middle line:84%
to help with the web
site, that's fine.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:42.100 align:middle line:90%
But this is not about money.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.300 align:middle line:84%
This is not about a
money making endeavor.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.660 align:middle line:84%
This is not about-- this
isn't even my platform.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have my own separate
thing that I do on the side.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:53.540 align:middle line:90%
But this isn't about me.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.060 align:middle line:90%
This isn't about you.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.370 align:middle line:84%
This isn't about any
one particular person.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:59.740 align:middle line:90%
It isn't about one God.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:04.110 align:middle line:84%
It is about raising the
consciousness of humanity

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:07.480 align:middle line:84%
to promote healing,
and manifestation,

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:11.220 align:middle line:90%
and conscious growth.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And the greed thing
behind-- I don't

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.220 align:middle line:84%
think money is the
root of all evil.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:18.720 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's
pretty darn close.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I think the love of
money is at the root of all

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:25.830 align:middle line:90%
evil-- greed, essentially.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And that isn't to say that
people who ask for-- you know,

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.260 align:middle line:90%
fundraisers are fabulous.

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Donations are fabulous.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But I am just so tired of, and
I haven't found-- I mean please,

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.730 align:middle line:84%
somebody, if you have a group
that doesn't ask for money

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.545 align:middle line:84%
or isn't part of a
religious platform

00:43:44.545 --> 00:43:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and you want to join up with us,
or you want us to join up you,

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:48.410 align:middle line:90%
bring it on.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:49.779 align:middle line:90%
But I haven't found one yet.

00:43:49.779 --> 00:43:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's difficult.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, don't forget
to drop $10 down on the table

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:55.750 align:middle line:90%
before you leave.

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.140 align:middle line:84%
With technology, Sarah,
let's flip the switch.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:59.990 align:middle line:84%
We'll go to our
"Beyond Belief" cam

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and let's see what
the question is.

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi, Sarah,
I'm Miranda from Oklahoma.

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering if the
concept of love, light,

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:11.602 align:middle line:84%
and good intentions could
improve people's daily lives?

00:44:11.602 --> 00:44:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, that's
an interesting question.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Can the power of love,
light improve things?

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.450 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Oh, absolutely.

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:21.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at plants.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.640 align:middle line:84%
If you just take a
plant and, you know,

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.210 align:middle line:84%
you've got a couple
of plants here,

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and kids do it all the time
for science experiments.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to plant
this bean here.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
to it every day.

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.495 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to plant this
other bean here and not

00:44:32.495 --> 00:44:33.230 align:middle line:90%
talk to it.

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.730 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:35.813 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, it's the
guy who's in the hospital.

00:44:35.813 --> 00:44:37.560 align:middle line:84%
If he knows that he's
being prayed for,

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.660 align:middle line:90%
he's going to feel better.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Of course.

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: As opposed to the guy
who wishes that somebody was

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.630 align:middle line:90%
thinking about him.

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
studies have shown

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:52.060 align:middle line:84%
that sending out that
energy, just even

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:54.970 align:middle line:84%
if you're standing in
the-- at the checkout

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:56.740 align:middle line:90%
counter at the grocery store.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And you ask somebody,
and you genuinely say,

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:00.330 align:middle line:90%
"Hi, how are you?"

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And you really mean it, it
can change somebody's day.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Or freak them out.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.434 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Not in Colorado.

00:45:07.434 --> 00:45:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Hey, let me tell
you an interesting thing.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Back in Los Angeles,
I'm at the post office.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And they've got this line, where
they kind of herd us through

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.730 align:middle line:90%
to get to the front.

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And then one of three or
four open spots will call

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and the first person goes
to the next postal person

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:27.070 align:middle line:90%
until the next one opens up.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:28.390 align:middle line:90%
So people are waiting in line.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm walking to get into
this area to get in line,

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, I'm reading
this little letter I've got,

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:37.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to mail.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And some lady cuts in
front of me, walking.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.440 align:middle line:84%
If she were driving,
I would have hit her.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.410 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So she walks in front of me
and I hit the back of her shoe

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.270 align:middle line:90%
with my shoe.

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:52.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's how close
she cut in front of me.

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.270 align:middle line:90%
No big deal on my part.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But she turns around and
goes, you stepped on me.

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.620 align:middle line:90%
And I went, excuse me.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And so she walks in,
and she's waiting

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.910 align:middle line:84%
to get called up
to the line there.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm behind her, and
then she turns around goes,

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.720 align:middle line:90%
you're too close.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.290 align:middle line:90%
I must have been two feet away.

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:15.480 align:middle line:90%
There's somebody behind me.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.520 align:middle line:90%
There's not much room to go.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, ma'am, are
we having a bad day?

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And then she looked at me, and
she stopped for a few seconds

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.710 align:middle line:90%
and then said, I'm OK, now.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And then she tried
to laugh about it.

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But I have never been, in my
life, in a situation like that.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Where somebody was so
uptight about everything

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:40.350 align:middle line:90%
that was happening.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.820 align:middle line:90%
What was wrong with this person?

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.030 align:middle line:84%
They need white
light, lots of it.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Lots and
lots of white light.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose
somewhere in the South,

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:52.700 align:middle line:90%
maybe some white lightning, too.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:53.970 align:middle line:90%
If they go that route.

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just amazing.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: But no.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I think the key was that
you were in the post office.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:00.440 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.639 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There's a lot
of strange energy there.

00:47:02.639 --> 00:47:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: There really is.

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: From the get go.

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I know.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Is that, one of the
things that I would really

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.926 align:middle line:84%
like to change about the
world is even just driving.

00:47:13.926 --> 00:47:15.550 align:middle line:84%
We've got these
rage-aholics out there,

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:16.960 align:middle line:90%
that are driving on the road.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And God only knows
what their day is like.

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:21.260 align:middle line:84%
But instead of
flipping somebody off.

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying, you know, oh,
what a-- that guy was an idiot.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:25.535 align:middle line:90%
Did you see what that guy did?

00:47:25.535 --> 00:47:26.326 align:middle line:90%
I can't stand that!

00:47:26.326 --> 00:47:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: See, the
road rage begins--

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.816 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: We need
more white light.

00:47:29.816 --> 00:47:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --from the bad driver
who may be a very unwitting

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.840 align:middle line:84%
person, going on
their merry way.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.270 align:middle line:90%
But they may cut somebody off.

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Or not signal.

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Or I hate it when--
no I'm kidding.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.610 align:middle line:90%
But that's what happens.

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:48.470 align:middle line:84%
The person who road rages
can't control their temper.

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:53.202 align:middle line:84%
But it's the bad driver that
sets them off, all the time.

00:47:53.202 --> 00:47:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, who's
to say, there again,

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.760 align:middle line:84%
there we go with it the,
that was a good person.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.710 align:middle line:90%
That was a bad person.

00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this person was just,
you know, forgot at that moment

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.490 align:middle line:90%
to do the light switch.

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I agree.

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Or God forbid,
they were texting.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you shouldn't
send texts and drive.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:10.756 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No, no.

00:48:10.756 --> 00:48:13.945 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: As a matter of
fact, a doctor in LA did that,

00:48:13.945 --> 00:48:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and he went over a cliff,
and he's dead because he was

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:20.875 align:middle line:84%
sending text messages
will driving.

00:48:20.875 --> 00:48:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And put his head down,
and he went right over.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: That's just, well, OK.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:25.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.415 align:middle line:84%
No, no amount of white
light can change that.

00:48:27.415 --> 00:48:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's not smart.

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:29.350 align:middle line:90%
You don't do that.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.925 align:middle line:84%
But I see where
you're headed at,

00:48:31.925 --> 00:48:34.390 align:middle line:84%
that people are
upset constantly.

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.090 align:middle line:84%
We're in an era,
right now, where

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:38.821 align:middle line:84%
more people are uptight
than ever before.

00:48:38.821 --> 00:48:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Totally stressed out.

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Completely and
utterly stressed out.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:43.528 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So how can
they, like in the morning,

00:48:43.528 --> 00:48:46.270 align:middle line:84%
how can everybody in the morning
just try to put a little white

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:48.154 align:middle line:90%
light around themselves?

00:48:48.154 --> 00:48:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I think just
focusing on white light.

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Just saying white light.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been in a
number of situations.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is how, essentially,
the name White Light Express

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:57.810 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:02.670 align:middle line:84%
But we were in a situation,
in Big Sur, in a truck.

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was sliding backwards
in the middle of a storm.

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:07.745 align:middle line:90%
And my sister leaned forward.

00:49:07.745 --> 00:49:10.620 align:middle line:84%
She was just like white light,
white light, white light.

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting, because
the truck kind of turned,

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and we were able to
get some traction

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.724 align:middle line:84%
and keep moving as the
road fell away behind us.

00:49:18.724 --> 00:49:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of looked at
her, and I said, well,

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.723 align:middle line:84%
you know, that white light
stuff, it really works.

00:49:22.723 --> 00:49:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, oh,
you bet it does.

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it started.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, if you
know that you're

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:31.910 align:middle line:84%
going to have a really
stressful day at work,

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:35.350 align:middle line:84%
or if, you know, you're
going to be in a situation,

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.170 align:middle line:84%
even just if you're going to
the hospital for a procedure,

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:40.950 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, send white
light to yourself.

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Just surround yourself
in white light.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Bring down the light.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And imagine yourself
being in a cocoon

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:50.280 align:middle line:90%
of beautiful white light.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.000 align:middle line:90%
That's all you have to do.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.670 align:middle line:84%
You don't have any-- you
don't have to do any ritual.

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I do the ritual
because I enjoy it.

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I like having a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:00.950 align:middle line:90%
To me, it makes sense.

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:02.980 align:middle line:90%
It's like reading a book.

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now people
who don't know,

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.280 align:middle line:84%
people who don't
understand this, I mean,

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:10.520 align:middle line:84%
would they see what you do or
hear what you do and go, whoa!

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.024 align:middle line:90%
White light?

00:50:11.024 --> 00:50:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: All the time.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.757 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What are we
talking about here?

00:50:13.757 --> 00:50:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah.

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.480 align:middle line:84%
No, that happens
all the time, which

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.240 align:middle line:84%
is why I'm really, really
working, for the last 11 years

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.156 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing
this-- I've been doing it

00:50:21.156 --> 00:50:22.980 align:middle line:84%
11 years-- on my
elevator speech.

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I truly just can't
seem to dial it down

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.342 align:middle line:90%
to just a few simple sentences.

00:50:27.342 --> 00:50:29.425 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: People won't
talk to you on an elevator.

00:50:29.425 --> 00:50:31.645 align:middle line:90%
They'll think you're crazy.

00:50:31.645 --> 00:50:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Go to New York and talk to
somebody on an elevator.

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: You want to know
what I do on elevators?

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I turn to everybody
and I say, I bet

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:40.100 align:middle line:84%
you're wondering why I've
gathered you here today.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I hand out
my business cards.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And what do they do?

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.704 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: They laugh,
and it breaks the ice.

00:50:45.704 --> 00:50:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I bet you don't
get some people who laugh.

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I bet you get some people who
are a little angry about that.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I haven't
been to New York yet.

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Go there.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Hand out your
business cards on an elevator.

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:56.422 align:middle line:90%
You'll see.

00:50:56.422 --> 00:50:58.130 align:middle line:84%
You'll have them stuck
all over your body

00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:59.144 align:middle line:90%
before the doors open.

00:50:59.144 --> 00:51:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, the
bottom line is,

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.030 align:middle line:84%
is that I am incredibly
centered and focused.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'm fabulously psychic.

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So I would know
whether or not I was

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.661 align:middle line:84%
going to get plastered with
my business cards back at me.

00:51:09.661 --> 00:51:10.285 align:middle line:90%
Like, you know?

00:51:10.285 --> 00:51:12.243 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can you do a
little meditation prayer

00:51:12.243 --> 00:51:12.890 align:middle line:90%
for everybody?

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I would love to.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:15.600 align:middle line:90%
I would absolutely love to.

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How do you do that?

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:16.604 align:middle line:90%
What we do?

00:51:16.604 --> 00:51:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: You can just
sit where you are.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has to stand up.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.030 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
raise your hands,

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:26.860 align:middle line:84%
unless you are
impressed to do that.

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.510 align:middle line:90%
To me, every moment is church.

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.380 align:middle line:84%
To me, God is present
in every moment.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:34.760 align:middle line:84%
When you take a walk outside,
or whatever you're doing,

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.170 align:middle line:90%
there you are.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But basically, I think
it's very important to just

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:43.139 align:middle line:84%
kind of center and
focus yourself.

00:51:43.139 --> 00:51:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, they don't
know how to center and focus.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
what grounding is.

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I say, just put your
feet together on the ground,

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.090 align:middle line:90%
and put them side by side.

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Kind of sit up.

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Straighten up your
spine just a little bit.

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
in through your nose.

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Out through your mouth.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can have your hands
however you're comfortable.

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I always just like
to kind of put them,

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:13.670 align:middle line:84%
I like to touch my
thumbs together, like so.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And I just like
to close my eyes.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
bring down the light,

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I just say, Heavenly
Father, Heavenly Mother,

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.090 align:middle line:84%
thank you for this opportunity
to express my gratitude to you.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for this
opportunity I have

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:30.240 align:middle line:84%
to ask you to spread
white light around me,

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and all the people that
I will be with today.

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Follow around the
people in my life

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:40.750 align:middle line:84%
that I love and the
people I have yet to meet.

00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Bless us all with safety,
health, abundance, love,

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.670 align:middle line:90%
prosperity, and joy.

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And we say these things in
the name of white light, amen.

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And then
you start your day.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I do.

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it generally makes
it a better day for people?

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: It makes it a
heck of a great day for me.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, can you say
just about anything you want?

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:07.163 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I think so.

00:53:07.163 --> 00:53:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
important to really

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.300 align:middle line:84%
speak out loud your
desires and your wants.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.142 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you do that,
what are you connecting to?

00:53:16.142 --> 00:53:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: You know, there's this
center inside of me that lives

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.800 align:middle line:90%
right here in my heart.

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.570 align:middle line:90%
And I can feel my heart expand.

00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you imagine the
Grinch, when at the very end,

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:28.880 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows the story
of Dr. Seuss and "The Grinch

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Who Stole Christmas."

00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can feel my heart
expand just a little bit more,

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.840 align:middle line:84%
exponentially, each
time I do that.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:40.386 align:middle line:84%
And I would hope that I
would be able to carry

00:53:40.386 --> 00:53:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that energy with me
throughout the day.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's also sort of
like a-- and you know,

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a big promoter
of guilt, either.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.970 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the reasons
why I left religion behind.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think there's
anything between us and God.

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe that shame
should be a way of motivation.

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But if I set my intention
at the beginning of the day,

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:05.480 align:middle line:84%
I sort of have a goal with
myself to maintain that flow.

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So I have to sort of
remind myself, oh, yeah.

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:11.394 align:middle line:84%
I promised myself I was going
be a decent person today.

00:54:11.394 --> 00:54:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:15.136 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: And then other
people say, you know, Sarah,

00:54:15.136 --> 00:54:16.010 align:middle line:90%
you're so darn perky.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.270 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I want to shoot you.

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And I say, ah,
come on over here.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you how to do that.

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So when
people are praying,

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:27.340 align:middle line:84%
exactly this consciousness,
what are they connecting into?

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.490 align:middle line:90%
What are they tapping into?

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I believe
it's a higher energy.

00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:34.840 align:middle line:90%
It's an energy source.

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:39.580 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine the earth as
surrounded by a biosphere

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:42.260 align:middle line:84%
of energy, of air
that we can breathe,

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and then further out it's--
there are layers of energy that

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.030 align:middle line:90%
create our reality.

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we can
tap into a cosmic flow.

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there are
scientific measurements.

00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:00.080 align:middle line:90%
And for example, an EMF.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:04.421 align:middle line:84%
People talk about EMFs, and they
talk about microwaves and radio

00:55:04.421 --> 00:55:04.920 align:middle line:90%
waves.

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.378 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Constantly
bombarding us.

00:55:06.378 --> 00:55:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Constantly
bombarding us.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Who's to say that your a prayer
request isn't part of that EMF?

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
it's part of energy.

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Indeed.

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's got to
be connected somehow.

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: It has to be.

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.660 align:middle line:90%
It has to be.

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know, again,
I had somebody ask me

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.249 align:middle line:84%
about the White
Light Express lasso.

00:55:23.249 --> 00:55:24.790 align:middle line:84%
How do I know that
my energy is going

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:26.670 align:middle line:90%
to go where I am directing it?

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe that there's a
divine spark within each of us.

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And we are transmitters of
huge focal points of power.

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
we can say, I would

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:40.640 align:middle line:90%
like this energy to go here.

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.920 align:middle line:84%
I would like this
energy to go here.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Psychics, clairvoyants,
mediums, they

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:48.300 align:middle line:84%
are able to tap
into those lines.

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.800 align:middle line:90%
It's like a cell phone.

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I always like
to use the example, Sarah,

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.810 align:middle line:90%
of a radio transmission.

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:58.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't see the radio
waves, but they're there.

00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:00.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't hear the
radio transmission

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:03.390 align:middle line:84%
until you have your
radio receiver.

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:05.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's much like a person.

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:09.350 align:middle line:84%
If they can pick this
up, if they can send it,

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:10.800 align:middle line:90%
it's going to work for them.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, that's why I
believe in the White Light

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Express grid.

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, the
White Light Express grid

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:22.140 align:middle line:84%
is the cell phone
receiving end of the radio

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:26.860 align:middle line:84%
waves of positive
energy and healing needs

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and manifestation
and transformation

00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:32.160 align:middle line:90%
requests that are going out.

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe that all the
Guardians of the Grid,

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:37.660 align:middle line:90%
it will get focused here.

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:41.609 align:middle line:84%
And I can't prove it, but I can
prove how a cell phone works.

00:56:41.609 --> 00:56:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Now try explaining a
cell phone to somebody

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.280 align:middle line:90%
in the medieval days.

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:44.946 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:56:44.946 --> 00:56:46.020 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't work.

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No.

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wouldn't work.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Or a submarine or
something like that.

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I believe that this
next generation of children

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:56.750 align:middle line:84%
will be able to tell us more
and be able to tap into it with

00:56:56.750 --> 00:57:01.060 align:middle line:84%
more frequency and with
better accuracy than we can.

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.790 align:middle line:84%
As our understanding
of this type of science

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:09.950 align:middle line:84%
really becomes more mainstream,
instead of, oh, that's

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:11.460 align:middle line:90%
just a bunch of hodgepodge.

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:14.050 align:middle line:84%
That's just a bunch
of hocus pocus.

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that that great
big war out there,

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.280 align:middle line:84%
between the light
and the dark, is

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:23.310 align:middle line:84%
going to become--
it's going to end.

00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Because a single speck
of light can dispel

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:28.450 align:middle line:90%
an entire universe of darkness.

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And that person
who surrounds themselves with

00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:35.270 align:middle line:84%
energy, you can feel it
from them, wherever they go.

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:39.140 align:middle line:84%
You can tell when someone
walks into a room what kind

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:42.980 align:middle line:84%
of energy level they have,
because they just give it off.

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.260 align:middle line:90%
It's infectious.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: You do.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, I do, sometimes.

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes.

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:50.180 align:middle line:84%
I would say that you
definitely an agent of light.

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:51.513 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, but I'm a robot.

00:57:51.513 --> 00:57:55.026 align:middle line:90%


00:57:55.026 --> 00:58:00.480 align:middle line:84%
But it is so important to shed
yourself in that white light.

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And until I had you on "Coast
to Coast" several months ago,

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.800 align:middle line:90%
I understood it was there.

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't understand
exactly what it was.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:10.970 align:middle line:90%
I do now.

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And you were able to
allow me to do that.

00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: That's fabulous.

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:15.920 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible information.

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So good luck
with everything you do.

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Keep the white light going
for all of us, if you would,

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:22.980 align:middle line:84%
because I have a feeling
we're all going to need it.

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: It's my life's work.

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.911 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Ladies and
gentlemen, Sarah Nash.

00:58:25.911 --> 00:58:27.094 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Sarah.

00:58:27.094 --> 00:58:30.870 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: She was 12 years
old, 12 years old when she had

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.970 align:middle line:84%
the experience of
the white light.

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:39.490 align:middle line:90%
And it changed her life.

00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:41.830 align:middle line:90%
And maybe it'll change yours.

00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.180 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:47.880 align:middle line:90%
