00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:21.310 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Debra Martin is
with us, a world-renowned healer

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.640 align:middle line:10%
and International Research
Lab-certified medium

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:10%
and the author of six books.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.375 align:middle line:84%
Debra, welcome back
to the program.

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBRA MARTIN: Oh, gosh,
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always
great seeing you.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.339 align:middle line:90%
How have you been?

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:34.132 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'm doing
really well, Thank you.

00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:34.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's new?

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Oh, I'm just doing
a lot of healings these days

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.425 align:middle line:84%
and just enjoying
life in the meantime.

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when
we say healings,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:90%
what do we mean by that?

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: Healings
mean that I'm doing

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.220 align:middle line:10%
a remote healing for anybody
that's around the world.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:10%
They can be anywhere.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:84%
That's dealing with
emotional, physical,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual struggles, illness.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.830 align:middle line:10%
And so I tap into a frequency
of healing and energy

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:10%
that I call God's
frequency healing energy.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:90%
And it goes through me.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And they can be anywhere in
the world, like you said,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.030 align:middle line:90%
and it travels to them.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel their
pain or their illness?

00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Sometimes I do.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in my
actual healing room,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I will see spiritual
surgeons come into the room.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.080 align:middle line:84%
I might feel angels
come into the room.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I might feel a loved
one come into the room.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I might feel God
come into the room.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So if a spiritual surgeon is
going to do a surgery on me,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to feel the
area they're working on.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, my client will not
feel any of that pain,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
but they might feel the
emotion of that love that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:90%
enters the room.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.956 align:middle line:84%
You yourself had some episodes,
three near-death experiences.

00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, I've
had three near-death.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.772 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us what
happened in each one.

00:01:48.772 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: OK, so my first
NDE, I was in a car accident.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And I was on a
freeway where I was hit,

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and we spun out and took
40 feet of guardrail.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And so when we came to a stop,
we were in oncoming traffic.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.817 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, when you're
looking at oncoming traffic

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to get out
of the car, we're panicking.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.083 align:middle line:90%
We can't get out.

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god, yeah.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And so a
gentleman came to the door.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And he lifted all three
of us, each one by one,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:84%
opened it effortlessly, and
took us to the embankment.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And when fire trucks came,
police came to the scene.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:90%
He was nowhere to be found.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And so at that moment, I was
like, well, who was that?

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I later learned that that
was divine intervention, came

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.720 align:middle line:84%
in human form,
saved me, and that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:90%
really opened my spirituality.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He saved you.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.055 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: He saved me.

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:50.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was he?

00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I say that
that was divine intervention

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that God brought down
here in human form.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you call
him a spirit surgeon?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I wouldn't call
him a spiritual surgeon.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.522 align:middle line:84%
No, I would just call him an
angel that came in disguise.

00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the second NDE?

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So the
second NDE was when

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I was also in a car accident.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:84%
But in this one, I
was sitting in a turn

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
bay ready to go
into a neighborhood.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I had no reason to think
that I was going to be hit.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't worried.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:90%
I was just sitting in my car.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I'm out of my body.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm looking
down and seeing

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:84%
what is transpiring, that this
truck is going to come over

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:90%
my car and crush me.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You haven't had
much luck with cars, Debbie.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Jeez.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I hope I'm done now.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.718 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the third time?

00:03:48.718 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: OK, so
the second one, that

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:84%
opened my abilities as a
medium, because I heard spirit

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
say, are you ready?

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I said, are you
ready, then I said no.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, I
was back into my car

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.115 align:middle line:90%
with a mouth full of glass.

00:04:05.115 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.015 align:middle line:90%
That was number two.

00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That was number two.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.197 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Number three?

00:04:10.197 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Number three,
this time, I was really sick.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:90%
I was down to, like 90 pounds.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was being
seen at Mayo Clinic.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And doctors couldn't figure
out what was wrong with me.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I was in so much pain that I
couldn't eat or drink anything

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:84%
without being in so
much pain like you're

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:84%
having a baby, that kind,
curled up in a fetus position.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened then is I
was asking God, just take me,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:90%
just take me.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:90%
I have no dignity here.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm laying in bed,
and I'm in pain.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You wanted to go?

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I wanted to go.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Deb.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, there
just wasn't any quality

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:90%
of life at this point.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.550 align:middle line:90%
So one morning, I woke up.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And there were spiritual
surgeons in my room.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, being a medium,
I wasn't afraid

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:90%
of those spiritual surgeons.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And they started to work on me.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
maybe God is here

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.630 align:middle line:84%
to heal me through these
spiritual surgeons.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it
being super painful.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.775 align:middle line:84%
And when it was that
painful, I was like,

00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I know I have to
go through this,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.957 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know if I
can go through this.

00:05:16.957 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, I'm going to
remove my mind from the pain

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:90%
by taking a deep breath.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And just when I took a deep
breath in and I let it out,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.880 align:middle line:84%
that's when I came out of
my body and transcended.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:90%
And I remember floating up.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had an
OBE, a classic OBE.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And as I was floating
up, I can remember, wow,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:90%
this feels great.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you dying?

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I wasn't
sure what I was doing.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I just felt like I'm
removed from my body.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm in this space where
I'm feeling no pain,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and I came to a space that was
all white all the way around me.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- it looked
like there were clouds.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK, I'm here.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:90%
What next?

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this being
come towards me.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized that love,
and that love was God.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did these episodes give
you the ability as a healer?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes,
this third one did.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I was told to come back with
a new mission and a new duty,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and that opened my
healing abilities.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.355 align:middle line:90%
I was given the gift.

00:06:20.355 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly?

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, it
took six months.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So when I came
back into my body,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I can remember coming back
in and kind of feeling

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.950 align:middle line:90%
like I went into my body.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And I took a breath
like coming out,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.972 align:middle line:84%
like if you were
held under water.

00:06:33.972 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
what just happened?

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Am I the same person?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
It took about six months of
me walking through my healing

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:90%
and seeing how healing works.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And God was showing
me how healing works.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.055 align:middle line:84%
And then I had the ability
and this strong knowingness

00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that this is what
I needed to do.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you weren't out
of your body for six months,

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:90%
were you?

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:54.845 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No, no, no.

00:06:54.845 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I was only out of that probably
for an hour, I would say.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do you
think about these experiences?

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I believe that
each one of those experiences

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:90%
molded me into who I am today.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have each
one of those experiences,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be the
healer who I am.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
afraid of dying?

00:07:12.425 --> 00:07:13.845 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'm not
afraid of dying.

00:07:13.845 --> 00:07:15.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're in no rush.

00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I'm not in any rush.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
No I don't want to
die any time soon.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aren't you
glad you didn't pass on

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:90%
on the third time?

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I am now.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
When I look back and
say, wow, look at all

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.570 align:middle line:84%
the life that I've lived between
that time and where I am today

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and all the people that
I get to help and meet,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.145 align:middle line:90%
I feel very blessed.

00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who heals?

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Is it you?

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Is it an angel through you?

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Is it God?

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.725 align:middle line:90%
Who's doing it?

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Well, I call it God.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So other people might
say source divine.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.940 align:middle line:84%
They might have
another name for it.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that it's God's
love, frequency, and energy

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.005 align:middle line:84%
that is working through
me to heal them.

00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you
do group healings.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.303 align:middle line:90%
And you do private healings.

00:07:58.303 --> 00:07:59.220 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.308 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: OK, so in a
private healing session,

00:08:02.308 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:84%
you can have a private
session, and you can

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:90%
have a private reading session.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So in a private session,
it's an individual session

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:90%
where somebody will contact me.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And they might tell me
what their illness is,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.415 align:middle line:90%
or they might tell me that--

00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you need
to know what it is?

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, I don't
need to know it all.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And so then what I do
is I go into prayer.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I go on
to my healing table

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:90%
where I have a picture of them.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And I place it on my abdomen
where I become their proxy.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, I might have
an IV go in me because there's

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:84%
going to be a spiritual
surgeon doing this,

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:90%
which is giving me a sedation.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
They might feel the
sedation on their end.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And now they're in
their sacred space.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:84%
They could be in
another country.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:90%
They could be sleeping.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter where
they are at this time.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And so then the energy
starts to come through me.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they have a
reading attached to that,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be connecting
to a loved one at that time.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So I bring their loved
one into the session.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.845 align:middle line:84%
And I also connect with them
before the session begins.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, so with my group
healings, my group healings

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:16.260 align:middle line:84%
is where we gather people from
all around the world as one.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And our intention is
we all want a miracle.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you do it by Zoom?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:90%
How do you do it?

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:90%
No,

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Everything is
remote, so it's distant.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:90%
You're in your sacred space.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.415 align:middle line:84%
I auto record everything,
and then I send it to them.

00:09:30.415 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
have to see them?

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I do
not see them ever.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:90%
I just have their picture.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.732 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing with
that is some people

00:09:38.732 --> 00:09:39.690 align:middle line:90%
tell me what they want.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So I put that in my prayer,
but I don't limit it

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:90%
to just those issues.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Some people tell me nothing.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:84%
But in the group session, it
always seems to have a theme.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.640 align:middle line:90%
God comes up with a theme.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:90%
So they build on themselves.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.060 align:middle line:84%
People might come
more than once.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:10%
People might come
where they feel like,

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:10%
oh, I need it two
months from now.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they
want to rebalance.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.170 align:middle line:84%
But the groups are really
powerful and profound.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of
miracles through them.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.342 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is truly
remarkable, what you've done.

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:10.175 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Thank you.

00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:13.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
ever exhaust you?

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, it
can exhaust me.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I never know.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.112 align:middle line:90%
After a healing session--

00:10:17.112 --> 00:10:18.375 align:middle line:90%
I only do one session a day.

00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:20.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It wore
Edgar Cayce down.

00:10:20.175 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I
know Edgar Cayce.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:22.940 align:middle line:90%
I know--

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.732 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You ever worry
about that for you?

00:10:24.732 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I do a lot
to try to prepare myself

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:90%
so that that doesn't happen.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I will only do
one session a day,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:36.532 align:middle line:84%
and so I really give
my all to the session.

00:10:36.532 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm done
with the session,

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:84%
if I'm tired, if it took
everything out of me,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:90%
then I know, OK, I need to rest.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I need to honor my
body, how I'm feeling.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I might
feel nothing at all.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.586 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I will
feel extremely exhausted.

00:10:50.586 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
Gwendolyn and what she did.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Oh, Gwendolyn.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:90%
I loved Gwendolyn.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:90%
She's a doll.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So Gwendolyn, I knew nothing
about Gwendolyn when she came.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:84%
She was coming for a
private reading session.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So she wanted to connect
with her deceased cat.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, I knew
nothing about Gwendolyn.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So when I went into the
session with Gwendolyn,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.040 align:middle line:90%
God came through.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And he started
going to her heart.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of pain,
a lot of suffering,

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.580 align:middle line:84%
a lot of heaviness that
needed to be removed.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.116 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember God telling
her, it's OK to love yourself.

00:11:27.116 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is dramatic.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:84%
What transpired in her healing
that was life changing?

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: With
Gwendolyn, what God

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.440 align:middle line:84%
did is He took us on
a spiritual journey.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.292 align:middle line:84%
Now a spiritual journey is
like I get a vision in my mind.

00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Some people will feel
like they're having

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.285 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience.

00:11:44.285 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Some people will feel
like they're just

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:84%
watching a movie in their mind
as I am speaking it to them.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So with Gwendolyn, we
went to this space.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And when we were in this
space, her cat showed up.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Her cat angel showed up.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Her cat showed up?

00:11:58.075 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, and I
remember it pounced on me.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:90%
I just felt this like this.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:90%
So I'm on the table.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Plus, I'm in this
other dimension.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I feel this cat jump,
and I start laughing.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, my gosh, I love--

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a
crazy person, right?

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:11.767 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, right.

00:12:11.767 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm really feeling this.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.590 align:middle line:90%
But then it made it so real.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Like, we're really all together.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:90%
We're all one.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And then the cat just sat
right here in this other space.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:90%
So I'm witnessing this all.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And the cat just
transformed into a woman.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:90%
And now the woman--

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, now the woman
standing in front of Gwendolyn

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and says to Gwendolyn,
we've been together

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:90%
for many, many lifetimes.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And we will continue
to be together.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to enjoy your
life knowing that I'm fine here,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.915 align:middle line:90%
but I'm also there with you.

00:12:49.915 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
a video of Gwendolyn

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.275 align:middle line:84%
reacting to the moment her cat
angel appeared in her healing

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.075 align:middle line:90%
session.

00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GWENDOLYN: Like, after
the death of Angel,

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.800 align:middle line:84%
which is my cat,
who you actually

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
got to be in the
session with me,

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of
grief around it.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And I actually didn't
want to live after that.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.440 align:middle line:90%
So I was actually suicidal.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, I just didn't
want to live anymore.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:84%
But for you to bring her
in and whatever she said to

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
me actually saved
my life, actually.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you said about
me was absolutely right.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:90%
It's like you knew me.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I want to
live now because I'm--

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
since I think about
eight years ago,

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I've always-- from
when I was a child,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I always loved animals
more than humans.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I could
feel their suffering.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:90%
And then as I got older--

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:84%
so I turned vegan and all
that just for the animals.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And just watching, knowing
that the pain and suffering was

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.990 align:middle line:84%
existing in this
world, sometimes I

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:90%
felt I couldn't do anything.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- and just
didn't want to live anymore.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.830 align:middle line:90%
So you actually saved my life.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:84%
But after that session, I just
felt that I can do something.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:84%
I just do my part bit
by bit, and I will.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I just felt this
oneness with everything.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So I could be a light, even if
it's a small one, to help out.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying little by
little now to love myself more.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I felt that
God got near me.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.247 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't alone.

00:14:42.247 --> 00:14:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going to
hear more from Gwendolyn--

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:90%
this segment several times.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:90%
But did she try to harm herself?

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: She just
stopped eating.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:84%
She self-sabotaged
herself by not eating.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So she only ate
rice for two years.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:90%
She just wanted enough energy.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.590 align:middle line:90%
She didn't want nutrition.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And then after the
healing session,

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.840 align:middle line:84%
even hearing this today,
hearing it again, hearing it

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.040 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, I
become very emotional.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: And then--

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.927 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You saved her life.

00:15:11.927 --> 00:15:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --to hear those
words that came through

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and that she felt
that embrace from God,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing more profound.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just so grateful
that that transpired for her.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So after that, she
started eating.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.045 align:middle line:84%
She's eating and
doing really well.

00:15:31.045 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you keep
in touch with her?

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I do.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does she
know you saved her?

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's what she says.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't like to
say that I saved her.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:90%
God saved her.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.398 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:15:41.398 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
were a part of it.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I was the
instrument, exactly.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe the cat
a little bit, too, right?

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I think
the cat did a lot.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did Gwendolyn's
cat manifest in her healing?

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, that's how she
manifested it into that woman,

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:84%
where I think that was a
very profound moment for her.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Gwendolyn explained it
like, hard to imagine,

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:84%
but she knew in
her heart was true,

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
because it is so far out
there that the cat changed

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
into a woman and had those
profound words for her.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are entities ever
part of these healing sessions,

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:90%
outside entities?

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Here's a
video of Gwendolyn

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:84%
reacting to the moment her cat
appeared in her healing session.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: One of the things that
was said to you or shown to you

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
is to take you on a
spiritual journey.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you were in this space,
which I had no idea that angel

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:84%
would show up this
way, the angel

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:84%
shows up first and just
pounces into your arms.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you heard that,
did you feel that?

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.957 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.957 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GWENDOLYN: I don't know.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.125 align:middle line:90%
I was just crying nonstop.

00:16:57.125 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:90%
So I--

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: So you--

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.432 align:middle line:84%
>>GWENDOLYN: I felt
everything, yeah.

00:17:00.432 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, I could feel it.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- as I'm witnessing
it and going through it,

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I wanted to cry.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh my gosh, this is true
love, unconditional, true love.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
angel takes a seat next to you

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and turns into, like,
being, a woman and said,

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:90%
it is who you think I am.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:90%
And we've met many, many lives.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And our magnetics will
always connect no matter

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:90%
where we are in the world.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
We'll find each other
from lifetime to lifetime.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and that she's
always with you.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I love the time where
you-- then you two got to talk.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.792 align:middle line:84%
And then when she left, an
angel came and sat on your lap.

00:17:52.792 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GWENDOLYN: Yeah,
I mean, it's so hard

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:84%
to actually understand
all that because we just

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.010 align:middle line:90%
live in this dimension.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't-- it's so hard
to comprehend all that.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:90%
But I felt it.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
have to understand,

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:90%
but I just know that--

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:90%
I just knew it.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.362 align:middle line:90%
I felt it within me.

00:18:13.362 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You felt
it to be true?

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GWENDOLYN: Yeah.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, and
that's one of the things

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:84%
that I have written here is I
know this is really hard for you

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.815 align:middle line:84%
But in this dimension, there's
so much more than what we know.

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gwendolyn seems
like a different person.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Totally
different person.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Her mother is the
one that actually

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.630 align:middle line:90%
wanted her to have the session.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And so she--

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mother was smart.

00:18:38.355 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Her mother is so
grateful to see her daughter now

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:90%
living and thriving.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And she just wants to be kind
to others and love her cats.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.686 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important was the
cat in this entire episode?

00:18:51.686 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The cat was
in the spiritual journey

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:84%
a big, big part of
the healing session.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So the healing sessions
usually lasts about an hour.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the cat was
there before the session began,

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.160 align:middle line:84%
during the session,
but also then she

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.625 align:middle line:84%
was receiving these
words from God as well.

00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find that
pets reincarnate with us

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:90%
across multiple lifelines?

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I do.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:19:18.445 --> 00:19:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I just believe
that their energy--

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.320 align:middle line:90%
they're filled with love.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:90%
And they just keep coming back.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I feel like-- like, with
Gwendolyn-- she explained it.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:84%
The deceased cat
explained it, the woman--

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:37.480 align:middle line:84%
as if they're magnetics, would
always meet no matter where that

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.250 align:middle line:90%
they are on this planet.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our pets are part of
our soul family, aren't they?

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, they are.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dogs, cats,
doesn't matter.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It doesn't matter.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even horses, we
feel like we know them.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about it, George,

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:57.610 align:middle line:84%
we are intuitively talking
to them all the time.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So people don't realize
how intuitive they are.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.940 align:middle line:84%
We know like, oh, they
have to go to the bathroom.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they're not feeling well.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:90%
They're sleeping too much.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:90%
We connect with them.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:90%
We're speaking with them.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes they are like
our little fur babies.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how do we
interact with the loved ones

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:84%
across these different
lines of dimensions?

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Connecting with
the spiritual loved ones?

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.215 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:20:21.215 --> 00:20:22.015 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:20:22.015 --> 00:20:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So as a medium, I'll
start connecting with them

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:84%
where I'm feeling
them, I'm sensing them.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I might be smelling
a certain fragrance.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:90%
They might be showing me signs.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So I bring that into the
session before I even

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.590 align:middle line:90%
start the healing session.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Then when we start
the healing session

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and I bring them into the
room, they might physically

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:90%
feel their touch.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.510 align:middle line:84%
They might physically see
them in their sacred space

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:90%
as I'm seeing them.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.605 align:middle line:84%
And they also
might embrace them.

00:20:50.605 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now we've talked about
how Gwendolyn has improved,

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:84%
but let's hear it from her own
words on how this has happened.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: When you were
taken on a spiritual journey

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and you listened to this,
did you feel that you

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:90%
were in a different space?

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.508 align:middle line:84%
Or did you feel like you
were just visioning it

00:21:07.508 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:90%
while you were listening to it?

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.930 align:middle line:90%
How did that make you feel?

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GWENDOLYN: I feel that
whenever I need comfort,

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I just listen to
it again and again.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so it never--

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:84%
it always feels
profound and heavenly.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.845 align:middle line:90%
It never gets, oh--

00:21:26.845 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't get tired of
listening to it ever.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:31.575 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It never
loses its essence.

00:21:31.575 --> 00:21:33.075 align:middle line:90%
>>GWENDOLYN: No, it does not.

00:21:33.075 --> 00:21:35.185 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Your mom
must be so happy.

00:21:35.185 --> 00:21:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GWENDOLYN: Yeah, she asked
me to go just for the physical

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:90%
healing because--

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nobody could
penetrate to my heart

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.165 align:middle line:84%
and try to make me
understand that--

00:21:47.165 --> 00:21:47.965 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:21:47.965 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So this went to a
whole other level for you.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GWENDOLYN: Yeah, it did.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just can't
thank you enough, Debra.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:84%
You've helped me so much,
because my self-hatred made me--

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I've only eaten rice for the
last two years because I felt--

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want any nutrition
because I didn't feel deserving.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:84%
If there's so much
suffering in the world,

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to have any
protein or any vitamins

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:90%
or nutrition.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So I just ate rice just to
have energy to get along

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:90%
and to survive.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:84%
But after that
session, I started

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.900 align:middle line:90%
eating beans and vegetables.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So my mom is really,
really, really happy.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:84%
From that day since I
received the recording,

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.020 align:middle line:84%
there isn't a day that
goes by that I actually

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:84%
don't think of a
phrase that you said

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:90%
or a sentence that you said.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't think thank you--

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.686 align:middle line:90%
that are enough, actually, yeah.

00:22:49.686 --> 00:22:52.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you record
all your sessions, Debra?

00:22:52.315 --> 00:22:53.197 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I do.

00:22:53.197 --> 00:22:54.030 align:middle line:90%
I record everything.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How important is that?

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's really
important that they're recorded

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and they hold that
frequency in healing

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.770 align:middle line:84%
so they can listen to
this session as many times

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:04.700 align:middle line:90%
as they wish.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the first time
they listen to it,

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:90%
they might be analyzing it.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.290 align:middle line:84%
They might not just be
sitting in that space.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.663 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they are just
sitting in that space,

00:23:11.663 --> 00:23:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
really hearing it.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
They're just being
part of that frequency.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So having it recorded, they can
go listen to it over and over

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.880 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.325 align:middle line:84%
It's like having a healing
session over and over again.

00:23:20.325 --> 00:23:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is J'amy?

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: OK, J'amy came for a
healing reading session as well.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, J'amy shared a
few things with me

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:10%
that she wanted to be healed.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:84%
She was dealing with foggy
brain and low energy.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:84%
So physically, she
expressed that.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.265 align:middle line:84%
But she also wanted to
connect with her deceased mom.

00:23:40.265 --> 00:23:41.065 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:23:41.065 --> 00:23:43.235 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you do that, too.

00:23:43.235 --> 00:23:45.085 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I did
that as well, yes.

00:23:45.085 --> 00:23:46.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what
was the outcome?

00:23:46.775 --> 00:23:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: In J'amy's
session, what was so amazing

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.770 align:middle line:84%
is right from the beginning--
because I tell you

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that I'm connecting with J'amy's
mom before the session begins.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.565 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember going, OK,
J'amy spells her name J'amy.

00:23:59.565 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Am I supposed to say "Ja-amy"?

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Or am I supposed to say "Jamie"?

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, I
was like, mhm, how am I

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:90%
supposed to say her name?

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, you won't believe this.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.330 align:middle line:84%
The mother dropped
that into J'amy's head

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:90%
while she was taking a shower.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.290 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't know how
to say your name.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So J'amy's washing her
hair and going, oh my gosh,

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.140 align:middle line:84%
she doesn't know
how to say my name.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know that that
was coming from her mom.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So she gets out of the shower
all soapy, grabs her phone,

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.880 align:middle line:90%
emails me--

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.790 align:middle line:84%
You're probably wondering
how to say my name.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Now that happened
within one minute.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:43.850 align:middle line:90%
I received the email.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.215 align:middle line:84%
Ding, I'm like,
got to be kidding.

00:24:46.215 --> 00:24:47.590 align:middle line:84%
At that moment,
I'm like, this is

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:90%
going to be an awesome session.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Mom.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.585 align:middle line:90%
I now know how to say J'amy.

00:24:51.585 --> 00:24:52.465 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:52.465 --> 00:24:53.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:24:53.445 --> 00:24:54.487 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It was amazing.

00:24:54.487 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debra, what did you
see on your spiritual journey

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.840 align:middle line:84%
in regards to a
woman holding a baby?

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.692 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: OK, so that was a
really, really important part

00:25:04.692 --> 00:25:05.650 align:middle line:10%
of the healing session.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With her?

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, so
now, J'amy's going

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.492 align:middle line:84%
to go on a spiritual
journey with me.

00:25:12.492 --> 00:25:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And God has said, I'm taking
you on this spiritual journey.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.570 align:middle line:90%
And we go to this space.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.970 align:middle line:84%
When we get to this space, I
see her mother standing there.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I see her
mother standing there,

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I see her holding this baby.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And now I question-- in
my mind, I'm questioning.

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.043 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying this
on the recording.

00:25:28.043 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:90%
I question in my mind.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And I say, mm, is that a baby
that's going to come to J'amy?

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Or did J'amy lose that baby?

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.800 align:middle line:90%
And I have no idea.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.925 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intriguing.

00:25:36.925 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Right, I have no idea.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:90%
But I know that J'amy will know.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK, well,
let me be more specific.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Is this a boy or a girl?

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:90%
And I hear this is a baby boy.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.580 align:middle line:90%
So I voiced that.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Your mother is
holding a baby boy.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And then they let me get closer.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And the baby was
wrapped in blue.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:90%
So validated it for me.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:03.010 align:middle line:84%
What's so profound with that is
it was very relatable to J'amy.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: J'amy, of course, talks
about the baby in her healing

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.640 align:middle line:90%
session.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So we went
on this future journey.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And I saw your mom
holding this baby,

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:90%
and they were very specific.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:90%
They said, this is a baby boy.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>J'AMY: We had lost a baby
boy in the first trimester.

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So it was so important
to know and so

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:84%
healing to know that even though
he did not come, he was alive.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:90%
He was a soul.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:90%
He is still a baby.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And Mom's taking care
of him until we can all

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:90%
be together again.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was just such a
beautiful confirmation.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And J'amy
lost that baby.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: She did lose the baby.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.280 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you knew that?

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I didn't know.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Remember I wasn't too sure.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:90%
I was just--

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you
sounded like you knew.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I felt like I
knew she had the baby.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:51.948 align:middle line:90%
I knew the mother held the baby.

00:26:51.948 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't sure if that
baby was being held and taken

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.890 align:middle line:84%
care of by the mom
at that moment,

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.670 align:middle line:84%
or if that baby
was coming to her.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that
J'amy would know.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And it impacted her knowing
that her mom was holding

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:90%
that baby that she lost.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It did
deeply, too, I bet.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:90%
How did it affect her?

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.645 align:middle line:90%
In a positive way?

00:27:09.645 --> 00:27:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
yeah, because now she

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.100 align:middle line:84%
knows that baby is still
alive and that they'll

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:84%
be together again someday
and that her mom's

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.060 align:middle line:90%
watching over this child.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.265 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often does
the mother come to J'amy?

00:27:20.265 --> 00:27:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, OK,
so in the beginning,

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.400 align:middle line:84%
before the healing
session, J'amy kind of

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.100 align:middle line:84%
like-- if she felt that her
mom was going to be there,

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:84%
she thought that her
mom was angry with her.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was always
a sad, heavy thing

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:35.700 align:middle line:90%
if she even thought of her mom.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:84%
She went through a
very traumatic passing

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:90%
with her mother.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And so after the
session, now that she's

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.070 align:middle line:84%
connecting with her
mom and the healing

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:84%
that her mom gave her
during that session,

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.357 align:middle line:84%
she now has a new
relationship with her.

00:27:52.357 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it normal
for your clients

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.710 align:middle line:84%
to physically feel what you
feel during these healings?

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Do they pick up on you?

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK, so--

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or do you
pick up on them?

00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I'm
always picking up on them.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:08.790 align:middle line:84%
But with J'amy's session,
this was so remarkable.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I all of a sudden feel
like I can't move my legs.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.910 align:middle line:90%
From the waist down--

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You feel paralyzed?

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah,
there's no movement.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:16.115 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:28:16.115 --> 00:28:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you scared?

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.797 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --I know
that I've had--

00:28:17.797 --> 00:28:20.490 align:middle line:84%
no, I'm just like, OK, they must
have gave me enough medicine

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to just knock this part out
where I have no feeling.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:84%
But all of a
sudden, a little cat

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.000 align:middle line:84%
comes to my toes
and touches my toes.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:29.800 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like--

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you could feel it.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, so
I'm like, is this

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.510 align:middle line:84%
a deceased cat that
she lost, or is this

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:40.060 align:middle line:84%
a real cat that I'm feeling
that's by J'amy on her end

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:90%
where she's at?

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.600 align:middle line:90%
So I voiced all of this.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So J'amy decides to
listen to her session

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.122 align:middle line:90%
after she gets her kids down.

00:28:50.122 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And so she's-- this is hours
after the session took place.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So J'amy now goes
into the session.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And she's feeling and hearing
everything that I'm saying.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:90%
And her legs become numb.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Her cat is at the bottom of
her foot tickling her foot,

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.630 align:middle line:90%
and she's chewing it.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:08.922 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you're feeling it.

00:29:08.922 --> 00:29:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And I felt
it hours before.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: So then it--

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.510 align:middle line:90%
here, she's feeling it.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:84%
It just shows us there's
really no matter of time.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Time is not our issue
and that energy travels.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And it waits there
for her to receive it.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:28.146 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that was such
an amazing validation.

00:29:28.146 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that happen with
even seeing deceased loved ones?

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Do the clients pick
up on that as well?

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:34.622 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, they do.

00:29:34.622 --> 00:29:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll
feel their touch.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.288 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they'll smell them.

00:29:37.288 --> 00:29:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll actually
see them next to them.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How quickly do
the people who pass on

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.880 align:middle line:90%
try to reach out to a medium?

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.230 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: Do you know,
I've had somebody that's

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:52.690 align:middle line:10%
passed on actually start
connecting to me before they

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.440 align:middle line:10%
actually left their body?

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.900 align:middle line:90%
So they can connect--

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:29:58.745 --> 00:29:59.932 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --instantly.

00:29:59.932 --> 00:30:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you saw
J'amy's deceased mother,

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:90%
did you know it was her?

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.420 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: I did know it was her.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.700 align:middle line:90%
I just had this sense of--

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how I work is I'll know
If it's a mother figure, if it's

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.660 align:middle line:90%
on my left side.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But she also told me she
wanted to connect with her mom.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And so then I could feel her
personality coming through.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And she had this personality
that was very funny.

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:84%
I decided to take
a walk that day,

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:90%
and it was close to Halloween.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm taking
a walk, she goes,

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.480 align:middle line:84%
tell J'amy that us ghosts are
going to come out to play.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.638 align:middle line:90%
And it just made me laugh.

00:30:34.638 --> 00:30:35.555 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they did.

00:30:35.555 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: And you know what?

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.740 align:middle line:90%
She did have that personality.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.190 align:middle line:84%
She did have that
sense of humor.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
J'amy discussing the healing

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.700 align:middle line:10%
words of her mother
like you've mentioned,

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:10%
that she gives through you.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So your
mom comes through

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.180 align:middle line:90%
with something beautiful.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And then she wants to also
relieve you of this heaviness

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:56.860 align:middle line:90%
that you were holding.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.210 align:middle line:90%
She said it so gracefully.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, you don't have
to worry about me,

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.510 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing that
you nor I could have

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:05.015 align:middle line:90%
done to change this outcome.

00:31:05.015 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>J'AMY: I think
that was probably

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.900 align:middle line:84%
the most profound
sentence that was

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:84%
spoken during the
whole healing session.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I would say my whole life
up until that session,

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I believed that the
loss of a loved one

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:23.430 align:middle line:84%
created a pain that we as humans
just had to learn to live with,

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.480 align:middle line:84%
had to learn to
compartmentalize,

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.730 align:middle line:84%
move forward, push through it,
and feel it every now and then.

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And I now truly believe
that's not the case.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:35.630 align:middle line:84%
It is something that you
could get true healing from.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And that pain can be
transformed into joy.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.530 align:middle line:90%
And to hear her say that she--

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:45.120 align:middle line:84%
she had passed of an asthma
attack right in front of me.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Was quite traumatic.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I had just had my
son, who's 13 now.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And just to see her
right in front of you,

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.250 align:middle line:84%
just not being able
to breathe, it's

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:56.940 align:middle line:90%
a very traumatic thing to see.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it was very traumatic
for her to experience, too.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And to be given her
CPR and actually

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.410 align:middle line:84%
be the first responder until
the actual responders came,

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.320 align:middle line:84%
there was a huge part
of me that felt like,

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.090 align:middle line:90%
did I not do it right?

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Did I fail her?

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But if I had done
something differently,

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.980 align:middle line:84%
would the outcome
be any different?

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And I have lived with that
guilt for over 12 years

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and always wondering
like, what if?

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.360 align:middle line:90%
What if?

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And just to know that she
is in not any pain now

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:30.468 align:middle line:84%
and that she knew
that there was nothing

00:32:30.468 --> 00:32:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I could have done, that I
did everything I should have,

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and this was her time,
this was her exit point,

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:84%
as much as we both
didn't want it to be--

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.900 align:middle line:84%
this is how it was
supposed to happen.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.592 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't anything I
could have done differently

00:32:42.592 --> 00:32:43.800 align:middle line:90%
that would have changed that.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And that has given me so
much peace moving forward.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:49.730 align:middle line:90%
I was in a truly hypnotic state.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Like, I could see what
you were describing.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.320 align:middle line:84%
I could feel what
you're describing.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:84%
I could see my mom in it,
how you were describing.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was just--
it was interesting

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.380 align:middle line:84%
because I could see--
and you were narrating

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.450 align:middle line:90%
exactly what I was seeing.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.830 align:middle line:90%
And it was just incredible.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.350 align:middle line:90%
It was just this warm feeling.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain it.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.350 align:middle line:90%
It was just-- it was incredible.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And every single body part
that you had mentioned,

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I had felt little twitches
and twinges and not painful.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.240 align:middle line:84%
But I could actually
locate all of the things

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that you had talked about
when I listened to the tape.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
absolutely phenomenal.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.240 align:middle line:84%
He's blessed me with so
many different healings

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.190 align:middle line:90%
within this one session--

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.210 align:middle line:90%
mind, body, soul, spirit.

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he touched it all.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.610 align:middle line:90%
He touched it all.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.325 align:middle line:90%
And I see it every single day.

00:33:39.325 --> 00:33:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debra, how
does it make you feel

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:90%
to help other people like that?

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I cry.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:48.380 align:middle line:90%
I cry every time.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.215 align:middle line:90%
And I am filled with joy.

00:33:50.215 --> 00:33:51.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm filled with love.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But it impacts me because I
give all of myself to do this.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:10%
And then to have that
type of feedback,

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.340 align:middle line:10%
I know without a shadow of
a doubt, this is my mission.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just so beyond
blessed and grateful to be

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:05.785 align:middle line:90%
able to do this.

00:34:05.785 --> 00:34:06.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:34:06.745 --> 00:34:07.578 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Thank you.

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.925 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's very, very
important, what you do.

00:34:09.925 --> 00:34:11.659 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I feel that.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, when I go into a
session, I give 100% of myself

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:15.620 align:middle line:90%
beyond that.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have to remove
my humanness aside

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.429 align:middle line:84%
because it's coming
directly from God.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I cannot put my stuff
into these sessions.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.210 align:middle line:84%
I have to let go and
let God take over.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.929 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a group healing
class called Army for Love.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: OK, so Army
for Love is over Zoom.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.699 align:middle line:84%
And people all around
the world join.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:38.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a monthly-- once
a month, we meet.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And people like-minded or that
want to learn about spirituality

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:84%
or they might be dealing with
an illness or they just want

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.050 align:middle line:90%
to share--

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and we're here to
hold each other up,

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:51.530 align:middle line:84%
to hold one another
without judgment,

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and to just put
love into action.

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people are in a session?

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's not
really a session.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.677 align:middle line:90%
So it's unlimited.

00:35:01.677 --> 00:35:03.510 align:middle line:84%
People from all around
the world can gather.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.367 align:middle line:90%
But at the end of the hour--

00:35:05.367 --> 00:35:06.450 align:middle line:90%
it's usually an hour long.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.080 align:middle line:84%
At the of the session, I
do a mini-healing session

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.590 align:middle line:84%
for the group, and that
lasts about 15 minutes--

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For the masses?

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: For
everyone that's on.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.435 align:middle line:10%
Yes, it's like a group session,
but this is just a mini-healing.

00:35:18.435 --> 00:35:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But you never know what's
going to transpire.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:21.325 align:middle line:90%
And we've seen miracles.

00:35:21.325 --> 00:35:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
heal someone, Debra,

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.320 align:middle line:84%
who does not know
they're being worked on?

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.713 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, I can.

00:35:27.713 --> 00:35:28.880 align:middle line:90%
I think that's even really--

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:35:29.575 --> 00:35:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, and
think about it this way.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:10%
We say prayers for people.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.180 align:middle line:10%
So people like, is it unethical
to do a session for somebody

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.230 align:middle line:10%
that doesn't know?

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:41.180 align:middle line:10%
When you're doing
something out of love

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.187 align:middle line:10%
and you're asking for that
person to receive love,

00:35:44.187 --> 00:35:45.520 align:middle line:10%
there's nothing wrong with that.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.036 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is Giovanni?

00:35:47.036 --> 00:35:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Giovanni.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.120 align:middle line:90%
So Giovanni, I did not know.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.870 align:middle line:10%
He came to my Army for
Love for the first time.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.100 align:middle line:84%
He came because he
had a neck injury.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And he was a former
police officer.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:04.795 align:middle line:84%
And he had to quit
working due to the injury.

00:36:04.795 --> 00:36:05.600 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On the line of duty?

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --I didn't
know any of this.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.520 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that
he raised his hand

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.320 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the mini-healing.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.205 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I
received a miracle.

00:36:15.205 --> 00:36:16.418 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that?

00:36:16.418 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Just like that.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And all of us-- there
was over 60 people that

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.810 align:middle line:90%
witnessed it at that one time.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:22.775 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Within 15 minutes?

00:36:22.775 --> 00:36:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes,
within 15 minutes.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.130 align:middle line:90%
What happened to him?

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So what happened
is I was laying down.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.460 align:middle line:90%
We all close our eyes.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.550 align:middle line:90%
We put our hands out like this.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:37.310 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time I
saw spiritual surgeons come

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:90%
into Army for Love.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember
them going to the neck.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And I go, oh, somebody
has a neck issue.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And then my eyes
started moving rapidly.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.375 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew spiritual surgeons
were working on the neck.

00:36:55.375 --> 00:36:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they worked on
different areas of the body

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.580 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But when the session
was done and.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Giovanni raised
his hand to speak

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and said that it was him
that had the neck issue,

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:84%
he explained everything
that he went through.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.720 align:middle line:10%
But the testimonial that
I received from him,

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.600 align:middle line:10%
I waited a month to make sure
that his neck really was healed.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:10%
And so he came
back a month later

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.605 align:middle line:10%
and shared with us, the whole
group, what really transpired.

00:37:22.605 --> 00:37:23.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How's he doing today?

00:37:23.855 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Today, he
is doing amazing.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he says you
are his number one man.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:30.380 align:middle line:90%
He loves your show.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, I love that.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.675 align:middle line:90%
One day, get him on.

00:37:33.675 --> 00:37:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah,
he said thank you.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a video
of Giovanni talking

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.520 align:middle line:90%
about this miraculous healing.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.376 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:37:42.376 --> 00:37:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>&GTGIOVANNI: I was a
federal police officer.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I worked at the VA hospital
and had got injured in 2017,

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.160 align:middle line:90%
injured my C6, C7.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Decided not to do surgery.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.305 align:middle line:90%
I tried everything else.

00:37:57.305 --> 00:38:00.310 align:middle line:90%


00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And for some-- and
so long story short,

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I retired in 2020 as a
federal police officer,

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's just been
me on my own trying

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:17.680 align:middle line:84%
to make sense of this
pain and why I'm in it.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But I just-- something
just kept telling me,

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.270 align:middle line:90%
don't do the surgery.

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.070 align:middle line:90%
You're too young.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Don't do the surgery.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.920 align:middle line:90%
So I can't do the surgery.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And now I found
you through Gaia.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.452 align:middle line:90%
I was sleeping one day.

00:38:31.452 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Woke up in the
middle of the night.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Gaia was on, and you were
speaking about healing sessions.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.720 align:middle line:90%
I heard Army for Love.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.970 align:middle line:90%
And I was in the Marine Corps.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, well,
piqued my interest.

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.390 align:middle line:90%
So on November 7, I decided.

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, you know what?

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.110 align:middle line:84%
I'd walk my dog previously
to getting on the call

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and I gave in to my pain
somehow, where I just said,

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.830 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:02.450 align:middle line:84%
If this is my last resort,
this doesn't work out,

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:04.970 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to force
myself to do the surgery,

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:07.070 align:middle line:90%
even though I know that this--

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:09.680 align:middle line:90%
I was so against having surgery.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.150 align:middle line:90%
So I got on the call.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And during the healing session,
I completely let myself go.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:90%
I went into it not--

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I was hoping to get something,
nothing like what I received.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, I let
go of all of my expectations

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.280 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.817 align:middle line:90%
I just completely let myself go.

00:39:31.817 --> 00:39:32.900 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know what?

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Let me fully
experience everything

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.860 align:middle line:90%
that I can do for myself.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.000 align:middle line:90%
And I just let go.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I focused on breath.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And then next you know,
I can feel everything

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.640 align:middle line:90%
that you were saying.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.920 align:middle line:90%
It was weird.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I can feel the legs
tingling, my leg tingling.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.900 align:middle line:90%
I can feel pain on my side.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And then my eyes went up
to my third eye region.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And I started-- my eyes started
flickering back and forth.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you're like, oh,
I can feel my eyes fluttering.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.400 align:middle line:90%
And I was conscious of it.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I think
she's talking about me.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.040 align:middle line:84%
But something inside
is like, just let go.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.030 align:middle line:90%
So I let go.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And I saw-- and I'm
getting emotional,

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:18.133 align:middle line:84%
but there were emergency
room doors open

00:40:18.133 --> 00:40:19.050 align:middle line:90%
and said waiting room.

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:20.657 align:middle line:90%
But it was-- the door opened.

00:40:20.657 --> 00:40:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And right at that point,
you're like, oh, we

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:23.980 align:middle line:90%
have a surgeon here.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:31.651 align:middle line:90%


00:40:31.651 --> 00:40:34.505 align:middle line:90%
I felt peace.

00:40:34.505 --> 00:40:39.880 align:middle line:90%


00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.680 align:middle line:90%
I felt pain.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.250 align:middle line:90%


00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:44.800 align:middle line:90%
I was becoming friends with it.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.440 align:middle line:84%
It was a weird
feeling at that point.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But then this cold
sensation hit my neck.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, oh,
I can feel the neck.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And then it felt like if you
were to heat up honey and put it

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.850 align:middle line:84%
on the neck, it was this
substance that I could feel.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:03.700 align:middle line:90%


00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you're like,
well, some of you

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.940 align:middle line:84%
might be experiencing
the anesthesia,

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.360 align:middle line:90%
and I could feel the numbness.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And I just had this
knowing that at that point,

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.210 align:middle line:90%
I was already healed.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:24.980 align:middle line:90%
And at that moment, I just knew.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't put it to words.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:29.960 align:middle line:90%


00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:37.510 align:middle line:84%
But other than experiencing
the births of my children,

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:42.380 align:middle line:84%
marrying my wife, and
becoming a friend to myself,

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:47.000 align:middle line:84%
this was one of the most
profound experiences in my life.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.230 align:middle line:90%
I have no pain.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't have gotten
that without you, Debra.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:57.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, thank you.

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How thankful
he is, isn't he?

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:01.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's dramatic.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like nothing
ever happened to him.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Right, it
just was instant.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.580 align:middle line:84%
It was beautiful for
us all to witness,

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.410 align:middle line:84%
that all things are
possible at any moment--

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:11.300 align:middle line:90%
any moment.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was speechless,
even listening to it

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:15.650 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was amazing.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:16.780 align:middle line:90%
He was emotional.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: He was very emotional.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.157 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are, too.

00:42:19.157 --> 00:42:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah,
every single time

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and with every single
healing I do, I am emotional.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:29.460 align:middle line:84%
What I loved about what he did
is he went with no expectations.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.663 align:middle line:90%
He removed his expectations.

00:42:31.663 --> 00:42:33.913 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we go into something,
we have expectations--

00:42:33.913 --> 00:42:35.038 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Expecting nothing.

00:42:35.038 --> 00:42:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, we put
limitations on things

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:39.210 align:middle line:90%
when we have expectations.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Just let everything go.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Let God take over.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he did.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Debra, what about
other people during the Army

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.420 align:middle line:90%
of Love groupings?

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.435 align:middle line:10%
What happened to them?

00:42:49.435 --> 00:42:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So this
is so phenomenal.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So in that one session,
there was another lady

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:58.050 align:middle line:90%
that had a neck injury.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And she remembers me saying to
the group, when one is healed,

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.130 align:middle line:90%
we are all healed.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:07.760 align:middle line:10%
So later that night,
she's like, well, I

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.690 align:middle line:10%
remember Debra saying, when one
is healed, they are all healed.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:12.577 align:middle line:10%
So she's like, wait a minute.

00:43:12.577 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:84%
She started moving
her neck like this.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, oh my gosh,
I have full range of motion.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:18.240 align:middle line:90%
My neck is healed, too.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.573 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she never had that.

00:43:19.573 --> 00:43:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, she
didn't have that at all.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And so she emailed
me that next morning

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and told me that she
too had neck injuries.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And she too was
healed at that moment.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Other people had-- there
were two other people

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.900 align:middle line:84%
on that call that had
intestinal issues that they

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.440 align:middle line:90%
went into the intestines.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Both of those women
spoke up that they felt--

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:45.110 align:middle line:84%
it's just phenomenal to see
the different parts of my body

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:45.955 align:middle line:90%
that I'm feeling.

00:43:45.955 --> 00:43:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And then people
get on the screen

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:48.805 align:middle line:90%
and validate it right after.

00:43:48.805 --> 00:43:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people
book you for a session?

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.450 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: They can
go to my website

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:56.590 align:middle line:10%
directly at goldenmiracles.com.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.338 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And can they
email you as well?

00:43:58.338 --> 00:44:00.630 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, right,
everything's through my website.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have all
my social media there.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I would love people
to join that as well.

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long are you
going to continue doing this,

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.330 align:middle line:90%
to help people.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Debra?

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I feel
like this is my--

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Calling?

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --calling for my
lifetime, my whole life, yeah.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're one of a kind.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:16.193 align:middle line:90%
You know that?

00:44:16.193 --> 00:44:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
thank you, George.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I feel pretty special,
but I feel very blessed

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:21.860 align:middle line:90%
to do the work.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Keep in
touch with Giovanni.

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Oh, yes,
in fact, I'm actually

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:28.500 align:middle line:84%
going to be traveling
down to Miami,

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to meet in person.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've not met him yet?

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I haven't
met him in person.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.570 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to hug him.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's going
to break down and cry.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.265 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:44:36.265 --> 00:44:37.432 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: [LAUGHS] He might.

00:44:37.432 --> 00:44:38.323 align:middle line:90%
I probably will, too.

00:44:38.323 --> 00:44:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debra, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Thank
you for having me.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
soul, helping others,

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:47.360 align:middle line:84%
healing emotionally
and physically.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.110 align:middle line:90%
You've witnessed a few.

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's probably
many, many more.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
