00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.810 align:middle line:84%
We've got an amazing
program for you today.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:10%
Michelle Clare is with
us, a certified medium,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.640 align:middle line:10%
angel intuitive, and three-time
near-death experience survivor.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:84%
She receives messages from
loved ones who have crossed over

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:84%
as well as angels
and life guides.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Michelle, I'm glad
you're here in the flesh.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE CLARE: Well,
thank you, George.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy to be
here in the flesh.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Three
near-death experiences?

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.825 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Absolutely.

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:44.348 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to you?

00:00:44.348 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Oh, my goodness.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.723 align:middle line:10%
Well, you would have thought
one would have been enough.

00:00:47.723 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:10%
But the first one happened
to me in April of 2000.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:10%
I was in a hospital visiting
my sister-in-law who

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:10%
was having her baby, and
I was talking to her RN

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:10%
in the hallway who was my
friend from high school.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:10%
I had a massive seizure.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And I remember opening my
eyes laying with my head

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:84%
in my grandma's lap, who had
passed away a couple of years

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:90%
previously to that.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
the second one?

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The second one
was when I had my son.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I had multiple complications
after I had him.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:84%
They decided to go in and
have a D&C surgery done,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.760 align:middle line:84%
which was going to be a
45-minute outpatient procedure.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they ruptured my
uterus in multiple locations.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And the third one,
what happened then?

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: And the third
one, I was up on a ladder

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.260 align:middle line:90%
about 12 feet off the ground.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And the ladder
shifted and I fell.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
I hit the back of my head on the
corner of the granite island.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And I had a 5 and 1/2-inch skull
fracture and a traumatic brain

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.510 align:middle line:90%
injury.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you had
these three episodes.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back to the
first one, the seizure.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Were you fine prior to that?

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: I was fine.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:84%
I've never had a
seizure before or since.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I was literally standing in the
hallway, everything was good.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:90%
I had this massive seizure.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I
know, I'm in this room.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:90%
And the walls are all white.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
They are alive.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:90%
They are breathing.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.120 align:middle line:84%
They are radiating light and
love and it is a timeless space.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And I notice that I'm laying
with my head in my grandma's

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:90%
lap.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And she is the youngest,
healthiest version of herself

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:90%
that I can remember.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And then as I'm looking at
her, I look up next to her

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.298 align:middle line:84%
and I see a beautiful angel
that is about 12 feet tall.

00:02:29.298 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Saying, go back.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Go back.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: I was drawn
into her energy

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:90%
because she was just radiant.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to look at her,
I was looking for feather wings.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And what I noticed were
wings made of light.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.228 align:middle line:90%
They're really not birdlike--

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: No.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --as the artist depict.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
your guardian angel?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: This was
my guardian angel.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I asked her in my head, I
said, what is your name?

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And she answered me.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:84%
She said, "My name is Madeline,
and I'm your guardian angel."

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't aware of
telepathic communication

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
at that point in
time, but I quickly

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
was surprised that she
heard what I was thinking.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
being in this room

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:84%
with unconditional love,
timelessness, bliss,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.840 align:middle line:84%
feeling the most loved I
had ever felt in my life.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had grown
up feeling loved,

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.920 align:middle line:84%
but it was a different
level of love.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:84%
It was this
unconditional love that's

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.855 align:middle line:90%
truly available to all of us.

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:32.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you think
the angels visit us?

00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: I believe
that they visit us

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.600 align:middle line:84%
because they want us to
know that they're real

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and we're not living
this life alone,

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:84%
that we really have guidance
and support from the other side.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there unconditional
love between the angel

00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:45.895 align:middle line:90%
and the human?

00:03:45.895 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Absolutely.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they want?

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.700 align:middle line:84%
What does the angel
want out of this?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: What the angel gets
out of this is an energetically

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:84%
vibrational high,
if you would say,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.120 align:middle line:84%
that they get to
assist us in our life

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and they get to be there to help
us, protect us, and guide us.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And also for them,
they get to learn

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
through our human
experience too.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So they're learning and they're
enjoying this energetic exchange

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:90%
that we're having with them.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is science
the Guardian Angels to us?

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Our soul picks
our guardian angel

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:84%
before we incarnate
into planet Earth.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
a God type thing?

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: I believe it could
be, but very often, we're

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:84%
talking about
vibrational matches.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So we want to connect with
angels that resonate with us.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everybody
have a guardian angel?

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Everybody
has at least one.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At least one.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: At least.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.163 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean we have
sometimes more than one?

00:04:39.163 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Absolutely.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's not uncommon
to have angels

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that specialize when you're
working on something, step

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
onto your team to
help you for a while.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody's
starting a new business,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:84%
we might have an angel that
specializes with that, show up

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:90%
to join your team for a while.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you generally
only know your guardian angel

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:90%
in a near-death experience?

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: No.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I find that people are becoming
much more open to connecting

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:90%
with their angels.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they are
asking for signs.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:84%
They're asking for
feelings, smells,

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:84%
different things that
will let them know

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.945 align:middle line:90%
when their angel is around.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
communicate with an angel?

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Very telepathically,
so in your mind.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking to them,
we can speak out loud.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.215 align:middle line:90%
They'll hear us either way.

00:05:21.215 --> 00:05:23.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you go into
some kind of meditation?

00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Meditation is great
for connecting with your angels,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.965 align:middle line:90%
That's how I started.

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now,
what's a soul group?

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: A soul group
is a group of souls

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:84%
that have decided to
come to planet Earth

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.405 align:middle line:84%
to learn and play,
grow, evolve together.

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.245 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
is a pre-life plan?

00:05:40.245 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: A pre-life
plan would be

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:84%
what your soul is creating
before you show up

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So you say, hey, I'm
going to go to Earth.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.085 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to learn
these lessons.

00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
these experiences.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we decide who we want
to be the players on our team

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.455 align:middle line:90%
and we come in for that.

00:05:54.455 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do a lot of
group sessions, don't you?

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: I do.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We happen
to have on tape.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: OK.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So for you I have either a
father figure stepping through

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.645 align:middle line:84%
or the grandfather
on the father's side.

00:06:07.645 --> 00:06:10.182 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand this?

00:06:10.182 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Has your dad already passed
though, because it feels more--

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.855 align:middle line:90%
OK, it feels more fatherly.

00:06:13.855 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you, I feel such
an outpouring of love for you.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So from your dad,
he wants to talk

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
about there's been a
life shift for you it

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:90%
feels like within the last--

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:90%
not that long ago.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:90%
Last couple of years possibly.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:90%
So he's acknowledging that.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:90%
But I'm feeling a calm.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if this shift
helped make your life calm

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.887 align:middle line:84%
or if this is the calm that's
now coming because you've

00:06:53.887 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:90%
gotten through this shift.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's at a different
level now, OK?

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So there is a level of peace
that there wasn't before.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.790 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's also really
important for you

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:84%
to know how much
your dad appreciated

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:84%
the man you were
because I do feel like--

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and I know it's natural to butt
heads at times with our parents

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:90%
because that's just life.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.990 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to know
that from his perspective,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.570 align:middle line:84%
at times, he just wanted to
stand the ground because he

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:84%
was dad and it was
his way and he's dad.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:90%
And so it's no, right?

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And I can feel
that, but I want you

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to know that he really
appreciates you for who you are

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.625 align:middle line:84%
and for the choices
that you have made.

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling me
he's probably not

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.270 align:middle line:90%
believing you right now.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Just so you know, I hear
him telling me like,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
he's not believing
you right now.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.935 align:middle line:84%
At least he's being
honest, right?

00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:02.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.195 align:middle line:84%
You need to know that your
dad does care enough to come

00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:05.995 align:middle line:90%
through tonight.

00:08:05.995 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:84%
That was his main message
that he does care enough

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:90%
to come through tonight.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:84%
The road to peace is
important for you.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.955 align:middle line:90%
And he wants you to find that.

00:08:21.955 --> 00:08:24.570 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And he's making me feel like
he was a very short sighted,

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.893 align:middle line:84%
so maybe this is like
instant gratification like,

00:08:29.893 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%
well, I want this now,
so I'm going to do this

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and not looking long
term down the road

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.539 align:middle line:84%
into just the way this
might all play out.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:90%
But I feel this from him.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:90%
And I feel about apology.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:90%
I feel it for you.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:90%
I feel it for your mom.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.565 align:middle line:90%
I feel it for your brother.

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean that your family didn't
have the level of peace in it

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.560 align:middle line:90%
that it could have.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, yeah.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.516 align:middle line:84%
And he's taking full
responsibility for that.

00:08:56.516 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get emotional
with these sessions?

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: At times, I do.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I try to stay a clear
channel for spirit,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:84%
so I try to leave my emotions
out of it and step aside.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But there are moments when
I'm reading, especially

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:84%
for parents who have had
kids that have transitioned,

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
where as a mom, it's hard
to not deeply feel that.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What drew him to you
in the first place, that client?

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.640 align:middle line:90%
That client, he was curious.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.560 align:middle line:90%
He was curious.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Who's out there?

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Do they want to talk to me?

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.735 align:middle line:84%
Him and his dad had had a
challenging relationship.

00:09:27.735 --> 00:09:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: And so a lot of times
when I'm doing a reading,

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:84%
it's the person that we've
had a challenging relationship

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
will come in to apologize,
give clarity, and help

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
you realize why they
were a part of your life.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they're always looking
for that peace, I feel.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michelle, do
you talk to the dead?

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.358 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: I talk to
the alive in spirit.

00:09:47.358 --> 00:09:48.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that work?

00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: That works with
me going into somewhat

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:90%
of a meditative state.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Usually--

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost like a trance?

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Well, a little bit.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I look very much like
you just saw in that clip

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:90%
where I'm talking--

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were pretty
wide awake in that clip.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:84%
My brainwaves will go
to theta or delta state.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So I've been studied
while I do this.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And in that state,
I look wide awake.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm able to really connect
with the loved ones and spirit

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.655 align:middle line:90%
and angels and life guides.

00:10:15.655 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does
this happen to you?

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: I think
it has a lot to do

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:84%
with my near-death experiences
because with each one,

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:90%
this ability grew stronger.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And I almost feel like I
came back as an ambassador,

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:84%
if you would say, to remind
people that we're not

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:90%
living this life alone.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
We are surrounded and supported
with loved ones in spirit,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400 align:middle line:90%
life guides, and angels.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had to
live it all over again--

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get into a near-death
experience number two

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:90%
in a second--

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.316 align:middle line:84%
would you prefer to have not
had any of this happen to you?

00:10:48.316 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Well, it
seems like it would

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:84%
be easier if I could
have done it that way.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:84%
But I would tell you with
the growth and the depth

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and the things that
have come into my life

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.100 align:middle line:84%
since I've been able
to connect this way,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say
I wouldn't change it.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.735 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would have
lost out on all that.

00:11:04.735 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: I would have missed
out on a huge part of my life

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and the meaning of love and the
meaning of life and the fact

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.495 align:middle line:84%
that we're here to
experience both.

00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think you
would have found that just

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:90%
merely living your life?

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: I don't think
it would have been

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.280 align:middle line:90%
as vibrant as it is for me now.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Near death number two again.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Tell us again what that was.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So that one happened
in May of 2006.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was going in for a D&C,
which is just a procedure

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.810 align:middle line:90%
to clear out your uterus.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I had had a lot of complications
after I had had my son.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So they said, we'll just
do this quick procedure.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:90%
45 minutes, you'll be fine.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:84%
The night before, I
had a pit in my stomach

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and I felt like I
shouldn't do it.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to believe it
would be easy and over quickly

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:90%
so I went in.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.450 align:middle line:90%
And I had had anesthesia before.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
When I've had it,
I remember it just

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:90%
being a blank space, nothing.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:90%
No dreams, nothing.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
But at this day, I
counted backwards

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:90%
for the anesthesiologist.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I remember
is my beautiful white German

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.020 align:middle line:84%
shepherd who had passed
a couple of years

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.680 align:middle line:84%
prior came walking into
the operating room, laid

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.760 align:middle line:90%
her head on my gurney.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I
knew, we were gone.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: And we were on
the most amazing beach.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Every drop of water, every
flower, every piece of sand

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:84%
was radiating this
light and love that

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.400 align:middle line:90%
was coming from the inside out.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:84%
There were colors that
I had never seen before

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't seen them again,
smells, sounds, emotions.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:84%
It was literally
this heavenly realm.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You saw Jesus.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: I did.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that happen?

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Tell us tell us that episode.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: So as I
was moving through

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.980 align:middle line:84%
this near-death experience,
I was on the beach

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:90%
running with my dog.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:90%
And I felt my son called me.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:84%
He was six weeks old at the
time and at home with my mom.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And he was afraid
because he knew

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:90%
I was getting ready to leave.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So I remember going to
him, and I remember saying,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.770 align:middle line:90%
I will find a way to stay.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I
knew, I started praying.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And I just started
saying, "It's not my time.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Please help me.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:90%
My kids still need me."

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, I was
back in the operating room.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Jesus came in as my peer with
this beautiful white, golden

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:84%
light, this energy of a best
friend, unconditional love.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know,
I was waking up in post-op

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and my 45 minute procedure had
turned into a 3 and 1/2 hour

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:90%
emergency surgery.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:40.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:13:40.765 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:90%
They were scared, weren't they?

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Mm-hmm.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What determines
whether you come back or not?

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.010 align:middle line:90%
And who determines that?

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Right.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So in this second
near-death experience,

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there are at
least three levels to which that

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
One, can the body maintain
life or is it too traumatized?

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.970 align:middle line:84%
The second one is about our
soul and our soul's plan.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So is this a soul
plan or a timeline

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be
continued and carried out?

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Or if this person
decides to leave,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.710 align:middle line:84%
can we have someone else, let's
say, step in to raise my kids?

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And then that third
level really comes down

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.216 align:middle line:90%
to the soul and the divine.

00:14:19.216 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever, at any
of these episodes, want to stay?

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I was never in any
hurry to get back.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.904 align:middle line:90%
I was always enjoying--

00:14:30.904 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:90%
enjoying is an understatement.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:84%
It is such a
blissful place to be.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:84%
There is no part of you
that really is wanting

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.285 align:middle line:90%
to come back to the human race.

00:14:39.285 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you learned,
Michelle, about your soul

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:90%
through all this?

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've learned
one thing for sure.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Our souls are capable
of ushering in miracles.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And what happened in that
second near-death experience was

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:90%
my soul was doing that.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.295 align:middle line:84%
I asked for help, I asked for
guidance and it was there.

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that I've learned

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:02.510 align:middle line:84%
is that my soul kind of came
to find God in multiple ways,

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.040 align:middle line:84%
not just in a religion, but in
these near-death experiences

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.230 align:middle line:84%
during my existence
here on Earth.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the purpose
of a near-death experience?

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: For me,
it was awakenings.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like for
many people who've

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:19.250 align:middle line:84%
had near-death experiences, it's
for them to awaken and to share

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:84%
the message for all of us that
we are supported and loved

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and that none of us
are accidentally here.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.176 align:middle line:90%
We are all here with purposes.

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you're a
Christian, so you see Jesus.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Mm-hmm.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
you're a Buddhist?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Then I believe
you would see Buddha.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:84%
From my understanding
of spirit world,

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that heavenly realm
always greets us

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.490 align:middle line:84%
with unconditional love and
what keeps us comfortable.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:47.045 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to find what
you're expecting to see.

00:15:47.045 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's truly remarkable.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you come back,
are you in pain, physical pain?

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.670 align:middle line:84%
After every
near-death experience,

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I came back with quite
a bit of physical trauma

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.135 align:middle line:84%
that would take me
months to work through.

00:16:02.135 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Months?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Months.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.180 align:middle line:84%
With this one, with this
surgery that went wrong,

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:84%
it took me four
months to get back

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:14.175 align:middle line:84%
to 80% of my physical
normal health.

00:16:14.175 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:20.160 align:middle line:84%
We've got a clip of you with a
client discussing spirit guides.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.805 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a watch.

00:16:21.805 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Anything
about my spirit guides

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.595 align:middle line:84%
so I can start being more
intentional in working

00:16:26.595 --> 00:16:27.395 align:middle line:90%
with them?

00:16:27.395 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Mm-hmm.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.733 align:middle line:84%
Well, I actually
feel like you already

00:16:31.733 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:90%
work very closely with them.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I try.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:90%
I try.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.808 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: They're
actually already telling

00:16:36.808 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:90%
me you do a good job.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: No.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that whatever channels
or frequencies or however

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.340 align:middle line:84%
you're already doing
that, keep that amplified

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:90%
and keep it going.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And then always ask for more.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Just say, more
signs, more awareness.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're thinking
of it as a channel,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.645 align:middle line:84%
ask for a bigger channel,
a more clear channel.

00:16:54.645 --> 00:16:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.258 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Ask for more.

00:16:58.258 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to tell you.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Because they're
already telling me

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.508 align:middle line:84%
that you're hearing
them and you're

00:17:02.508 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:84%
knowing what they're saying
and the information is

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:05.819 align:middle line:90%
coming through clearly.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So they're not giving me the
information of like, hey, we

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.260 align:middle line:90%
got to wake her up.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I feel at all.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.829 align:middle line:84%
It feels like you're
there with them.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:16.124 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:16.124 --> 00:17:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.695 align:middle line:84%
And one of them has a very
strong Egyptian connection.

00:17:19.695 --> 00:17:21.195 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, is
that interesting.

00:17:21.195 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Female energy that
I feel with a very strong

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Egyptian connection.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: So it'll be fun to
see what she does for you.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
no kidding, right?

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I feel like sometimes I
dream about the pyramids,

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:41.138 align:middle line:84%
and I can hear these frequencies
in the dreams about--

00:17:41.138 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what they're about.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.950 align:middle line:84%
But it just there's these
really specific tones.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:84%
That's what they were telling
me, tones was the word they use.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: They use that.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:90%
They use sound.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.808 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'll even wake up
to the sound sometimes.

00:17:50.808 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:84%
They're giving me
the word harmonizing.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So these tones are harmonizing
your energy or your frequency

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.250 align:middle line:90%
or your vibration.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
happening actively

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:84%
in this life from what
you're experiencing.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, cool.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: So it's not--
they want me to be clear.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:90%
It could be a past life memory.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.660 align:middle line:90%
It may be.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.251 align:middle line:84%
But it is also
actively happening now.

00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michelle, in your
near-death experience,

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
do you come across
your Akashic Records?

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: You can.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I did not in mine, but if we
stay longer on the other side,

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.120 align:middle line:90%
we are able to see those.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who unfolds it for us?

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Is it done like a
trial proceedings?

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.610 align:middle line:84%
No, I believe it's done
by our spirit team,

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.460 align:middle line:84%
so our life guides and our
angels and our loved ones

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:84%
as they're wanting us
to understand and really

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:84%
connect with more of
ourselves as a whole.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pretty
dramatic, isn't it?

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of all this

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:90%
personally at this point?

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Is it a learning experience?

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: It is a
learning experience.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful
evolution of a soul's growth

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.150 align:middle line:84%
when we learn that our
loved ones are still here

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:90%
and that we are divinely guided.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:90%
None of us are here by accident.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
All of our souls
chose to come here.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It really is a
learning experience

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:84%
that empowers you to
create the life that you're

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
wanting to live and to find the
people that resonate with you.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have heard
from other experts

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that the heavenly realm has
different levels and stages.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.935 align:middle line:90%
Would you agree with that?

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: I would
agree with that.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, what
I find, depending

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.800 align:middle line:84%
on the soul when
they transition,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:84%
some people are ready to
just barely step into heaven

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.380 align:middle line:84%
to find that beach
or the mountains

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they're
expecting, to see grandma.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And then other people have
lived so many lifetimes

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:84%
that they're really
ready to go further

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.895 align:middle line:84%
into the depth of what we can
find in that heavenly realm.

00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is planet
Earth to the scheme of things?

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Does it matter where we are?

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes, it matters a lot.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
We are on the cutting edge
of learning and growing here.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a classroom
unlike anywhere else.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Souls are literally
lined up to come here

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.540 align:middle line:84%
because we're taking
the advanced course,

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:84%
if you would call it that, the
advanced course in life where

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:84%
our souls experience
more with the contrast

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:84%
here than we do in
any other realm.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.948 align:middle line:84%
But that contrast
allows us to grow.

00:20:24.948 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it take the
three near-death experiences--

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get into number
three in a second--

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:90%
for you to get to this point?

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: It did.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.660 align:middle line:90%
I did it the hard way.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:10%
I feel like each one was a
wake up call and an opening

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:10%
for me to express more
of who I truly was.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:90%
But it did.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:90%
It took each one.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do angels
have souls, Michelle?

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.115 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: They do.

00:20:47.115 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do we know this?

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Because they exist in
that divine space that all of us

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.700 align:middle line:90%
also exist in.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're all a piece
of light from the whole,

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:84%
from the divine source,
God, whatever word

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:90%
we want to use for that.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So we all are existing with
our own spark of light.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your third death
experience happened when?

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: On 11/1/11,
so November 1, 2011.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Those are angel
numbers right there.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.470 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: They are?

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I have 14-foot
ceilings in my house.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was about 12 feet off
the ground on a ladder changing

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:90%
batteries in a candle.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And as I got to the
top, I felt the ladder

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.690 align:middle line:90%
start to shift below me.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, no.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Literally, the
only thing I could think

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.060 align:middle line:90%
is, this is going to hurt.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I knew,
I was ripped out of my body,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
not in a painful way,
but in a very fast way

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:90%
like a bungee cord.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I was turned around
facing my body

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and the ladder
suspended in the air.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing with these
three people that I didn't know,

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but they felt like really
close family or friends.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.380 align:middle line:84%
There was an Asian
man, an Egyptian woman,

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.830 align:middle line:90%
and a Hawaiian man.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And as I stood
there with them, I

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:84%
was in that beautiful
timeless space,

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.510 align:middle line:90%
that unconditioned love again.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And I could see my body
suspended in the air.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.410 align:middle line:84%
They said to me, what
do you want to do?

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to stay
or do you want to go?

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you said?

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: I actually
didn't answer right away.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.712 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to understand
how I had forever to decide.

00:22:20.712 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
to think about it?

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: I did.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking
about it because I

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.640 align:middle line:84%
was torn with this
beautiful love

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.070 align:middle line:84%
that I felt within
me and all around me

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.580 align:middle line:90%
from this heavenly realm.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I could see
my younger two kids.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And as I saw my kids,
I saw a beautiful angel

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.060 align:middle line:84%
come in, a different one than in
my first near-death experience.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:84%
This one was dressed
in red and gold.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw
this angel, I knew

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:84%
that it was there to either
take me home or shift something

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:90%
so that I could stay.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And as I saw my
younger two kids,

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:84%
I made the decision
I need to stay.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, as Robert
Frost writes in his poems,

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:84%
"You have miles to go before
you sleep," basically.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Absolutely.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment when
I made that decision,

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I was downloaded with
a lot of information.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I was told I needed to come back
and do my mediumship the way

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:90%
that I had planned originally.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I was told that my long
marriage was probably not going

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:84%
to survive my mediumship and
would probably end in divorce

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and that there would
be more trauma,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
but that there would be so
much joy and so many lives.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.172 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did that happen?

00:23:22.172 --> 00:23:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: It did happen.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting prediction.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.630 align:middle line:84%
The movie "It's a Wonderful
Life," you've seen it--

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --with Jimmy Stewart.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Clarence comes back to save him.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Basically, he was his guide, his
guardian angel, his life guide.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.255 align:middle line:90%
Is that real?

00:23:38.255 --> 00:23:39.055 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:23:39.055 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: It can happen.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a life guide?

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: So a life
guide for me is somebody

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:84%
or a soul that has been
human many, many times

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and has really mastered
so many of the lessons

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:90%
here on planet Earth.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And so they step in to help
guide and direct souls that

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:84%
are not as mature as them as
we're here on this planet.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a clip
discussing spirit guides.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: And so I do want
to start first off with--

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I want to say it's a grandfather
figure because dad is still

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.265 align:middle line:90%
here, correct?

00:24:09.265 --> 00:24:09.775 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:24:09.775 --> 00:24:10.575 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: OK.

00:24:10.575 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like I'm supposed
to tell you happy birthday.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So either your birthday is
coming up right around now,

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.520 align:middle line:84%
but that's kind of the energy
that I want to give you.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Happy birthday, son.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.095 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE:
Halloween, October 31.

00:24:22.095 --> 00:24:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: OK.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So he's just acknowledging
that that's coming up for you.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:84%
He's also showing me to some
of the landscape in your life.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:90%
Things are starting to shift.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going to be
having more awakenings as you're

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.910 align:middle line:90%
moving through this thing.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.620 align:middle line:84%
He's also wanting
me to say things

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:84%
that used to work for you are
not going to work anymore.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to find
yourself letting go of--

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.570 align:middle line:84%
he's wanting me to
use the words comfort.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Things that used to
be comfortable now

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.642 align:middle line:90%
just don't do it anymore.

00:24:49.642 --> 00:24:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're probably
already feeling

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that along with the
energy that he's giving

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.090 align:middle line:90%
me is some restlessness.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, definitely.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: And he's
telling me to tell you

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.995 align:middle line:84%
that you're very anxious to
get to this next step of you.

00:25:03.995 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah, you are.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Like you're ready.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Like I feel like you're just
ready to rip out of this energy

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.920 align:middle line:84%
that you're in and step
into the next version.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:90%
But you're really close.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
there, he's telling me,

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.430 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to take a
little bit more time or more

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:90%
inner work.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, I agree.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.310 align:middle line:84%
He's also showing me a
lot of coins for you.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So you should be finding
pennies, nickels, dimes,

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.360 align:middle line:90%
quarters.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Those are going to
be coming from him.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's weird.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream last night
that I found a penny

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:84%
that I had never
seen before, like it

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.210 align:middle line:90%
had different design on it.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of crazy.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.240 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So he's leaving them
for you in your dreams.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just remembered
that right now too.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:45.755 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's crazy.

00:25:45.755 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Your dreams
are, what he's

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:84%
telling me, like portals
or visions for you, right?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And you are often
finding yourself

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:84%
in your dream are the
words that he's giving me.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So even if it doesn't
look like you or something

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:04.242 align:middle line:84%
that you relate to, it's a
part of you, an aspect of you,

00:26:04.242 --> 00:26:06.100 align:middle line:84%
a version of you
that you're finding.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So this new penny or whatever
this is that you found,

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:84%
that's to me, also
symbolizes what

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.040 align:middle line:84%
he's talking about finding
this new version of yourself.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do so many spirits
deal with change, loose change?

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.910 align:middle line:90%
It happens in the movie "Ghost."

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Remember that penny
that went up the wall?

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.245 align:middle line:90%
Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore.

00:26:24.245 --> 00:26:25.045 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes.

00:26:25.045 --> 00:26:26.003 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the one--

00:26:26.003 --> 00:26:28.183 align:middle line:84%
Why did they deal
with change like that?

00:26:28.183 --> 00:26:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Because it's
obvious that's something

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.060 align:middle line:90%
that we can see.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's easy for
spirit to kind manipulate,

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:84%
so it's easy for
them to manifest

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:84%
a penny on the ground or a
quarter or whatever this is.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And so very often too, people
whenever these signs come up

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.540 align:middle line:84%
will say, well, my dad
always had a jar of change

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
or my grandpa always made
me roll his quarters.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So usually, when
the spirit is also

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:84%
giving me the change
as a sign, it's

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.155 align:middle line:84%
something that person is
connected with in life.

00:26:56.155 --> 00:26:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
have a past loved

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.325 align:middle line:90%
one who communicates with you?

00:26:59.325 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: I do.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I have multiple loved
ones on the other side.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:84%
My mom is one of my
strongest supporters.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And very often, she
will come in and just

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.897 align:middle line:84%
give me messages
of hope, really,

00:27:11.897 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:90%
is the word I want to say.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Keep going.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:90%
You've got this next step.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But being able to
feel our loved ones

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and to know how much they
are wanting us to succeed

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:84%
is really important
in our growth.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they come
to you in dream states?

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Once in a while.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Most of my--

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a lot.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Not too often.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Most of my mediumship
is done while I'm awake.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what's an
exit point, Michelle?

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: An exit point
would be something

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:84%
that our soul plans before we
come to Earth as opportunities

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:84%
for us to leave and go
back to the heavenly realm.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And normally, a soul will
put in between three to five

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.750 align:middle line:90%
exit points in their life plan.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's
the car crash myth,

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.330 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it's the car
accident that you did have

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:54.950 align:middle line:90%
but you walked away from.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.020 align:middle line:84%
We have multiple
points where we will

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.383 align:middle line:90%
choose to either stay or go.

00:27:58.383 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you speak
to people who have

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.496 align:middle line:90%
had near-death experiences?

00:28:01.496 --> 00:28:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: I do.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they all
have similar traits

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.260 align:middle line:90%
after they've come back?

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.410 align:middle line:84%
One thing that we
know is most people

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:84%
that have near-death
experiences come back

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.290 align:middle line:84%
with a heightened increase
in mediumship or spirit

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.560 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be very
natural for someone

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to be able to touch
the other side

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and then bring that
gift back more strongly.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they better people?

00:28:25.475 --> 00:28:26.945 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Actually, yes.

00:28:26.945 --> 00:28:28.970 align:middle line:84%
I've never met anyone
that's had one and hasn't

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.740 align:middle line:84%
come back and decided
that they needed

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:36.050 align:middle line:84%
to make more out of their life
or live better, love more, help

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:37.055 align:middle line:90%
others.

00:28:37.055 --> 00:28:39.718 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they enlightened
when they come back?

00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes, absolutely.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:84%
You can't go to that
level or that dimension

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and get that knowing and
come back the same person.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:90%
You really can't.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was part of the reason
why I believe my marriage that

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:84%
was 25 years ended because
you cannot have a near-death

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.380 align:middle line:84%
experience and come back the
person you were before that.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting point.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Are you glad this
happened to you?

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: I am glad for the
knowledge and the connection

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:90%
that I have.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.085 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
challenging way to do it.

00:29:08.085 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
go through it again?

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: I would.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I would do it again if
that was the only way

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.315 align:middle line:90%
to be who I am today.

00:29:14.315 --> 00:29:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you tell people

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:22.080 align:middle line:84%
who have had these experiences
that just feel on edge?

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
important for them

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:84%
to know that there
are many people who've

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:84%
had near-death experiences
or out-of-body experiences.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And so finding communities
that can help support them

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.100 align:middle line:84%
through that would be
really wonderful for them.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of places
that we can find out more.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.980 align:middle line:84%
If you just go online,
you'll find out

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.410 align:middle line:84%
a lot more about
groups that talk

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:84%
about these near-death
experiences.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.360 align:middle line:90%
You're not alone in this.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think people do
feel alone in this.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:52.005 align:middle line:84%
It took me weeks before I would
even talk about these to people.

00:29:52.005 --> 00:29:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to be
particularly religious to have

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:56.550 align:middle line:90%
these experiences?

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: No.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.348 align:middle line:84%
Here's one of the amazing
things we're learning

00:29:59.348 --> 00:30:00.900 align:middle line:90%
with near-death experiences.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:07.560 align:middle line:84%
We're actually using AI to
chronologically order what's

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.770 align:middle line:90%
happening with them.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And with that, what
we're finding is

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.390 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter your
gender, your race,

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:84%
your age when you
die, how you died,

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:90%
what continent you live in.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.640 align:middle line:84%
What matters is that
all of these people

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.740 align:middle line:84%
or the majority of
them are experiencing

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.170 align:middle line:84%
the same thing, which
is timelessness,

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:84%
unconditional love, reunion
with family on the other side,

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.110 align:middle line:84%
seeing angels,
seeing life guides.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And so with all of
this information,

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.600 align:middle line:84%
we can start to predict
what the next 100

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.836 align:middle line:84%
people who have near-death
experiences will experience.

00:30:40.836 --> 00:30:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, if you did not
come back but you moved on,

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.660 align:middle line:90%
what would have happened?

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.030 align:middle line:84%
How would that
transition have occurred?

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Well, I believe
that at that point in time,

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:90%
I would have passed in the fall.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I probably
would have gone on

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.010 align:middle line:84%
to keep learning
because we don't

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:90%
stop learning in spirit world.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But the lessons
that we learn there

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.620 align:middle line:84%
are a little bit different
than they are here.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I like to compare it to when
I was 16 and in high school,

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.480 align:middle line:84%
we had a driving
simulator for driver's ed.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: And being
in spirit world

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.110 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit where you
get to take the driver's

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.660 align:middle line:90%
test on the simulation machine.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But when you come
here to planet Earth,

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.200 align:middle line:84%
it's a different
level of learning.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.722 align:middle line:90%
It's boots on the ground.

00:31:24.722 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Your hands are getting
dirty and you're all in,

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.050 align:middle line:84%
which is different when we're
driving a car than being

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:90%
in a simulator.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So I might have still been able
to learn some of my lessons,

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.350 align:middle line:84%
but it wouldn't have
been to the depth

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.870 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to learn
them by being here in body.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had near-death
experience number four

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and they gave you that option,
stay or go back, what would you

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:46.975 align:middle line:90%
do this time?

00:31:46.975 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Well, that's
a big question.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I keep telling everyone
that if I have a fourth one,

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.097 align:middle line:90%
it's my last one and I'm out.

00:31:53.097 --> 00:31:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not coming back?

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.285 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: I think
number four will be it.

00:31:56.285 --> 00:31:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why give up?

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.320 align:middle line:90%
You're still way too young.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Well, here's the thing.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I've been told by
my guides I'm not

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:04.450 align:middle line:84%
going to have another near-death
experience, that those

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:90%
are behind me for now.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Now is my time to--

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
want any more?

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: No.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm good.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.606 align:middle line:84%
I think I've learned
my hardest lessons.

00:32:11.606 --> 00:32:13.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that mean
you're giving up?

00:32:13.255 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: No, it just means
that I have grown enough

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.000 align:middle line:84%
that now I can find other ways
to learn and connect with spirit

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and share those messages
without always having to do it

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:22.900 align:middle line:90%
the hard way.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.483 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did
you become a medium?

00:32:24.483 --> 00:32:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: So I've been practicing
my mediumship for eight years

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:28.780 align:middle line:90%
now professionally.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.210 align:middle line:84%
But after my third
near-death experience,

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I started mentoring
with different mediums

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:90%
and honing in on my abilities.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I did not know how to
use this prior to that.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you have
learned it in a big way now.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:43.165 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Absolutely.

00:32:43.165 --> 00:32:46.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
become a certified medium?

00:32:46.495 --> 00:32:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: So I did a
certification testing program.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.225 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was they
had me log on to Skype--

00:32:52.225 --> 00:32:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who certifies you?

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: So Mark Ireland is
the gentleman who certified me.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: And you can
find his website online,

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.115 align:middle line:90%
find a certified medium.

00:33:00.115 --> 00:33:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he accredited or--

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: He is.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's worked with
different scientists.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.763 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Gary Schwartz, I believe--

00:33:06.763 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gary is a good guy.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So what he does is he sets
up blind Skype readings.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So I would be told
get on Zoom or Skype

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.050 align:middle line:90%
at 11:00 AM on Wednesday.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.030 align:middle line:90%
I would log on.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.670 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't know if it's a man
or a woman or where they lived,

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and I would just start
giving them the information

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.050 align:middle line:84%
that I was getting
from their loved one.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, they're sitting there
scoring me and marking down

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:90%
the information.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.462 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You passed
with flying colors.

00:33:32.462 --> 00:33:33.295 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Absolutely.

00:33:33.295 --> 00:33:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have free
will on the other side?

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: We do.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We have free will there
and we have free will here.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So our souls choose to come
back because we want to.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.830 align:middle line:84%
No one is ever
forced to come back.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.290 align:middle line:84%
You're not forced to come
back to live another life

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.990 align:middle line:84%
or to be a cockroach
in this lifetime

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:middle line:84%
because you did something
bad in the last one.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: So we have free
will there to choose

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.710 align:middle line:90%
our life plan or our blueprint.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And then once we get to human
form, we also have free will.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So we can try to stay in
alignment and accomplish that

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.625 align:middle line:84%
or we can be like a dog and
chase our tail in a circle.

00:34:07.625 --> 00:34:10.639 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who signs these
soul contracts with us?

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: These
are contracts made

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:15.387 align:middle line:84%
between our soul, God's source,
the divine, your life guides,

00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:90%
and your guardian angels.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.512 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you break it?

00:34:17.512 --> 00:34:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: You can alter it.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.199 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I want
to use the word break,

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:22.190 align:middle line:90%
but you can change it.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.467 align:middle line:90%
There can be a point in time--

00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can they change it too?

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.133 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: They can change it too.

00:34:26.133 --> 00:34:30.080 align:middle line:84%
It would be an agreement, so
it would be a mutual consent

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:30.925 align:middle line:90%
to change it.

00:34:30.925 --> 00:34:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like you're not
going to go down the hell.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to keep
you up here in heaven.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:36.774 align:middle line:90%
What if they changed their mind?

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: That's not
going to happen.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.340 align:middle line:84%
As long as you realize
that we are all here

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.483 align:middle line:84%
beings of light no
matter, what you're doing,

00:34:44.483 --> 00:34:45.400 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to see that.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're watching
the news, you're

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.340 align:middle line:84%
not going to look around
saying, look at all

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.420 align:middle line:90%
of these beings of light.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.270 align:middle line:90%
You're not.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.870 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, we are
all sparks of the light.

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:54.934 align:middle line:84%
And we've come from
that heavenly realm

00:34:54.934 --> 00:34:56.559 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
we're going to return.

00:34:56.559 --> 00:34:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us an
example of somebody

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:02.140 align:middle line:84%
you know who had a
near-death experience

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.775 align:middle line:90%
and it changed their life.

00:35:03.775 --> 00:35:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Oh my goodness, I've met
so many amazing people

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.490 align:middle line:90%
with near-death experiences.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the top ones
that I can think of

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.100 align:middle line:84%
was actually a gentleman who
had a negative near-death

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So he told me that he
had been living life

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.930 align:middle line:84%
as a rotten person
just doing very--

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Heinous things.

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.138 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Heinous things, yes.

00:35:24.138 --> 00:35:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Mean things, not caring
about anyone else.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me at
that point in time,

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.270 align:middle line:90%
he was in a motorcycle accident.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:33.190 align:middle line:90%
He died.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And he remembers
being in what he

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:41.220 align:middle line:84%
called hell, which was dark,
cold, feeling agonizing--

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Empty.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Empty.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:43.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But what he said
to me is something

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.990 align:middle line:84%
that I hear from
spirit world too.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.030 align:middle line:84%
He was basically
begging God, I don't

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.250 align:middle line:90%
want this to be my eternity.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Please don't let this
be where I'm going.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, a hand
came down into the darkness.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:01.310 align:middle line:84%
A huge giant hand reached in and
pulled him out and pulled him

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:02.930 align:middle line:90%
back into the light.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And he says he came
back and it took him

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:07.940 align:middle line:84%
years to recover from
his physical injuries.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.800 align:middle line:84%
But he knew now in his mind that
he wanted to be a good person.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
live a better life.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And he's absolutely
changed his life around.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he had
something to live for.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Absolutely.

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
spirit has told

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.560 align:middle line:84%
me is that when people have
these experiences that someone

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.140 align:middle line:84%
might consider negative,
there are always

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:84%
beams of light around them
to hold the space for them

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.810 align:middle line:84%
to come back up into
that heavenly realm.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we all
have this potential

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.155 align:middle line:90%
of being a medium or a psychic?

00:36:36.155 --> 00:36:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Absolutely.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:90%
It's our natural soul's gift.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
like doing math.

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Some people can practice
it and get better

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:90%
and become physicists.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Other people will practice it
and get to a certain level.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And mediumship is very
similar with that.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It's our natural connection
to source and our loved ones.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michelle, how do we
know a near-death experience is

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:58.040 align:middle line:84%
real and that it's not
some fluke of the mind

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.240 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of state?

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Right.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.872 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
that I can tell you

00:37:01.872 --> 00:37:03.650 align:middle line:84%
many near-death
experiencers have said

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:07.970 align:middle line:84%
is that it is more vivid and
more real than me sitting here

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:08.940 align:middle line:90%
with you today.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:12.230 align:middle line:84%
The colors, the sounds,
the unconditional love,

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:15.590 align:middle line:84%
it's like it makes this life
feel like we have a Halloween

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:18.710 align:middle line:84%
costume on or a costume
on and then we step out

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.310 align:middle line:90%
into who we really are.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:22.470 align:middle line:90%
So truly by the emotions.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:26.180 align:middle line:84%
The other things we know is that
many near-death experiencers

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.460 align:middle line:84%
see things happening
in the operating room

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.830 align:middle line:84%
or in places that
they're not that there's

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.080 align:middle line:84%
no way they would be able
to see if they were just

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.160 align:middle line:90%
connected to their body.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can science ever
prove the existence of NDEs?

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely believe we are
working on that right now

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:42.800 align:middle line:90%
and that it will be proven soon.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would be
dramatic if they can.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:45.992 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Mm-hmm.

00:37:45.992 --> 00:37:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
the main lessons

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.775 align:middle line:90%
you've learned from NDEs.

00:37:48.775 --> 00:37:50.035 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Oh, my goodness.

00:37:50.035 --> 00:37:51.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, one thing I learned--

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It has
changed you, hasn't it?

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Oh, it has changed me.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that we've come
to learn and play and grow

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.450 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth, that this
isn't a prison sentence.

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:05.650 align:middle line:84%
This is actually an
exploration of life here.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.360 align:middle line:84%
You need to think of
yourself like you're

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.060 align:middle line:84%
exploring the universe
being on planet Earth.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that life guides
are real, angels are real.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Our loved ones do
have psychic ability.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.870 align:middle line:84%
My grandma knew that
I was coming that day,

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:19.510 align:middle line:90%
and she was waiting for me.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that
we all have angels.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that there
is an unconditional loving

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:28.660 align:middle line:84%
being source that is wanting
to connect with each of us

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.007 align:middle line:90%
every moment of our lives.

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your
grandmother send you back?

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: She didn't
send me back.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But when I came
back into my body,

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.870 align:middle line:84%
it felt like I had been dropped
out of a 10-storey building.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:38.260 align:middle line:90%
It felt--

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, god.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: --heavy.

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.915 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've gone through
a lot of pain in these things.

00:38:40.915 --> 00:38:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: I have.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some NDEs aren't
that painful, right?

00:38:44.575 --> 00:38:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Correct.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And some people have
NDEs where they actually

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:51.330 align:middle line:84%
receive miraculous healings
like Anita Moorjani.

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yeah.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
pretty dramatic.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: It was very dramatic.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And mine, for me, dying is the
easy part, going into the light,

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.888 align:middle line:84%
being on the other side,
experience that is easy.

00:39:01.888 --> 00:39:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Then I come back and I have to
work through the physical part

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:05.230 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you
recommend to somebody

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:10.070 align:middle line:90%
who's afraid of dying?

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Oh, my goodness.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.263 align:middle line:10%
Well, I would say number
one, know that you're not

00:39:13.263 --> 00:39:14.280 align:middle line:10%
living this life alone.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.040 align:middle line:10%
So no one dies alone.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.530 align:middle line:10%
Your loved ones are
still connected to you

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.900 align:middle line:10%
whether you're connecting with
them and seeing it or not.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.050 align:middle line:10%
And so when we realize
that we're actually

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:27.200 align:middle line:10%
stepping into a realm where
we're connected to the loved

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.650 align:middle line:10%
ones who have gone before us and
still connected here to planet

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:32.960 align:middle line:10%
Earth, we don't actually
need to be afraid

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.110 align:middle line:10%
because there is a greater
awareness and a greater love

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.800 align:middle line:10%
that's available to all of us.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those of us who have
not had a near-death experience,

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.820 align:middle line:90%
are we missing out on anything?

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Well, you're missing
out on the trauma part of it,

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:49.820 align:middle line:84%
of the healing that you'll
have to do with your body

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.750 align:middle line:90%
when you come back.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.260 align:middle line:90%
But no, I don't think so.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I think because of the world we
live in now with the internet

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and people can
learn these lessons

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:00.510 align:middle line:84%
without having to physically
experience it for themselves.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.330 align:middle line:90%
So it's about how open you are.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:03.828 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to
learn the easy way

00:40:03.828 --> 00:40:05.370 align:middle line:84%
or do you want to
learn the hard way?

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
learn the easy way,

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:10.410 align:middle line:84%
we have this opportunity
to access information

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:11.670 align:middle line:90%
where it's endless.

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
start to connect and feel

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.300 align:middle line:90%
this immense love that is here.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.525 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
you can't come back?

00:40:19.525 --> 00:40:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Well, if
you can't come back--

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.942 align:middle line:84%
and that happens to a
lot of people, right?

00:40:22.942 --> 00:40:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know how many
of them were not given a choice.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.138 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
die in their sleep.

00:40:27.138 --> 00:40:28.650 align:middle line:90%
They just don't come back.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Right.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.560 align:middle line:84%
But you're still connected
to your loved ones

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.630 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't come
back into your body.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michelle, how do people
contact you or follow your work?

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Yes.

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:41.940 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way is through my
website, MichelleClare.net.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm on Instagram.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm on Facebook.

had a near-death experience.

I'm not in a rush to get to one.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But if it ever happens
to me, at least

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:84%
by talking to people
like Michelle Clare,

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.390 align:middle line:90%
I know what to expect.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:05.520 align:middle line:90%
