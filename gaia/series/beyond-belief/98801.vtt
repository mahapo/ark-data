00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOB GLOTZHOBER: Hi.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm coach Bob.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Did you know the
energy in our bodies,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.830 align:middle line:84%
coupled with the energy we
get from those around us

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and the places we go,
can make our lives

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.730 align:middle line:90%
either heaven or hell.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Today on "Beyond
Belief," I'm going

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:84%
to explain how to manage
your energy so you

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:84%
can make a positive impact on
any situation in your life.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.912 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:28.120 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.972 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:10%
This is going to be a
fascinating program,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.280 align:middle line:10%
and it's really important to me
too, because it strikes home.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:10%
Coach Bob is our special guest.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:10%
Coach Bob-- his real
name is Bob Glotzhober--

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:10%
is a reality coach, is
a life-changing coach.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:10%
He absolutely gets
involved in your life

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:10%
and is able to tell you various
things about yourself that

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.400 align:middle line:10%
can change your life, change
your perspective on many things

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:10%
that have been
happening in your life

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:10%
and that can happen
in your life.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.531 align:middle line:10%
Bob, welcome to
"Beyond Belief," coach.

00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BOB: Thanks for
having me, George.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.696 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure.

00:01:24.696 --> 00:01:27.327 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So why do they
call you Coach Bob?

00:01:27.327 --> 00:01:28.910 align:middle line:10%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Well,
believe it or not,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.740 align:middle line:10%
it started because I was
coaching Little League

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:10%
baseball with my children
when I was younger,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.610 align:middle line:10%
and the name just kind of stuck.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:10%
So it's kind of
strange that I morphed

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:10%
into being a life
and business coach,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:10%
and the name just
stuck all these years.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, full
disclosure of course,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:84%
with our "Beyond Belief"
audience and viewers,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.070 align:middle line:84%
you've been a dear friend of our
family for a number of years.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And Bob has helped us out
through various episodes

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.785 align:middle line:90%
in our career.

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Part of living is the
tragedies of living,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and Bob has been with our
family through my father's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:84%
passing several years
ago and most recently

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:84%
the death of my sister, who
died of Stage 4 brain cancer.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And Bob, I have to
first of all tell you

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.490 align:middle line:90%
what you did for our family.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:90%
I can never thank you enough.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Well, I
appreciate that, George.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I've been around you
guys for over 20 years.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And like you say, it's
not if tough things are

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.320 align:middle line:90%
going to find us, it's when.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And so, being prepared
when those solutions arise

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
allows me to be able to help
people when they're going

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:90%
through the toughest times.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
experience of knowing

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
how to deal with
tough situations

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that I try to share to
try to make other people's

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:90%
lives a little bit better.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are
tough times right now.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
People are faced with just about
everything-- economic problems,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
wars and strife all
are on this planet,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:84%
the situation with Ebola and
how bad is that going to get.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.824 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Yep.

00:03:04.824 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bob, I've
never seen them

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:90%
more up tight in all my life.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Do you sense that, in your
travels and where you go,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.460 align:middle line:84%
that no matter where you
are, people are just, like,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:90%
wound up, ready to pop?

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER:
There's no question.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
George, I grew up in Detroit
in the '50s and '60s.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.735 align:middle line:84%
We were the motor
capital of the world,

00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and we thought we
were living in heaven.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And comparing that to what
we're going through now,

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:84%
it's like I'm living
in a different world.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And
the tension, you

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:90%
can even cut it with a knife.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And so, learning
techniques to be

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
able to deal with
that tension is

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.617 align:middle line:84%
going to be the difference
between heaven and hell.

00:03:45.617 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But we see episodes,
for example,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.905 align:middle line:84%
of children who are well-liked,
who are in their school,

00:03:54.905 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and the kid pulls
out a gun, a pistol,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:90%
and starts shooting and killing.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And everybody says,
how can this be?

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:84%
He was fine yesterday,
he was happy.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Right.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
happening to people?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Yeah, and
that's a big question,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of
an unknown answer.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, why do bad things
happen to good people,

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:90%
we've always wondered that.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And so, since I
really can't answer

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.120 align:middle line:84%
that question,
what I try to do is

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I say, when those bad things
happen, what's the best

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:90%
we can do?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.280 align:middle line:84%
How do we survive,
how do we move on,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:84%
how do we make it better
because they happened,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.332 align:middle line:84%
instead of shrivel
up and never recover.

00:04:36.332 --> 00:04:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You learned
a lot over the years

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
from a psychologist
named William Hall.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about William Hall.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Bill Hall
was one of the nicest,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:90%
smartest men I've ever met.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.620 align:middle line:84%
He came up in psychology,
when it was new,

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:84%
with Abraham Maslow
and Kyle Young

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:90%
and some of the other greats.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And his whole bet was,
he didn't want to study

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:90%
what made us messed up.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to study why
were the people that

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
really were doing something
positive, what were they

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:90%
all about.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And going through
that, looking back--

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know it at
the time-- I was picking up

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
that what was different between
the people that were helping

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and hurting was the energy
running through them,

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.970 align:middle line:90%
the energy coming off of them.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's why I've kind
of made it my life's mission

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand how
we can control that energy

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:90%
to make things better.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What made
that change for you?

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:84%
When you became Coach Bob,
through the Little League

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.380 align:middle line:84%
process, what made
you decide, I'm

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:84%
going to start
helping people, I'm

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.060 align:middle line:84%
going to start helping
corporations-- because you

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:90%
get involved in everything.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.804 align:middle line:90%
What was that catalyst for you?

00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Well, to be
perfectly honest with you,

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
George, I was 40
years old, I was

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.090 align:middle line:84%
getting ready to blow lot
of my second marriage,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I had successful businesses
in the financial sector,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:90%
but I was miserable.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And I told myself, if all
there is, is making more money

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and going more places
and being this miserable,

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather swallow the barrel.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Heh.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.683 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And so, it
took me about five years

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.270 align:middle line:84%
to financially sell my
businesses and get out.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And I went on a
three year sabbatical

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to where I just started reading
and studying philosophy,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.160 align:middle line:90%
science--

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Trying
to find yourself?

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.766 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: --and just
wanted to piece it together

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:41.590 align:middle line:90%
for myself.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And how I put it
together, which I

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:84%
think is a very
interesting thing,

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:84%
is I'd come up with a
principle or concept

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.940 align:middle line:84%
that I thought might work with
something going on in my life.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:90%
So I'd try it on for one week.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I still do
one-week experiments,

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
because after a week,
if you try something,

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
you can see if things are better
or if they're worse, right.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.991 align:middle line:90%
You'll get those results.

00:07:01.991 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: So if it worked
in that area of my life,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I didn't incorporated it,
I tried it in another area.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And back then, I defined it as
four areas-- family, friends,

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:84%
lovers, and business, which
is what was surrounding me.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So if it worked in
every area, then

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:90%
I made it part of my philosophy.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And so, over the years, that's
how I built the way I coach,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:90%
is by following that.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's been very sound, and
I've never seen it not work.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.262 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it trial and
error in the beginning?

00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Oh!

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Completely trial and error.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And
like everything, you

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:84%
do it once, you know something,
you do it twice more.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's why I started
staying away from the truth,

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
because my truth kept
changing as I knew more.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want
to know the truth,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I wanted there
always to be more.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.850 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be able to help
more and more and more,

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and so that's kind
of the process.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
been a believer, Bob,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
in energy in that it
affects us directly

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:90%
with what we do in our lives.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean the energy
of, wow, I'm up 14 hours

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still going
and stuff like.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a subtle
energy in this universe

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:84%
that I think people have
the ability to tap into.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:84%
You've looked at
that, and I think

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
you've concluded-- knowing
your work-- that if you

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.589 align:middle line:84%
can tap into this energy source,
you can do incredible things.

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Yeah.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's 100%
all about energy.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:84%
The reason I study
the brain is because I

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:84%
want to know, how can my
brain control my energy.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, to me, it's
really all about energy.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you look into it,
from a scientific standpoint,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.710 align:middle line:84%
all the elements
we're made out of,

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, were made because
those elements

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.060 align:middle line:90%
were put in certain energies.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you put atoms and
molecules and certain energies,

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.260 align:middle line:84%
you have carbon, if you put
them in different energies,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:84%
you get iron, and all the way
up to the heavier elements.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And we know that everything
is made of energy.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:84%
So doesn't it only makes sense
that if everything's made out

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:84%
of energy, then energy
has to be what's

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.180 align:middle line:90%
really fueling what's going on?

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People sometimes
pull this black cloud

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.180 align:middle line:84%
over themselves, and they kind
of get this energy dissipated.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:84%
What do they do to change that,
which is part of the Coach Bob

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:30.827 align:middle line:90%
Real Life Change Program?

00:09:30.827 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Right.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you get people who

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:84%
are negative, who lack this
ability to tap into this energy

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:90%
force, to start doing that?

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: OK, well,
it's a complicated process.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:84%
But to boil it down to
basically three steps,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:52.770 align:middle line:84%
is you first have to be aware
of why you're surrounded

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:90%
by that negative energy.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:84%
If you're not aware of why
the black cloud is around you,

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
there's not much
you can do with it.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just like if you're
going to fix a TV,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand how the
TV works or you can't fix it.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or your car,
or anything, right?

00:10:09.027 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Right, everything.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
you have to do,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I
do in my coaching,

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:84%
is to explain to people
how they're made up,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
what are they really all
about, so that they understand

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.260 align:middle line:90%
why the black cloud is there.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're almost like
a therapist, aren't you?

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.291 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Yeah.

00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I kind of favor that
word, but yeah, right.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.665 align:middle line:84%
Right, because I don't
believe anybody's messed up.

00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:33.770 align:middle line:90%
I believe we're all human.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like the
concept of ADD, for example.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:84%
There's so much stuff
about this ADD, well,

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't see it as ADD.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.840 align:middle line:84%
What I see is, I
know our brains--

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:84%
the first job of our brains--
is to look for survival.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So if something pops into my
brain that says I'm in danger,

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to immediately
address it, I have to.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: So if I'm reading
a book or you're talking to me

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a kid in class and
the teacher's talking, and all

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.120 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, into my
brain is, I forgot

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.160 align:middle line:90%
my lunch-- that's danger.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm immediately
going to go to it,

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to say
the kid's ADD because he's

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:90%
left the subject matter.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's really, I think, more
of a function of our energy.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Our energy's pulled
to the danger.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going
to stop, we're going

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to have to understand that, hey,
it's just natural that we're

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.920 align:middle line:84%
going to feel this
danger all the time,

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.850 align:middle line:90%
we can't get rid of that.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:84%
But what we can do,
which is the second step,

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:84%
is once you know it is,
you catch yourself when

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.350 align:middle line:90%
you've got that dark cloud.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And you take a deep breath
and step back and say,

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, that's
just the way I'm wired,

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to follow this,
and that's the second step.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that,
good things always happen.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is, you
have successful results.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And the more your brain
has successful results

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%
doing something a certain
way, it keeps doing it.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
tell yourself, I can

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.990 align:middle line:84%
do this-- whether it's a job,
or relationship, or health--

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:08.260 align:middle line:84%
can you turn that around if
you're positive about it?

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.025 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Yes.

00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:90%
It's motivation.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Motivation is a key.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.570 align:middle line:84%
We've all made New
Year's resolutions

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.360 align:middle line:84%
that don't make it out of the
first week of January, right?

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's because we
don't stay motivated.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one
of the things I

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:84%
do in my coaching is to
keep people motivated,

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
going on in their daily life

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:84%
that today they might really
want to conquer a problem

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:84%
or really want to
achieve something.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:84%
But then three days
go by, and now there's

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
problems with the
children, there's

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:84%
problems with their
finances, and they lose it.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's staying with
it, it's staying motivated.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I, to answer
your question,

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:84%
yes, I believe that if you
have a real interest in wanting

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.301 align:middle line:84%
to get somewhere, and you
stay motivated, no problem,

00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:90%
you could make it.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We are
human beings, coach,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and that means we're subject to
the frailties of being human.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:84%
We have the ups and we have the
downs-- it's going to happen.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.331 align:middle line:84%
I've gone through it,
you've gone through it.

00:13:06.331 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:84%
How do you pick yourself up
by the bootstraps, though?

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
What determines the difference
between that successful person

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.220 align:middle line:84%
who goes through these
tragedies of life

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.115 align:middle line:84%
and those who just
can't handle it?

00:13:20.115 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Well, let me
use an example in my own life.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Four
years ago, I went

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.962 align:middle line:90%
through major cancer surgery.

00:13:25.962 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you?

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:27.461 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Yeah.

00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And they cut out half my neck,
I went through the radiation

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:90%
and the chemo.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And a third of the way through
my treatments, my energy

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:90%
wasn't feeling right about it.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So I stopped my
chemo and radiation,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
which is maybe one of the
best things I ever did.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.298 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying other
people should do that,

00:13:44.298 --> 00:13:45.570 align:middle line:90%
but in my certain situation--

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.394 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your
doctors go crazy?

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: The medical
community wasn't thrilled,

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.440 align:middle line:90%
let's say that.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.910 align:middle line:90%
But that's the way it goes.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
But I went through it, and I
had a wonderful and marvelous

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:90%
experience with it.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason I did, in
answer to your question,

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:84%
is because when
tough things come,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
there's no chance
for you to change

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:84%
who you are and all of a
sudden muster up the strength.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.900 align:middle line:84%
What I've found, if you want
to beat the tough times,

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.212 align:middle line:84%
you have to prepare
during the better times.

00:14:18.212 --> 00:14:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And
so, what I did is,

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
I trained myself to be able
to control my energy so

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that when the tough things
come, I was prepared.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But what I really
feel bad about is,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:84%
sometimes people will come to
me, and they're not prepared,

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and they're absolutely
crushed by something--

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.535 align:middle line:84%
that's a much more difficult
situation to handle.

00:14:38.535 --> 00:14:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it is.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like, the worst
has already happened,

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:90%
they weren't ready for it--

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Right.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --or prepared for.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.166 align:middle line:84%
So how do you pull them
out of it, or can you?

00:14:49.166 --> 00:14:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: If you can
get them motivated enough--

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes people
hit the bottom

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.260 align:middle line:84%
to where they say no more,
and when they say no more,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:90%
then they're ready.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.360 align:middle line:84%
If they really want
it, they move forward.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:10%
They can pull
themselves out, but it

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:10%
takes a strong motivation
to be able to do it

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:10%
under those circumstances.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
That's why the other catch-22 is
that when people are feeling OK

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:84%
there's no reason to
work on themselves.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And so it's tough
for people to get

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.984 align:middle line:84%
prepared for the tough
things, because they say, hey,

00:15:22.984 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I've got too many
other things going on,

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:25.750 align:middle line:90%
why should I prepare now?

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Had a producer in St. Louis
when I was doing my local radio

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:29.959 align:middle line:90%
show there--

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: "The Night Hawk."

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.333 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "The Night Hawk."

00:15:32.333 --> 00:15:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And he knows I talk about him
and use this as an example

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.330 align:middle line:90%
wherever I go.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:84%
His name was Howard, and Howard
was the most negative human

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.190 align:middle line:90%
being that I had ever met.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:84%
What makes a person constantly
carry this black cloud

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:84%
over their head when
it's obvious you're not

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
going to get ahead in life
if you keep doing that?

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Well
from the latest

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:84%
in science and
technology we're finding

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:84%
that when the fetus
is in the womb,

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what's happening
around that fetus

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:84%
is having to do with how
their brain and their cells

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:90%
are developing.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.068 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At that point?

00:16:16.068 --> 00:16:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: At that point.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, genetics, the
DNA that the parents have

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.925 align:middle line:84%
given the child, and the
environment the fetus is,

00:16:24.925 --> 00:16:29.249 align:middle line:84%
is going to have a lot to
do with our basic nature.

00:16:29.249 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you might have
been behind the 8-ball

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:90%
before it even started, right?

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Well, and
then, once we come out,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.290 align:middle line:84%
all our brain's thinking
about is survival.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So depending on how
chaotic your environment

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:84%
is when you first enter
this world, that's

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
going to have a lot to do
with how much danger you're

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:90%
going to have to fight off.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, if we're
aware of that,

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.420 align:middle line:84%
then we can see that if
all that's happened to us

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.440 align:middle line:84%
is in the first couple
years-- we maybe

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
got the bad luck of the
draw-- then instead of looking

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:84%
at ourselves as losers or
failures, and we just see,

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.829 align:middle line:84%
hey, we got the bad luck of
the draw at the beginning,

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:84%
well there's something
we can do about it now.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's no reason we've got
to stay in that dark cloud.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me now about this
energy that you seem to believe

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
is so important-- and I
agree with you-- with people.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.829 align:middle line:84%
How do we control it, how do we
utilize it to better ourselves?

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.779 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: OK,
that's a great question,

00:17:28.779 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:84%
because I knew it was all
about energy, and I'm saying,

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:84%
but how can I touch so that
I can do something about it.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can I
take advantage of it.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:35.853 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Right.

00:17:35.853 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And how you take
advantage of it is,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:84%
think about all
the energy that's

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:44.760 align:middle line:84%
going to and coming at you as
being expressed through you,

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.720 align:middle line:90%
through your emotions.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions are
telling you the energy

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.620 align:middle line:84%
that's running through
you and the energy around.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a
frightening environment,

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
your emotions tell
you it's scary.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:84%
When you have money problem
or when you have people

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.410 align:middle line:84%
problems or you have
business problems,

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.637 align:middle line:84%
and inside you've
got a lot of angst--

00:18:03.637 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:90%
And these are real problems.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And these
are real problems.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So I target my
emotions, and I say, OK,

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
if I have a problem
or a situation

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:84%
that I want to deal
with, for one week

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to send it different
emotions, different energy,

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.210 align:middle line:90%
than what I normally send it.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So if I've got a
financial problem,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say you know what,
I'm going to relax this week,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to
see it as a problem,

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to let it be.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end
of the week I'll

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:84%
see, if everything's
made out of energy,

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and if I gave it
different energy,

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:84%
my financial situation should
be changed to some degree.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
find 100% of the time.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So the way you manage
your energy is learning

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:90%
how to manage your emotions.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And that gets back
to the first step,

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:84%
that's understanding
how you're put together

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and why your emotions are the
way they are to begin with.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should you sometimes
take this nonchalant attitude

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.470 align:middle line:90%
about things and about life?

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.985 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have a
relationship problem--

00:19:05.985 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:84%
don't let it bother you, oh
what they heck, life moves on,

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll get another girlfriend,
things will be fine.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:18.462 align:middle line:84%
Can you approach it that
way or is that too cavalier?

00:19:18.462 --> 00:19:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: I think
you can approach it

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
that way, I don't think it's
going to do you any good--

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I think it's
going to harm you.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: When it comes
to managing your energy,

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and we'll use relationships
as an example,

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:84%
if you really want a wonderful
relationship with someone,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:84%
send them wonderful energy,
not nonchalant energy.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:84%
If you don't really
care, well that's

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:84%
what they're going to pick up,
is that you really don't care.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's a discipline,
but it's fun.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
see that when you

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:84%
give life what you
want life to give you,

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and you see that it works
like that, what an adventure.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, and
an adventure it is.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Oh, yeah.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:54.936 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have notes.

00:19:54.936 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk with you
about road rage for second.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:90%
And we all drive cars.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:84%
This is my theory
now, and it took me

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:84%
years to get this together,
that road rage is caused

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:13.710 align:middle line:84%
by a bad driver who is either
not aware of how bad they

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
are or they're rude drivers
confronting an individual who's

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:90%
having a lousy day.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:84%
My theory is, the bad
driver cuts off this person,

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:84%
or the bad driver does
something stupid driving.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:84%
The guy having the lousy
day can't handle it,

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and he utilizes that road rage
episode to just let loose--

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.750 align:middle line:84%
whether he chases
the other individual

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.640 align:middle line:90%
I've experimented on myself.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I've had good days,
Bob, I've had bad days.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:49.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm a human.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Right.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm entitled to this.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Right.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have tried to
experiment that, on bad days--

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Perfect.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.426 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --somebody
does something

00:20:58.426 --> 00:21:02.130 align:middle line:84%
like that-- cuts me off or
something-- the normal thing

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to do in a road rage episode
is, you get ticked off.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Right.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What I did
was, I laughed it off.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, what a moron
that guy was the way he drove.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.720 align:middle line:84%
He could kill somebody,
he could have killed me,

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:90%
and you just don't get involved.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't chase him, you
don't give him the bird,

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:90%
you don't do any of that.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Right.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm convinced road
rage is based on the bad driver

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.317 align:middle line:84%
and the person having the
bad day, is that true?

00:21:32.317 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: I think
your 100% right.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Notice it's energy.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:90%
The bad driver has bad energy.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.700 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't care less about
the environment around him.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, he may be a
really good person--

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and this can help you
with your road rage,

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
you could think
that this bad driver

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.090 align:middle line:84%
may be a really good
person but having a really,

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:53.850 align:middle line:90%
really bad day.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:54.892 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a bad driver.

00:21:54.892 --> 00:21:56.933 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Or it could
be a bad driver, right.

00:21:56.933 --> 00:21:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And so you put that
negative energy,

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.070 align:middle line:84%
you mix that energy, with
the person he's cutting off.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.826 align:middle line:84%
And that negative
energy-- well, when

00:22:04.826 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:84%
you put two negative
energies together,

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.290 align:middle line:84%
what do you expect
to have happen?

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm laughing while you're
saying this, because I've

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:90%
been working on that currently.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going places,
and I'm watching,

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.152 align:middle line:84%
and anytime somebody
does something

00:22:18.152 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:84%
because they're
really not watching

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:24.045 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing on the
road, I get pissed off, right.

00:22:24.045 --> 00:22:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And so,
I laugh at myself,

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and I say, you know Bob,
you're a human being--

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't really help me.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I'll get in my car and
purposely run the experiment

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.170 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not going to
let my energy spike,

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.500 align:middle line:84%
no matter what anybody
does today on the road.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's always a much funner
trip and it's the way to go,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.004 align:middle line:90%
but it can be difficult.

00:22:45.004 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Coach Bob,
that's great advice.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I need people to
be able to do that, not

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
only in a road rage episode,
but also in a relationship

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.860 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to business
leaders and CEOs of companies

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:05.890 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to motivate their
employees, how do you do that?

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Well, my program
is a little bit different

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:84%
than most of the
programs corporations

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:84%
bring in to be able to
accomplish specific goals.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.560 align:middle line:84%
What my approach
is, is I'm saying,

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.390 align:middle line:84%
the calmer the
environment-- any time we're

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.310 align:middle line:84%
in pressure situations,
and with businesses

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.684 align:middle line:84%
now, there's less people,
there's a lot more pressure.

00:23:25.684 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
getting laid off.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.058 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: All that.

00:23:28.058 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So the calmer you could
make your employees,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:84%
the more efficient your
business is going to be.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I do
is say, hey, let's

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:40.920 align:middle line:84%
teach them that their calm
emotions make their best

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:84%
decisions-- not only
here at work, but at home

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.550 align:middle line:90%
and in everything else they do.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
They'll appreciate
you for helping them,

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:84%
not only here at work
but with our lives.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And by making a
calmer environment,

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.320 align:middle line:84%
things will be so much more
productive for everybody.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, can you turn
around a company, morale-wise,

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.810 align:middle line:84%
that, let's say they
employee 300 people,

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and then on a Friday the CEO
says, well we've just laid off

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:84%
100 of you, but the other 200
of you, you have a job for now.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people
would panic about that.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Well, and
they're going to panic.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:84%
What you can do that I've found
in dealing with companies,

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:84%
probably 30% or so
of the workforce

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.270 align:middle line:84%
will be open to a program
that helps them calm down,

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:84%
manager their energy so
they're going to be better off.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I'd say another 50%
are going to be really

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.510 align:middle line:84%
leery because of what the
company's done in the past

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.630 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But over time, as they
dabble in the experiment

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
with saying, hey, if I give this
part of my life better energy,

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.590 align:middle line:84%
better things do happen--
they come around.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got 20% of
them that just don't care,

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and there's not a whole
lot you're probably

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.024 align:middle line:90%
going to do for those.

00:24:55.024 --> 00:24:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's an
interesting phenomenon,

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's an interesting
field that you're in.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Where does it go,
what's the future look

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:84%
like for trying to get people
to understand real change?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: I think
it's accurate knowledge.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:10%
It's getting accurate
knowledge to people

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:10%
so they understand who
they are, how they operate,

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:22.270 align:middle line:10%
and what they have to do to
change to have a better life.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:26.190 align:middle line:10%
So I think it has to do with
becoming more aware of what's

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.100 align:middle line:10%
really going on.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Coach Bob,
what's your website,

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.975 align:middle line:84%
by the way, because
we're going to have

00:25:29.975 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:84%
a lot of "Beyond Belief" viewers
who want to say, how can I

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:90%
find this guy?

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.150 align:middle line:90%
How do they find Coach Bob?

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:10%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Well, they find
me at www.realchangecoach.com.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:42.417 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Real Change Coach.

00:25:42.417 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:10%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And I'm
going to put something

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.067 align:middle line:10%
up special for all your
"Beyond Belief" viewers.

00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Let's do that.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.769 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little surprise?

00:25:49.769 --> 00:25:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Going to be
a nice little surprise.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As we move forward
in our own personal lives,

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:84%
if health issues affect
people, can you still

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.210 align:middle line:84%
battle that, can
you still, like you

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.990 align:middle line:84%
did-- you had cancer, my
god, my sister had cancer,

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:12.470 align:middle line:84%
my dad died when he fell-- can
you really pull yourself out

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.730 align:middle line:84%
of it, or do you just accept
the fact that you have it

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:90%
and that's it?

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: I think
there is a lot we can do.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a new
microscope that just

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:84%
was invented that can watch--
and you can watch, in 3D,

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:90%
a cell separate.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you see that,
the energy that's

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:84%
flying on in that just
one cell in your body,

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.700 align:middle line:84%
it just shows you that with
all that energy going on

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.330 align:middle line:84%
inside your body,
if you're spiking it

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:84%
all the time with
your anger and fear,

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:84%
they're going to divide
and react totally different

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.750 align:middle line:84%
than if you're calm
and want to move

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.710 align:middle line:90%
in a more peaceful direction.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And that totally will
change your health

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and make you better,
no question about it.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I
think, without that,

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.625 align:middle line:84%
your health is not going
to get any better, is it?

00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: No way.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the real
travesty I see-- and I

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
think this is why I had a good
experience with my cancer--

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:84%
is when you get
sick, the tendency

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:84%
is to want to either get
angry or to become fearful.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you turn your
energy into anger and fear,

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.340 align:middle line:90%
you're not helping yourself.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not at all.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Not
at all-- you've

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:90%
got to fight that battle.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Coach Bob,
thanks for the advice,

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:90%
really appreciate it.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.025 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Thanks
for having me.

00:27:30.025 --> 00:27:30.816 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Coach Bob.

00:27:30.816 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:10%
It's called "Real
Change," and perhaps it's

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.300 align:middle line:10%
time for you to change.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.940 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
