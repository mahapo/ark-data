00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.898 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:10.648 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:13.640 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.382 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.382 --> 00:00:19.175 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.175 --> 00:00:25.717 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:28.300 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And welcome to
this edition of "Beyond Belief"

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.070 align:middle line:10%
with our special guest,
journalist and researcher

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:10%
Chris Geo, back,
talking about survival.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.280 align:middle line:84%
As many of you
know, my campaign is

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:84%
to insulate our power grid from
an EMP attack or even some kind

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:90%
of an x-flare from the sun.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, just a few
weeks ago, our government

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
came out with a
report that China

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:84%
may be capable of hacking into
our grid and shutting it down.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
We have had severe weather
this coming season.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Buffalo, seven feet of snow.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Roofs collapsing, people trapped
under their houses for weeks.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:90%
How do you survive?

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.210 align:middle line:84%
With Chris Geo, we're going
to talk about survival.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.010 align:middle line:84%
He's also a
communications director

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.960 align:middle line:84%
for MyPatriotSupply.com,
an emerging

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.987 align:middle line:84%
company in the
survival business.

00:01:17.987 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Chris, good to have you with us.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.278 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS GEO: Thank you.

00:01:20.278 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Survival
is so critical.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:90%
So critical.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: It really is.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:10%
And as a journalist, when you
have your finger on the pulse,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:10%
you really understand
what's going on

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:10%
and how many situations
we are really looking at.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a kid growing
up in the '50s and the '60s,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I remember the school
fallout shelter drills,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:84%
where we had to hide under
desks and curl into our knees.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
People were building fallout
shelters in their basements.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:84%
There was a massive
paranoia of survival.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:84%
We're back in an era again where
I think the quest for survival

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.730 align:middle line:84%
is more extreme than it was
then and more necessary.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:90%
People need their guns.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:90%
They need storable food.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:90%
They need to put water.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:90%
They need to build shelters.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:90%
They need to have a plan.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.682 align:middle line:84%
Are many of them
developing this plan today?

00:02:17.682 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: I hope so.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.431 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we strive
for at MyPatriotSupply,

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:23.620 align:middle line:10%
is to make sure that
everybody can prepare

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:10%
and everybody has
a plan, as well.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think
preparedness has always

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:84%
been something that's
important to people

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of time.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really
something in the modern age,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:84%
because we saw it during the
time of the Great Depression.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing it during
the time of World War II.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing it now.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But now it is becoming even
that much more important,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:84%
because, as you mentioned
in the beginning,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.150 align:middle line:84%
we are experiencing very
strange weather, the threat

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
of solar flares, the threat of
an EMP from another country.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And all we need is one
solar flare to knock out

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
our satellites, and we will
be back to the stone age,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
rubbing two sticks
together to make fire,

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.536 align:middle line:90%
as Brooks Agnew would say.

00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember a
story back in St. Louis

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:90%
happened a long time ago, Chris.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.417 align:middle line:84%
There was a power outage in a
little area of some businesses.

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:08.875 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to go
to the drugstore

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:10.574 align:middle line:90%
to pick up some stuff.

00:03:10.574 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know if
they were open or closed.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.242 align:middle line:84%
It was daytime, so
you couldn't really

00:03:14.242 --> 00:03:15.700 align:middle line:84%
see if there were
lights on or not.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But there were a lot of
cars in the parking lot,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:90%
so I figured, all right.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:90%
They're probably open.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.860 align:middle line:90%
And I went.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
The manager was standing
at the inside of the door,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:84%
saying it's going to
take a little longer.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:90%
We're doing everything by hand.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So you find what you
want, and then we'll

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:90%
do what we have to do.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.220 align:middle line:90%
That lasted five minutes.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.560 align:middle line:90%
The line was 30 people deep.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
They had a counter there--
a cash register person--

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.010 align:middle line:90%
who was trying to make change.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't use
your credit card.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't even
add and subtract, right.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:84%
They would say, well,
your bill's $9.68.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:90%
You give them a $20.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
get $10.32 back.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.560 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know how to do it.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.844 align:middle line:84%
So they stopped, and
they chased us all out.

00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:01.676 align:middle line:84%
They said, you're going
to have to come back

00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:02.830 align:middle line:90%
when the power's up.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:84%
That's just one element
of what could go wrong

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:84%
when the power goes out-- when
the grid goes down just for one

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.100 align:middle line:90%
split second.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:90%
You can't pump gasoline.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Your water is pumped to
you by electric generators

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:90%
from the water company.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you turn the
faucet on and there it is.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's pumping it to you.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:90%
This is chaos at its worst.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:90%
How do you prepare for this?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I've seen it first
hand, unfortunately.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:90%
I was down in Hurricane Ike.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:90%
And same scenario.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:84%
There was no gas
available within the city

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:84%
because everything was flooded
and there was no electricity.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Outside of the city, I was
watching people go crazy.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fighting, everything.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:10%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.665 align:middle line:10%
Somebody tried to
run me over because I

00:04:47.665 --> 00:04:49.206 align:middle line:10%
was standing in
front of the gas pump

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:51.037 align:middle line:10%
while somebody was
bringing my car up.

00:04:51.037 --> 00:04:52.245 align:middle line:90%
And we were waiting in line--

00:04:52.245 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they wanted
you out of the way, right?

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And so when I see what people
are capable of in a situation--

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking
about gas here.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we're talking about
food, now, all of a sudden.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just look at
Black Friday, what

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:90%
happens on Black Friday.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
People will kill each
other over plastic garbage.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
When it's food,
it's going to be--

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they wait
in line all night long.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.845 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
a big situation.

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So me, personally, I like
to be in a place mentally

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.252 align:middle line:84%
and also physically
with my supplies

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to where I don't have
to leave the house.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And I can sustain myself in
my home for several months,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:90%
if needed.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're unusual.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
But what's a good average to
sustain yourself in general?

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.197 align:middle line:90%
A couple weeks?

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I would say anywhere
from a couple of weeks

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to a few years, just depending
on whatever you can afford

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and whatever you
can put together.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But have some kind of
preparedness plan, hands

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:90%
down, regardless of the size.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, the
Mormon religion--

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.259 align:middle line:84%
they believe in preparing
for seven years.

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: There's some
wisdom to that.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And most of them have seven
years' of storable food and are

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.660 align:middle line:90%
stocked up.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, if you're lucky
to live in an area that is not

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.360 align:middle line:84%
so climately
controlled-- for example,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:84%
if you're living in the Midwest,
and in the dead of the winter,

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
your power goes out, and
it's 10 degrees outside,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:90%
you're up a creek.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Your pipes freeze,
they burst, and there's

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
nothing you can
do in your house,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:84%
because you look at
your thermometer,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's slowly going
down, down, down.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.086 align:middle line:84%
What do you do about
something like that?

00:06:20.086 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: That's a situation
where you need to really think

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
about how you're going to either
heat the area that you're in

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.060 align:middle line:90%
or get out.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.226 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you're
stuck in the middle

00:06:30.226 --> 00:06:32.000 align:middle line:84%
of a snowstorm in the
middle of nowhere.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that an igloo can
maintain temperatures inside

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:84%
of it of 60 to 70 degrees,
while outside it's below zero?

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're saying
we should all build igloos?

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: No, no, no,
I'm just saying,

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:84%
these little bits of
knowledge and wisdom--

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:84%
if you just spend
five minutes a day

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.156 align:middle line:84%
just learning a new survival
tactic every single day,

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
before you know
it, you'll become

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:90%
an encyclopedia of information.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.916 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gas heaters,
things like that.

00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.220 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:84%
You can use your car to make
electricity to power a heater

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:84%
or something-- or something
similar to a heater.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris,
people go ballistic

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.805 align:middle line:84%
after the power's
out for three hours.

00:07:03.805 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Oh, I know.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They go crazy.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:90%
They can't handle it.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: I know.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.860 align:middle line:84%
We had the power go out
for about three hours--

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.824 align:middle line:84%
and this was before I got into
the preparedness mentality.

00:07:13.824 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.489 align:middle line:84%
It's a preparedness
mentality, because you

00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:84%
have to have the
mindset, first of all.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, you take
care of the rest.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:90%
And we were in a condo.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.732 align:middle line:84%
And the power went out for about
six hours in Denver, Colorado.

00:07:25.732 --> 00:07:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And this was in
the dead of winter.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.773 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cold.

00:07:27.773 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
I went to turn on
the fireplace, and I

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
realized that the fireplace
was even electric in itself.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
not going to work.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: No.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, I have a
beautiful wife that I

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.822 align:middle line:90%
was able to cuddle up next to.

00:07:38.822 --> 00:07:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.962 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's not
going to help us.

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: But it was at that
point that I realized

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that I need to do
something about this.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.681 align:middle line:84%
I need to make some plans,
and I needed to be prepared.

00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:51.176 align:middle line:84%
So I keep an abundance
of blankets, firewood.

00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:52.800 align:middle line:84%
I have a place where
I can make a fire.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you may
not even touch it.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Right.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.418 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may
not even touch it.

00:07:55.418 --> 00:07:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But you still feel--
like an insurance policy,

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:84%
which you may never
use-- it's there.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Let me share a story with you.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I was driving from
Colorado to Mt.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.472 align:middle line:84%
Shasta to get married
on December 21, 2012,

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:84%
because if something was
going to happen on that day,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I was going to get
married to my wife.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you were listening
to "Coast to Coast" on the way.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was my Friday
night show, I think.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Absolutely.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And we were driving
on about four inches

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:90%
of ice the entire way.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:90%
It was nuts.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what we were
thinking about doing.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:84%
But I felt secure in doing
so because I had flares

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
in the back, and I had a couple
of weeks' of storable food

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:90%
and water filtration.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:84%
We had these little devices
called the LifeStraw.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:84%
And consequently,
MyPatriotSupply.com, you

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:90%
can pick those up there.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.549 align:middle line:84%
But they're little devices,
and you can literally

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.904 align:middle line:84%
put them in water and
filter your water like that.

00:08:43.904 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You scoop it?

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: No, no, no, you
suck it like a straw.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.649 align:middle line:90%
So you can--

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like right through it?

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Like right through it.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So you can just put it in any
kind of contaminated water--

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.902 align:middle line:84%
put the straw right in,
and suck it up, clean.

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And they've done
testing that it gets out

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:90%
99.999% of the contaminants.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I know that there have
been other filtration

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
systems in development
by our company.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And they will put it
through all kinds of tests.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.190 align:middle line:84%
They will not release
a product until it

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:84%
has been tested a million times
over and then retested again

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.660 align:middle line:90%
to ensure--

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right--
just to make sure.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.015 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:09:16.015 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So we were driving
up this mountain.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.192 align:middle line:84%
And it got to a place
to where we really

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
thought we were going to get
snowed in, because we couldn't

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.840 align:middle line:84%
get up the mountain, and
we couldn't get back down.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
I didn't panic.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I knew exactly what I was going
to do if I needed to do it.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was pull over,
make a little bit of heat,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and if we needed
some of the supplies,

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.380 align:middle line:84%
we have them all right
there in the back.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, the universe
sent a big 18-wheeler

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:90%
to plow the way for us.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right in
front of you, huh?

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:90%
He opened up the road for us.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.974 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't die, luckily,
but we came very close.

00:09:48.974 --> 00:09:50.348 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could've
been a mess.

00:09:50.348 --> 00:09:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: It could have, yes.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:84%
But we got married
on December 21, 2012

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:84%
with William Whitecrow, who was
a guest on our show and also

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.690 align:middle line:90%
a longtime friend, as well.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.595 align:middle line:84%
And now he's become
part of our soul family.

00:10:00.595 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's cool.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.417 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:10:02.417 --> 00:10:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Holly Deyo
has written a book

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:90%
called "Dare to Prepare."

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's about survival.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And she talks about earthquakes
that could shut you down.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Hurricanes, tornadoes, inclement
weather and other things

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:90%
that are out there, as well.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:84%
How many Americans do you
think actually prepare?

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Not enough.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's why
MyPatriotSupply was founded.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And we want to make
preparedness something

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:84%
that everybody can afford
and something that everybody

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:84%
is going to enjoy
doing, ultimately.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.485 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a difference
between surviving and thriving.

00:10:39.485 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: You can survive
by eating cockroaches.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.349 align:middle line:90%
You can survive by eating grass.

00:10:45.349 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ugh.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Right.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But is that the way you
really want to survive?

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Or do you want to thrive?

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
It really comes down
to the individual.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to be put in an
animalistic type of mentality

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:84%
when you are searching
for food and you're

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.150 align:middle line:90%
willing to do whatever it takes?

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.472 align:middle line:84%
Or do you want to retain
a little bit of humanity

00:11:02.472 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:90%
and say, you know what?

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I have enough to
take care of me.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to resort to
those kind of extremes.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And I keep bringing
up Black Friday

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:90%
because it's very important.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:84%
If we see people
willing to do that

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:84%
on Black Friday for
plastic garbage,

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:84%
they'll be willing to do
it 10 times worse for food.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what it comes down to.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So not enough
people are prepared.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy
to start preparing.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But again, it goes right back
to that preparedness mentality.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:84%
First, you have to formulate
a plan within your mind,

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and then start to acquire some
of the skills and the products

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:90%
or supplies in order to do so.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I'm not
prepared for the big problem,

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:40.810 align:middle line:90%
like you are.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.840 align:middle line:84%
But I'm prepared
for the short term--

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:84%
72 hours to maybe a week--
I've got enough stored away

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and enough supplies
to take care of myself

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:90%
and the people I care about.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And if anything goes
down, George, don't worry.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.424 align:middle line:84%
You are welcome
with us at any time.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but
I'll be in St. Louis,

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be god
knows where, right?

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.383 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: That is true.

00:12:00.383 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And nobody will know
where I am, either.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:90%
That's key.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.000 align:middle line:90%
That's key.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.425 align:middle line:84%
When you prepare, you can't
talk about your supplies.

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:07.300 align:middle line:90%
Don't make it public.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Don't do all of that.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.516 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, somebody
will want that.

00:12:09.516 --> 00:12:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:84%
When I speak, I speak very
vaguely about what we have.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.112 align:middle line:84%
And I do that on
purpose, because you're

00:12:15.112 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:90%
absolutely right.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.278 align:middle line:84%
You want to make
sure that you take

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
care of your family
and yourself.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
precious metals?

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Precious metals, I
think, is a great investment.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.380 align:middle line:84%
We've seen gold and the
manipulating of currency

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:84%
throughout our time
through paper money.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.087 align:middle line:84%
Gold is the one thing
that has stayed constant

00:12:32.087 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:90%
It's dropped in price lately.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.286 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: It has, a little bit.

00:12:35.286 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:84%
But I remember when
it was $200 and ounce,

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.895 align:middle line:84%
and people were saying it's
going to go up to 1,200, 1,500.

00:12:40.895 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's when we
should have bought everything.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Silver's a
good buy right now.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But our economy is held
by a needle and a thread.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's all at the whim
of a small group of people

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.315 align:middle line:90%
who control the money supply.

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: The Great
Depression, for instance--

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.470 align:middle line:84%
what they did is they
inflated the money

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:84%
supply around 1914
by almost 100%.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Then, in about 1920,
around that time,

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.579 align:middle line:90%
they deflated the money supply.

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden,
everybody was broke

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and there wasn't enough to pay
back the loans and all of this.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that caused a
small economic crisis.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.284 align:middle line:84%
They did it again a
couple years later.

00:13:18.284 --> 00:13:19.700 align:middle line:84%
The first one was
just a test run.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:84%
The second time
they did it, that's

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.050 align:middle line:84%
when it really
started bringing down

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
banks and all of
the corporations.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:10%
And people-- the big
stock market gurus

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:10%
were able to emerge
the rulers of everybody

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:10%
because they purposely
crafted and manipulated

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.500 align:middle line:10%
the whole situation.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.732 align:middle line:84%
There was a loan called a margin
loan, which you can control--

00:13:41.732 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You borrow off some.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yeah.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:84%
You can control
100% of the stock

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:90%
for 10%-- a 10% investment.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So they recalled all of
these margin loans while

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:84%
at the same time deflating the
currency instead of inflating

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:84%
it, which could have helped out
the situation, which ultimately

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.610 align:middle line:84%
led to the biggest economic
crash in our history, which

00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:90%
was the Great Depression.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do we see
in recent history?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:10%
We see the housing bubble, the
adjustable-rate mortgages--

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:10%
the exact same
scenario where they're

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:10%
making the loans so big and so
high because of interest rates

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.839 align:middle line:10%
that there simply isn't
enough money supply

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:10%
to go around to pay
all of this back.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
doing it again.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Yes, which is basically
like playing musical chairs.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's going to
be left stuck out.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we have five
pieces of paper on the table.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.442 align:middle line:90%
And you owe me six.

00:14:25.442 --> 00:14:27.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be able
to pay me back those six,

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.120 align:middle line:90%
so I take your cup.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the game that
they're playing right now

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:84%
with the real estate, the
corporations, the banks.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And they've been doing this
for the last 100 years.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.091 align:middle line:84%
And people just don't
know their history.

00:14:38.091 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:10%
If we just understood
history, and we understood

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:10%
how this money
works, then we would

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.210 align:middle line:10%
understand what is to come.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:10%
So an economic crash
is very, very real.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Gold is a safe
investment, but again, I

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.492 align:middle line:84%
start to question what
gives gold its value?

00:14:50.492 --> 00:14:51.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a good energy conductor.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And we, as people, give
it a value to trade, but--

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that'll
be around for a while.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: --gold is gold.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.234 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:59.234 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel
right now, at this point,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that people just
are fed up, simply

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
saying we're not going
to take it anymore.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Absolutely.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm right there with them.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, there's
not enough of us doing it,

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.069 align:middle line:84%
but there is quite a
bit of us doing it.

00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I think what's going
on with our society is

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that everybody's
drowning in apathy.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And you have the majority of
people who are essentially

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.474 align:middle line:90%
awake in one regard or another.

00:15:24.474 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:84%
They understand
there's a problem.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.230 align:middle line:84%
They understand where the
problem's coming from.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But we have these large media
outlets-- "American Idol"

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and all of this-- that is
not only distracting people,

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.780 align:middle line:84%
but most people will
look at their neighbor

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.071 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, what does he know?

00:15:38.071 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And sporting events.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.516 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Sporting events, yes.

00:15:40.516 --> 00:15:41.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest one, as well.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody is
aware, but everybody

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.247 align:middle line:84%
thinks that the other
person is a sheep,

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better term.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I hate using that
word, because I

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.928 align:middle line:84%
don't want to call
anybody a sheep.

00:15:50.928 --> 00:15:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But let's just-- for lack of a
better term, sheeple mentality.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks
that nobody's awake,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.579 align:middle line:90%
and so everybody feels alone.

00:15:57.579 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why it's so
important for shows like yours

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
to get out there and show
people you're not alone.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.725 align:middle line:84%
You're not alone when
you're preparing.

00:16:04.725 --> 00:16:06.350 align:middle line:84%
There's other people
who are preparing.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everybody's in it.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everybody's in it.

00:16:08.805 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I think sporting events
are brilliant for pacifying

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.340 align:middle line:90%
the public's mentality.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.360 align:middle line:84%
They literally have
captured-- in every city,

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.940 align:middle line:90%
they have dumbed people down.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that
in a disrespectful way.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:84%
But they have
calmed people down--

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that's probably
a better phrase--

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
from being uptight
and concentrating

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:90%
on their own problems and ills.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Sporting events get people to
talk about something totally

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:90%
unrelated to their own life.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest marketing
diversion I've ever seen.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: It comes from the Romans.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:45.301 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:16:45.301 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Bred in circuses.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:46.853 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's why they did it.

00:16:46.853 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Mhm.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rather than have riots
an uprisings, let's have games!

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's bring people in.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Absolutely.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And then people are distracted
from all the economic problems,

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and the wars, and
everything that's going on.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.251 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
the games are over,

00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:00.350 align:middle line:84%
they go out and
talk about the game.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And it just goes
on and on and on.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:90%
The Greeks did the same thing.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.839 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:84%
I'm guilty of the
cute kitty videos.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:90%
I love those.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.859 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain those.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Oh, the
cute kitty videos?

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.631 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Just cute
kittens on YouTube.

00:17:13.631 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, those
kinds of things.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought it was
a toy you buy or something.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, that's Hello Kitty.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yeah.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.688 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, I'm talking
about the cute kitties.

00:17:21.688 --> 00:17:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
to take a step back

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.894 align:middle line:90%
and to actually enjoy your life.

00:17:26.894 --> 00:17:28.726 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have a
little bit of balance.

00:17:28.726 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what I've learned.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.244 align:middle line:84%
You can't just focus on
preparedness 24 hours a day.

00:17:32.244 --> 00:17:34.160 align:middle line:84%
You can't focus on the
economy 24 hours a day.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
You have to enjoy your
life, because if you're not

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:90%
enjoying it, what are you doing?

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:38.120 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody
needs a diversion.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everybody.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: That's my point, exactly.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.463 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, I
see road rage right now

00:17:43.463 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:90%
at an all-time high.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my son sent me a little
message a couple days ago.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, Dad, you're not
going to believe this,

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
but an 80-year-old woman
just gave me the bird

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.730 align:middle line:84%
because she thought he--
either he wasn't letting her in

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:90%
or I don't know what.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:90%
But that's weird.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are so uptight
about everything these days.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I think it comes down to
a couple of different things.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.570 align:middle line:90%
First, the apathy.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.234 align:middle line:84%
But that comes from
this electronic society

00:18:15.234 --> 00:18:17.150 align:middle line:84%
that we have-- social
media-- going right back

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:84%
to what you talked
about a minute ago.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It has desensitized a
lot of people to the fact

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that on the other
side of that keyboard,

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:90%
there's actually a human being.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen the worst
rhetoric coming out

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.677 align:middle line:90%
of people on Facebook.

00:18:29.677 --> 00:18:30.926 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hate-- hate, hate--

00:18:30.926 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Extremely.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think to myself, if this
is the way people really are,

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:90%
then what a society we have.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
But what it really is is that
they've disconnected the fact

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:84%
that there's actually
a real person there.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.994 align:middle line:84%
That carries over into
day-to-day society.

00:18:44.994 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you have
these situations where

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to get
over, and this guy wants

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.725 align:middle line:84%
to go in front of you,
and then flips you off

00:18:50.725 --> 00:18:52.450 align:middle line:90%
as if you did something wrong.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But we also have the
pharmaceutical industry,

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
which has hopped up
everybody on antidepressants

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and given them an inability
to be able to feel.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.475 align:middle line:84%
And we have to feel what's
going on in this world

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.050 align:middle line:90%
at this particular time.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And as a Native American, or
half-Native American myself,

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.280 align:middle line:84%
I realize that there is a
connection to this Earth

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:90%
that we need to feel.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And when the Earth is
struggling and suffering,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:84%
we need to feel that, because
that's what causes us to act.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.025 align:middle line:90%
But people are numb to that.

00:19:18.025 --> 00:19:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're numbing
themselves to that.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.746 align:middle line:84%
And I've even spoken
to people, individuals,

00:19:21.746 --> 00:19:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell them, can't
you feel what's going on?

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I did, but these pills
make me not be able to feel.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, we need to feel.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but I'm sad all the time.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Why are you sad all the time?

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, could it be because the
economy is in just shambles,

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:84%
we're killing people en masse
all over the Middle East.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Here in the United
States, everything

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:84%
is just upside down
and on its head.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Why are we numbing
ourselves from this?

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:90%
We need to feel.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.724 align:middle line:84%
And being able to feel will also
lead to being able to prepare.

00:19:50.724 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With what you're
doing with Truth Frequency

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Radio-- you want
answers, I want answers.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that the
answers are easy to come?

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Or are they
difficult these days?

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I find that when you
put your intuition into it

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and your heart is
in the right place,

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
then you will find the
answers that you're seeking.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But you have to remove
your biases from it.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I have a situation
in my childhood

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.270 align:middle line:84%
where I believed at
some point in time--

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and it could very well be true--
that little gray beings were

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.360 align:middle line:90%
coming into my room.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about little gray beings

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You may be right.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: But because
of those experiences,

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:90%
I want to see an alien.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.750 align:middle line:90%
I want to see a UFO.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So when I see
something in the sky,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:84%
I have to be that
much more skeptical

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.119 align:middle line:84%
because I have a true sense
to want to believe in it.

00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how
we have to approach

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:90%
all situations, in my opinion.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we want
to find the truth,

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.640 align:middle line:84%
we remove ourselves
from all biases

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:90%
and look with clear eyes.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So with survival,
would you buy a gun?

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Absolutely.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:56.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
that most dictators do

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.860 align:middle line:90%
is disarm the population.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important for
each American to be armed.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:90%
We were given--

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And well-trained.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.036 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: And
well-trained to use it.

00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's key right there.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And put it away and hope that
you never have to use it.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the
bottom line is, Chris--

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'm convinced of this-- that
the bad guys will have a gun.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.910 align:middle line:90%
They'll find a gun.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:84%
If they outlaw guns, and
you're not allowed to have one,

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not allowed to
have one, and Ellie,

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.550 align:middle line:84%
who's behind our camera, is
not allowed to have one--

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:90%
the bad guys will have them.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Absolutely.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Look at the war on drugs.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
What has happened as a
result of the war on drugs?

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Did it eliminate drugs?

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:36.576 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:21:36.576 --> 00:21:38.033 align:middle line:84%
It just created a
criminal element.

00:21:38.033 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And now the criminals are the
ones who are getting the drugs.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:84%
They're going to do
the exact same thing.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.540 align:middle line:84%
They don't care
what the law says.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
If they cared what
the law says, they

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't kill people
to begin with,

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.703 align:middle line:84%
because it's against
the law to kill people.

00:21:47.703 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're dealing with
a criminal mind here.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:90%
And they will get guns.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a question
of, do you want

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:84%
to have a gun,
also, in the event

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
that you need one against
one of these criminal-minded

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:84%
individuals, whether they
be a member of the public

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.540 align:middle line:90%
or a member of the government?

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we are
seeing more and more police

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.770 align:middle line:90%
brutality and violence.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
China and Russia

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and all of these tyrannical
governments of past

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:84%
come right here in
the United States.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to get
a gun in Russia

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:84%
than it is in the
United States now.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.710 align:middle line:84%
They just did a
recent study on that.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Canada just
had an episode there.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And though their gun laws
are different than ours,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:84%
I bet every Canadian wishes
that they were armed.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Mhm.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Right, absolutely.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You take away
guns from a society,

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:90%
you've entrapped them.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.541 align:middle line:90%
You really have.

00:22:32.541 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Absolutely.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.581 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's all about.

00:22:34.581 --> 00:22:36.740 align:middle line:84%
It's about bringing down
this element of control

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:90%
so we can't fight back.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what they
did in Hurricane Katrina.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.342 align:middle line:10%
They disarmed the population
first and foremost,

00:22:45.342 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:10%
and then they wouldn't
let anybody leave.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.260 align:middle line:10%
And when they tried
to leave, what

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.284 align:middle line:10%
was our government
doing to those people?

00:22:51.284 --> 00:22:53.825 align:middle line:84%
They were shooting them on the
bridge, George-- shooting them

00:22:53.825 --> 00:22:55.575 align:middle line:84%
in the back while these
people were trying

00:22:55.575 --> 00:22:57.770 align:middle line:84%
to get to a place that
was safe with food,

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:90%
with water, et cetera.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.187 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to believe
that our own government would

00:23:02.187 --> 00:23:04.770 align:middle line:84%
do this, but they actually put
these police officers on trial,

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:08.040 align:middle line:84%
found them guilty, and just
recently, from what I've

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.590 align:middle line:84%
read in the recent
week, they have actually

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:90%
gotten off on appeal.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So what does that tell
you about our government?

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.912 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you for sure that
our police force is not tasked--

00:23:17.912 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But not all of them.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Not all of them.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Not all of them, no.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: But our police force is
not tasked with your safety.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:84%
There was a Supreme Court case
that went to the Supreme Court

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:84%
because the police
failed to keep them safe.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And the Supreme
Court said, it's not

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:84%
the police's job
to keep you safe.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
to keep yourself safe.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So why would it be FEMA's job
to come in and take care of you

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
in the event of a
disaster if it's not

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:84%
the police department's
job to keep you safe?

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
It keeps on going back to that
over and over and over again.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.440 align:middle line:84%
The government is not
there for your benefit.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can even look at the
rhetoric coming out of FEMA

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.798 align:middle line:84%
and out of the federal
government, because they

00:23:55.798 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:90%
have been saying, prepare.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Prepare.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to help you.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Prepare.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But what do they know?

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.874 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:01.874 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And we can only
speculate on that,

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it's as Ed
Dames talks about,

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.877 align:middle line:84%
"Killshot," or the
passing of Nibiru.

00:24:08.877 --> 00:24:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And again, these are
out-there topics.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is it true
they're buying body bags?

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.928 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I have heard
that, that they

00:24:13.928 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
are buying large
amounts of body bags.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I haven't found any
evidence to prove that 100%,

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:84%
but the sources that
I have heard this from

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.940 align:middle line:90%
are very reliable.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't
surprise me at all.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.550 align:middle line:84%
There was a story about FEMA
coffins, and as it turns out,

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.990 align:middle line:90%
these were coffin liners.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.752 align:middle line:84%
So I take that
story and put that

00:24:30.752 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:90%
in a whole different category.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that-- I
want to say last year,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:84%
they sent out an email to
all the survival companies--

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.779 align:middle line:84%
FEMA did-- and they
were looking to buy

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:42.195 align:middle line:84%
as much storable
food as possible.

00:24:42.195 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of everything.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:90%
And as quickly as possible.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:84%
So they were preparing
for an event--

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.484 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe to help us?

00:24:48.484 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Possibly.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.441 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or to help themselves?

00:24:50.441 --> 00:24:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Possibly.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Again, we can only speculate.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.520 align:middle line:84%
But I did speak
to FEMA first-hand

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:84%
myself-- the FEMA
representative.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And I found him to be a
sincere gentleman, a sincere

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.240 align:middle line:90%
individual.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And he really believed in
what he was talking about.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So he gave me several
different scenarios

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:90%
of what they're preparing for.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.240 align:middle line:84%
One, an attack on an
International Airport.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Two, an event that
would take out

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.140 align:middle line:84%
an entire tri-state area--
three different states.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.890 align:middle line:90%
And he gave me situations.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:19.480 align:middle line:90%
It could be--

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.979 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a
power grid take-out?

00:25:20.979 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: He didn't say.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:90%
He said it could be pandemic.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:84%
It could be an attack
from another country.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.740 align:middle line:90%
It could be an EMP.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.084 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything.

00:25:30.084 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Mother Nature.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.124 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Mother Nature.

00:25:32.124 --> 00:25:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But he was talking,
and he was speaking

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.964 align:middle line:84%
in numbers of 14
million people dead

00:25:36.964 --> 00:25:38.130 align:middle line:90%
and three million surviving.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.520 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to take care
of those three million people?

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.478 align:middle line:84%
So he was speaking in
very, very large numbers.

00:25:42.478 --> 00:25:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but isn't
that smart to do that?

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.740 align:middle line:84%
That's preparing like
we've been talking

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.740 align:middle line:90%
about for this last half hour.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:84%
For government to
be able to say,

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.770 align:middle line:84%
God forbid, but if
something happens,

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.600 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to be short
like we were during Katrina.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.170 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be ready.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I would say so, but when
they prepare for something,

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:84%
it's because they know
something's coming.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:84%
On the radio show, Truth
Frequency, in May of 2012,

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I told the listeners,
be prepared

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.039 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to see,
throughout the entire summer,

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:15.830 align:middle line:84%
maybe even throughout
the entire next year,

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.295 align:middle line:84%
school shootings and
shootings at movie theaters.

00:26:18.295 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And look what happened.

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: It's not
because I'm a prophet.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.570 align:middle line:84%
It's because I know how
to read their documents.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.790 align:middle line:84%
They did an operation
right here in Denver

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:84%
called Operation
Mountain Guardian.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And in this operation, they were
practicing for school shootings

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:90%
and shootings in movie theaters.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.380 align:middle line:84%
So when they start
practicing all the scenarios,

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.088 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to see that
those scenarios are

00:26:36.088 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:90%
about to come live.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, we had a
whole year of shooting

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:84%
after shooting, after
shooting, after shooting--

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:90%
exact same scenarios.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So when FEMA's
preparing for something,

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.492 align:middle line:84%
I like to take that same
mentality and say OK, wait.

00:26:48.492 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
If they're preparing
for something,

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:84%
then they know something is
coming, whether they have

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
created, or elements
within our government

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.900 align:middle line:84%
have actually created
the situations,

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
or they just know
something's coming-- pole

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.720 align:middle line:90%
shift, for instance.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the polar ice
caps have melted

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and it can create
a mini ice age.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.430 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
different scenarios,

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.790 align:middle line:84%
but the most important
thing is to prepare.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, we've just
passed another anniversary

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:84%
of the assassination
of John F Kennedy.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Will we ever, as Americans,
find out what happened?

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: I think we have, George.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
so many great researchers

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:84%
out there who've really pointed
to what actually happened.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.856 align:middle line:90%
The same with 9/11, too.

00:27:25.856 --> 00:27:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I keep hearing people saying,
we need a new investigation

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:29.249 align:middle line:90%
for 9/11.

00:27:29.249 --> 00:27:29.790 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:84%
We need accountability for
those who were responsible

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.260 align:middle line:84%
for it, because there
have been so many--

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We know what happened.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now we've
got to find out who.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Exactly.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:84%
But we're never going to
hear it from the government.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.709 align:middle line:84%
The government's never going
to come out and say, well, yes,

00:27:39.709 --> 00:27:40.970 align:middle line:90%
it was the CIA responsible.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.928 align:middle line:84%
And they were in league
with the oil companies,

00:27:42.928 --> 00:27:44.350 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.110 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, they killed JFK.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:90%
It's never going to happen.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Country was
never the same after that.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: No.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think you
were born then, were you?

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.428 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: I was not, but--

00:27:53.428 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was 13.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.527 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: From my research, that
was the last American president

00:27:57.527 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that actually had
any kind of control.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.193 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you born
when we landed on the moon?

00:28:01.193 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: No.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:02.030 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, you've missed
all these great events.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.636 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I have, but
I was here for 9/11.

00:28:06.636 --> 00:28:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yes.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:08.320 align:middle line:90%
And that was--

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'll
never forget that.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:10.663 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: I will never forget that.

00:28:10.663 --> 00:28:12.070 align:middle line:90%
I remember exactly where I was.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But you know what's
scary, George?

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:18.194 align:middle line:84%
Is that our children, some
of them are here after 9/11.

00:28:18.194 --> 00:28:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of them don't
understand what

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.349 align:middle line:84%
it's like to go to school
without cameras, without having

00:28:22.349 --> 00:28:23.640 align:middle line:90%
to go through a metal detector.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.681 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember when you
could get on an airplane

00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:27.180 align:middle line:84%
and just walk in
and pay some cash?

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.388 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those days are gone.

00:28:28.388 --> 00:28:31.020 align:middle line:84%
But I gotta tell you,
they don't bother me.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm used to it now.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And if it ensures safety,
so that one wacko doesn't

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.880 align:middle line:84%
have a box cutter or
something like that,

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.970 align:middle line:90%
I'll go through that now.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we've lost some rights.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:90%
We've given up a little privacy.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:46.360 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So I take my shoes off and
they look at my liquids.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I feel a little more
secure on a plane.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: "Those who are willing to
sacrifice freedom for security

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.127 align:middle line:90%
shall receive neither."

00:28:57.127 --> 00:28:58.710 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
Founding Fathers--

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.437 align:middle line:90%
I want to say Benjamin Franklin.

00:29:00.437 --> 00:29:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is Franklin.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.129 align:middle line:84%
But it's not freedom
that I gave up.

00:29:03.129 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: It is a little
bit of freedom.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's just
kind of smarts

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:84%
to make sure
somebody's not carrying

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.960 align:middle line:90%
some kind of liquid bomb aboard.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: Yeah, but--

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't you feel
a little more secure

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:90%
when you're on a plane?

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: No.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I get very insulted when I
am treated like a criminal,

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.810 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not a criminal.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we
know you're not.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GEO: See?

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:17.240 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I'm not.

00:29:18.115 --> 00:29:20.350 align:middle line:84%
But don't you feel
good that you know

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:90%
that plane's probably secure.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: I don't know it's any
more secure than it was prior

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:84%
to 9/11, before all
these screenings,

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.230 align:middle line:84%
because the TSA really
hasn't found anything.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Judge Napolitano, as
a matter of fact-- he,

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:40.180 align:middle line:84%
from my understanding, was
dismissed from Fox News

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.510 align:middle line:84%
or CNN-- I don't remember
which outlet he worked for--

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:43.676 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think it was Fox.

00:29:43.676 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: Fox, yes-- because he did
a report that 33 out of the 34

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.620 align:middle line:84%
terror plots that
the FBI had foiled

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.830 align:middle line:84%
were actually created
by the FBI themselves.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:58.550 align:middle line:10%
So we see a situation to
where the only thing that TSA

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.410 align:middle line:10%
has ever done is,
number one, steal

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:04.680 align:middle line:10%
people's personal belongings,
but number two, actually

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.250 align:middle line:10%
busted supposed
terrorists and hijackers

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.592 align:middle line:10%
who were actually FBI
moles and informants.

00:30:10.592 --> 00:30:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, people
want to track you.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.210 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.715 align:middle line:84%
>>GEO: TruthFrequencyRadio.com
and MyPatriotSupply.com.

00:30:15.715 --> 00:30:16.673 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've got it.

00:30:16.673 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Survival.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Just be ready.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:24.940 align:middle line:10%
Who knows when or how,
but it will happen.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.900 align:middle line:10%
So just be ready.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."
