>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.248 align:middle line:10%
You know, I can't
think of a subject that

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:25.080 align:middle line:10%
is more dear to my heart
than monsters, creatures.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to know
about these things.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest
on Beyond Belief

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:90%
today is an expert on monsters.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>A series of Bigfoot sightings
in the small town of Minerva,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Ohio, captured the nation's
attention some 40 years ago.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Since then, it has been
a largely forgotten.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But Minerva's
monster has returned

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:84%
to the spotlight once again,
thanks to documentary filmmaker

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Seth Breedlove.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:84%
It is the first in his series,
"Small Town Monsters," which

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:84%
explores lost and bizarre
history around the United

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Seth's second film, called
"The Beast of Whitehall,"

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
examines another odd case
that occurred in New York

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.740 align:middle line:90%
in the late 1970s.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:10%
Seth, who also hosts a Bigfoot
podcast called "SasWhat,"

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:10%
discusses the filmmaking
process and explains

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:10%
why the few cases
they've highlighted

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:10%
stand out from
typical sightings.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Today, on Beyond Belief.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Seth, what an
exciting career you've got.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.182 align:middle line:10%
At such a young age, too.

00:01:30.182 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SETH BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.310 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
someone beforehand

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.620 align:middle line:84%
about the breadth of things that
I've done in addition to this.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.536 align:middle line:10%
Just random things, like tiling
floors and repossessing homes

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:10%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But now I make
movies about Bigfoot.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So how to go from one to the
other is difficult to track.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:84%
But I think somewhere in there
I became a newspaper journalist,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and that helped feed into
documentary filmmaking.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I've always loved
film especially,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
but that kind of fit
with my love of Bigfoot

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and the things all
came together for me.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Seth,
with the varied career

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
that you've had, how did you
turn that journalism career

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.520 align:middle line:90%
into investigating monsters?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: I started getting
into the Bigfoot subject

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:90%
in the early 2000s.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And there was actually a
series of unusual events

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
that happened in the town
that I had grown up in.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
There were deer being found on
the outskirts of town actually

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:84%
ripped in half, hides ripped
out, that kind of thing,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:84%
stuffed up in trees at about
heights of 8 to 10 feet.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
learning about Bigfoot,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.902 align:middle line:84%
and that was the first thing
I investigated on my own.

00:02:39.902 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And my version of
investigating was

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:84%
to go down and talk to locals
about what they had seen

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.460 align:middle line:90%
or if they had seen anything.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And that fed into
my desire to write

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
a book on these small
town monster cases.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Kind of cases where
a creature comes

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
into a community or a scene
in or around a community,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and it impacts the
culture of that community.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.939 align:middle line:84%
Not just a bunch of
people see an unusual--

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Economically
and otherwise, right?

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah, everything.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Psychologically, how it
impacts the local folklore.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:84%
How the people that are involved
in the sighting react to it

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:90%
and how the town reacts to them.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:90%
All that kind of stuff.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And I actually put this
together originally as a book

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
proposal, because I'm more of
a writer, I've always thought.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.020 align:middle line:84%
But I love filmmaking,
and when I was a kid,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.392 align:middle line:90%
I was a giant film geek.

00:03:24.392 --> 00:03:26.475 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all I did was sit
around and watch movies,

00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:90%
and I weighed like 300 pounds.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:10%
That was all I did was sit and--

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did you really?

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.901 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah, I did.

00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:33.470 align:middle line:10%
That was all I did
was watch movies.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But I gave up on that
dream, and then somehow it

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
came back around when the book
project, for the most part,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
was turned down by
most of the publishers.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to a
couple friends of mine

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.300 align:middle line:84%
who were-- they had the
equipment necessary to make

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.100 align:middle line:90%
a movie.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you guys want to
just do this as a film project?

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's set out.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's do one movie about
the Minerva monster, which

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
was our local monster, and then
see where it goes from there.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the whole
impetus for everything.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:90%
But it all fed together.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.690 align:middle line:84%
The things that I had some
knowledge of helped it.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about
monsters that people just love?

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.757 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: It's
the idea, for me.

00:04:13.757 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is
for a lot of people.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that there could
be these undiscovered creatures

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:90%
living in your own backyard.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.909 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with a huge forest
behind my parents' house,

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and we played in the woods
all the time as a kid.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
the idea that hey,

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:84%
you know what, there's a
monster somewhere here.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:90%
There's always-- you were told--

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lurking somewhere.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.334 align:middle line:84%
We were always
telling each other

00:04:34.334 --> 00:04:36.330 align:middle line:84%
these stories about
the Bolivar monster,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.340 align:middle line:84%
or whatever your monster
is, your local monster.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:90%
And every town has a monster.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.760 align:middle line:90%
I always say that.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Every town has one.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.640 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's the idea of--

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whether it's a
human or otherwise, right?

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right, right.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
it is a human being.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And we've been
discussing that too,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
how wide-spanning the very
idea of small town monsters is.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't just have to
cryptids, it could be anything.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.781 align:middle line:84%
Your local monster can be a
serial killer or someone that--

00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exactly right.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.240 align:middle line:10%
Who terrorizes a community.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:10%
And every town has one.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you found
that these small cities

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
like the notoriety that these
creatures bring the town?

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: If they're smart.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.647 align:middle line:84%
That's the difficult
thing about it.

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:84%
A lot of towns shy away
from it because they

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle line:90%
find it kind of embarrassing.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:90%
They're a local monster.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to embrace
that because it will

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:90%
make them a laughing stock.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:90%
That's how they think.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Or they're worried about
how people perceive it.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.360 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Minerva,
back in the '70s,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:84%
when the case originally broke,
they were concerned about that.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Today, they see that
as a great opportunity

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
to bring in advertising,
tourism, all that.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And the same situation has
happened with Whitehall

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:90%
in New York.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.960 align:middle line:84%
They're finally embracing
their local monster,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:84%
even though back in the
'70s it was a laughingstock,

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and they avoided
it at all costs.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Today they've got a
statue in the town.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.929 align:middle line:90%
And if you're--

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like Rocky.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.570 align:middle line:10%
And if you're smart
about it, you'll

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.876 align:middle line:10%
make that a centerpiece
for the town.

00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Especially these
small towns that

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:84%
are hurting from the
economy and all that.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your very first film
was "Minerva." "The Minerva

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Monster."

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.772 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:90%

>>It was August of 1978.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Our shift started at 10:30, and
as I left the Sheriff's office

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:84%
to head out into my area, I
got a call to go to a house

on Lincoln Street East,
which is Route 30, US 30.

And when I got out of the
car and met the people

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:84%
at the house, who were obviously
distressed, what they described

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.744 align:middle line:84%
to me was hearing
rocks or something

00:07:00.744 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:90%
hit the roof of their house.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.201 align:middle line:84%
>>When we first started seeing
it, it was, I would say,

00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:90%
between six and seven foot tall.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.806 align:middle line:90%
Covered in hair.

00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:90%
It still had facial features.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.963 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't completely
like a rag mop, you know,

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:12.232 align:middle line:90%
over the face and everything.

00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
But it probably weighed a good
400 to 500 pounds, I'd say.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Maybe more.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Muscular.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.434 align:middle line:84%
Because you could
see, it wasn't like--

00:07:22.434 --> 00:07:44.232 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.232 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seth, when
you were interviewing

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:84%
these people for the
Minerva Monster documentary,

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.026 align:middle line:90%
did you believe them?

00:07:51.026 --> 00:07:51.942 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Oh, yeah.

00:07:51.942 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.660 align:middle line:84%
With these cases,
especially Minerva,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with people
who never really stood

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.340 align:middle line:84%
to gain anything
from their encounter

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and from coming forward
with their encounter.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:84%
The Cayton family,
especially, they

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.289 align:middle line:84%
were ridiculed horribly by
the town and the community.

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They didn't want that.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: They
didn't want any of that.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or deserve it.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.130 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:10%
Or deserve it.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
people in the movie.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.520 align:middle line:84%
We interviewed a lot of
people from the community

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:90%
around there.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
I think we have four or
five other people that

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:84%
claimed to see the creature
around the same time

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:90%
and up to today.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And for the most part, when
a witness comes forward

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.759 align:middle line:84%
to talk about their case,
it's not a situation

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:84%
where they're begging
me to come on camera.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I typically have to beg
them to talk to me about it.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And with the Minerva case,
especially with the Cayton

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:84%
family, they'd
never gone on camera

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:90%
to talk about their case.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:84%
They'd been offered deals
with television shows

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:90%
to talk about it.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
They'd had people coaxing on
them to come on television.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
It took me about three months
of working with the Caytons

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:90%
to get Howie to come on camera.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.175 align:middle line:90%
He never spoke of it.

00:08:53.175 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To build up
that confidence, right?

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: Well, I'm sure
you've done that yourself.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.440 align:middle line:10%
You have to build that kind of
relationship with a witness.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.270 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the ones that
want to come on quickly--

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: You worry about.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You worry about.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.105 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:09:04.105 --> 00:09:04.905 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:09:04.905 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And with the Caytons, I
never had that impression

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
that we really want to pull
something over on someone.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.420 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing
to gain from it.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And their story
is so fascinating.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's not overblown.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Or like, sometimes you
read these stories,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.322 align:middle line:84%
and there was a Bigfoot
ripping apart their house,

00:09:22.322 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And there are very dramatic
elements to Cayton's story.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that
they didn't want this.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:90%
They didn't ask for it.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:90%
And that fascinates me.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.561 align:middle line:84%
And then things like the
local law enforcement

00:09:35.561 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:84%
officers, who especially
have nothing to gain from it.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Because typically, law
enforcement officers

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that come forward
with their sightings

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:90%
are a subject of ridicule.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet
they're all baffled.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And so for us, on both of
the films we've done so far,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.260 align:middle line:84%
we've had law enforcement
officials that were involved.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And especially with them, I'm
very drawn to those cases,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:84%
because they're trained
in the art of observation.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What can you tell
us about the Minerva monster?

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: It was a case
that happened in 1978.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was basically
interacting with this one

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.050 align:middle line:90%
particular family.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:84%
The creature was said to be this
upright-walking, hair-covered

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.880 align:middle line:90%
monster.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.892 align:middle line:84%
Seven feet tall, glowing
orange eyes or red eyes,

00:10:14.892 --> 00:10:16.350 align:middle line:84%
depending on who
you're talking to.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is a great
Bigfoot description.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is this
thing is covered in hair.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
sounds like Bigfoot,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
but when I say it's
covered in hair,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.002 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's almost like a rag
mop, is how Howie described it.

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:84%
To the point where
you could hardly

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.762 align:middle line:90%
make out facial features.

00:10:30.762 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here and everywhere.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.401 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ape-like almost.

00:10:33.401 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: Very
ape-like, yeah.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So they were seeing
this creature

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:90%
a lot behind their house.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, it
actually-- it appears

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:90%
that it attacked their dog.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Their dog one night was barking
ferociously, nonstop all night.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
They came out in the
morning, and the dog

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:84%
had been ripped
out of its collar

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:90%
and its neck had been snapped.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: So
they also discovered

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.510 align:middle line:84%
that the dog had dug a seven
foot tunnel under its house,

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:84%
wide enough for two animals,
that it had obviously

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:84%
been hiding in whenever
whatever was terrifying it

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:90%
had been coming around.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The dog did this?

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.950 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: The dog had dug
this tunnel under its house--

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: To get away.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.630 align:middle line:10%
To hide under.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:10%
So something had obviously
terrified the dog.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we discovered
during the making of the film

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
is that this wasn't
only during 1978.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
The original "Akron
Beacon Journal" story

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.070 align:middle line:90%
started running in 1978.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:84%
But there had been
a history going back

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:84%
decades, in the area, of
unknown creature sightings.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
But with even the
Caytons, they had

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
had a run-in two
years prior, where

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Howie Cayton and
three other boys

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:84%
actually claimed to have
jumped on the creature.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.865 align:middle line:84%
They were walking
around a pond--

00:11:41.865 --> 00:11:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That wasn't smart.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: No. [LAUGHS] They
were walking around a pond.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:84%
They claimed to see
it down in this gully,

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and they jumped on it.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And it threw one of them off
and bit one of them on the back.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- it was
an ongoing case.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Once the case broke, it reached
the "Akron Beacon Journal."

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
It ran all across the country
and all these major news media

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.900 align:middle line:84%
outlets and became
a global phenomenon.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Do we know if the
kid who was bitten

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
got infected or
anything like that?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: He claims
to have a scar still

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.874 align:middle line:90%
on his back from the incident.

00:12:11.874 --> 00:12:13.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I would
like to see that.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: So would
I. He was actually

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.410 align:middle line:10%
at one of our
screenings of the film,

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:10%
and he got out before
I could ask him.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.932 align:middle line:10%
But I'm hoping maybe
in the next year

00:12:20.932 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:10%
I can run into him again
and try to get a look at it.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.223 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Would you have
been suspicious had he not

00:12:25.223 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:10%
shown it to you?

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: You know what?

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to blame anyone
for not taking their shirt off.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Or like--

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I had been bitten
by a Bigfoot, I would show you.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:10%
That's kind of the
way I feel about it.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
They also called
the police on that.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:84%
There's police reports connected
with this case as well,

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.720 align:middle line:84%
which is unusual for a
lot of Bigfoot cases.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.914 align:middle line:84%
You can't find this kind
of official documentation.

00:12:46.914 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But with this case,
there's a ton of it.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And then it was also
being documented

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:90%
by all the local papers.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you're still
getting Minerva Bigfoot

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:53.660 align:middle line:90%
sightings?

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.535 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Oh yeah.

00:12:54.535 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:84%
I'd say once or twice a
month I'll get someone.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:84%
But we get-- beyond
modern sightings,

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.270 align:middle line:84%
we get people contacting us who
did see something back in '78

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:90%
or yeah.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.416 align:middle line:10%
And there were--

00:13:07.416 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Then it it might
not be the same creature.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:10%
It may have been an offspring.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.244 align:middle line:84%
And well, that's what's unique
about the Minerva case too,

00:13:15.244 --> 00:13:16.660 align:middle line:84%
is that there were
these sightings

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.080 align:middle line:84%
of two other creatures
accompanying it

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:90%
who are said to be smaller.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.562 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like babies?

00:13:22.562 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Possibly babies.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
What's unusual
about this case is

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.920 align:middle line:84%
that the Caytons claim that
these creatures that they're

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:90%
seeing are cat-like.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Feline.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.500 align:middle line:90%
With tails?

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.651 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: With tails.

00:13:35.651 --> 00:13:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But standing upright.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: Mountain lion,
black mountain lioness,

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.070 align:middle line:90%
panther, cougar.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.153 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Standing upright.

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:41.955 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: No.

00:13:41.955 --> 00:13:42.755 align:middle line:90%
On all fours.

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Quadrupeds.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, there
were other witnesses

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:84%
we talked to who did claim
to see the creature with two

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:90%
smaller ones.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Two juveniles.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.399 align:middle line:84%
So the theory runs--
obviously, everyone

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
wants to concoct their
own theory on this--

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
but my theory is that
possibly these were juveniles.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they move on all fours.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they move hunched forward.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Until they stand up.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was, it's
a really unusual case.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I've never-- I'm not
acquainted with other Bigfoot

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:84%
sighting cases where you've
got a Bigfoot accompanied

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.684 align:middle line:84%
by two other creatures,
especially cats.

00:14:17.684 --> 00:14:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
like to see it?

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Oh, yeah.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would it scare you?

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: It
would terrify me.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Would you run?

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.390 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: I'd-- yeah.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.894 align:middle line:84%
Amongst other--
screaming, running.

00:14:26.894 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe see it in the
car, with the engine running.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Dart across the road
or something like that.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did a documentary
on the Whitehall monster

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.660 align:middle line:90%
as well, right?

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.
"Beast of Whitehall."

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look at
the beast of Whitehall, New

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.110 align:middle line:90%
York.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.990 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>I still dream about this
incident once in a while.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But back then, I relived that
thing day in and day out, night

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:90%
after night.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.241 align:middle line:90%
I would have relive that.

00:14:51.241 --> 00:14:53.037 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one of
the craziest things,

00:14:53.037 --> 00:14:55.245 align:middle line:84%
right to this day, right to
this moment, this second,

00:14:55.245 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
is what the hell
was I looking at.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>It was the talk of the town.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.780 align:middle line:90%
It was the talk of the region.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
It was a big deal when
the '76 case happened.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.480 align:middle line:84%
But we weren't really so
used to hearing reports

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.150 align:middle line:84%
about Big Foot in own backyards,
here in New York state.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>This is when he
detected movement

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.680 align:middle line:90%
along the telephone pole.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:84%
As it passed in
front of the pole,

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
he says it began running towards
Paddock's green pickup truck.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, I couldn't speak at
first, but finally blurted out,

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Marty, get the hell out of here.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
That's when Paddock spun out,
leaving 57 feet of rubber

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.422 align:middle line:90%
as he fishtailed down the road.

00:15:41.422 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.636 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seth, tell us more
about the "Beast of Whitehall."

00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: "Beast
of Whitehall"

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:56.230 align:middle line:84%
is a film about this very famous
Bigfoot case that happened back

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:84%
in 1976, the Whitehall
Creature Case,

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:84%
as it was referred
to in the paper.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.830 align:middle line:84%
The first article that ran about
it referred to it as a beast,

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
and that came from the
kids' accounts, the three

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:90%
boys that were in this truck.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.976 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A great
headline, right?

00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.887 align:middle line:10%
There were a lot of
great headlines connected

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:10%
with this story, which
you would appreciate.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:10%
But there are so
many fascinating ones

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:10%
because there was also this
UFO flap that was taking

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:10%
place synonymous with this.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So there were these two crazy
things occurring simultaneously

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:90%
in Whitehall.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.490 align:middle line:84%
But basically, the film
documents the 1976 Abair

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
incident, which was these
three-- well, actually,

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:84%
two boys were driving down
this isolated dirt road,

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:90%
late at night.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And they had this sighting of
an upright-walking, hair-covered

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:43.590 align:middle line:84%
classic Bigfoot, crossed
the road in front of them.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.690 align:middle line:90%
They turned around.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:90%
They go into town.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:90%
They get a third boy.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
They come back out,
and all three of them

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.872 align:middle line:84%
have a sighting of
this creature again.

00:16:50.872 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, they turn
around to go back to town

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.360 align:middle line:84%
and get one of the kids
father, who was also

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.040 align:middle line:90%
the police chief at the time.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.430 align:middle line:90%
They tell him about the case.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.006 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does he believe it?

00:17:00.006 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE:
Automatically, he does.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.651 align:middle line:84%
Because he also brings
seven other members of law

00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:05.150 align:middle line:90%
enforcement out to the site.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He believed it.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.625 align:middle line:90%
He believed it.

00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:06.425 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So 11 people are
out at the sighting

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:84%
when this happens, and
they all see the creature.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So 11 people, eight of which
are members of law enforcement,

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:84%
proceed to see this
upright-walking, hair-covered

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:90%
monster.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
The most common occurrence,
the thing that people always

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
talk about, are the glowing
red eyes, especially

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:90%
in this Abair case.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:90%
Everyone talks about it.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's different.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't hear a lot about
glowing red eyes on a Bigfoot.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: And just kind
of drawing off of that,

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:84%
there's a long history of
glowing-red-eyed creatures

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.420 align:middle line:90%
in Whitehall, New York.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
There was a sighting
a year prior--

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Panthers.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:84%
A year prior, there was
a sighting by a golf club

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:84%
owner about a mile
from Abair Road.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.528 align:middle line:90%
They claimed to see it.

00:17:47.528 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
We've got that
documented in the film.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And then there's actually
Native American legends

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.640 align:middle line:90%
that also talk about it.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seth, what do you
think of the witnesses,

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and their ability to
describe what they've seen,

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:90%
and their authenticity?

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: With
the Whitehall case,

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:84%
there's eight members
of law enforcement.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of those law
enforcement officials

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:84%
didn't officially come forward
and talk about their case.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.774 align:middle line:84%
Because this was, again,
like with Minerva,

00:18:14.774 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:90%
there was a lot of ridicule.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have to
pull this out of them?

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: With our main
witness, Brian Gosselin,

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:90%
we did.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's for a few
different reasons,

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.438 align:middle line:84%
not just because he doesn't
want the ridicule factor.

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Brian's been telling this
story since it happened.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is,
with Brian, that there's

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:84%
been a long history
of taking his story

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and changing it, or changing
the entire Abair incident.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:10%
So what we set out to
do was to actually tell

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:10%
that story, the Abair
incident, start to finish,

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.670 align:middle line:10%
the way it actually happened.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:10%
And so we were able to do that,
which I'm really proud of.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:54.720 align:middle line:10%
But as far as his ability to
tell his story well and all

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:10%
that, I loved it.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was one
of the best witness

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.010 align:middle line:90%
encounters I've ever heard.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:84%
It actually gave me goosebumps
while he was telling it.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And we were out in the middle
of the field where it happened.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:10%
So that--

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You could feel it.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.500 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.300 align:middle line:90%
You could.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And he started-- he
actually teared up

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.344 align:middle line:84%
towards the end
of his interview.

00:19:08.344 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Emotional?

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.084 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: It's a
really emotional account.

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:84%
We tried to capture
that with the film,

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:90%
the emotion of the story.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Because again,
like with Minerva,

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.930 align:middle line:84%
there's a family at
the center of this.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's the Gosselin family.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It was Brian, his brother,
Paul, who was one of the boys,

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and then their father,
who was the police chief.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.791 align:middle line:84%
And they all three had
their own sightings,

00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and it all impacted their
lives in a major way.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So we tried to
capture that in music

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:84%
that Brandon Dalo composes
for the films, and all that.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.725 align:middle line:84%
Because the psychological
and the emotional impact

00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:41.350 align:middle line:84%
that these stories
have on those people

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.390 align:middle line:84%
is just as important to me as
the monster at the heart of it.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you
see that, you really

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.427 align:middle line:84%
believe this person's
telling the truth.

00:19:48.427 --> 00:19:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right, right.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.060 align:middle line:84%
As far as their
ability to properly

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:84%
give their story and their
observational skills tops.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And we had audiotaped interviews
with those original witnesses,

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:90%
the three boys.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Who one of the boys
has passed away.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.242 align:middle line:90%
Paul passed away.

00:20:06.242 --> 00:20:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the other two
boys don't want anything

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.670 align:middle line:90%
to do with the story anymore.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
But we have audio
taped interviews

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that Bill Brann actually took
prior-- or following the day

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:90%
after that incident.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So we have, from 1976, their
accounts of what happened.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this
echo Minerva at all?

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yes.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, definitely.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:84%
The way it echoes it
though is, like I said,

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:33.380 align:middle line:84%
it's the familial
aspect that draws me in.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.120 align:middle line:84%
But I think the way the
town responded, especially,

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.742 align:middle line:84%
and the way the town has
been impacted by the story.

00:20:39.742 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's got to be huge.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: In a
major way, yeah.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.338 align:middle line:10%
There's people
like-- in our movie,

00:20:43.338 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:10%
we have Paul Bartholomew,
who's a local.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And he grew up
aware of that story.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And because of that
story being so popular

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:84%
in the local folklore,
I think that inspired

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.760 align:middle line:84%
him to become this author and
researcher that he is today.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:84%

not even live in that area

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:90%

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:84%
was to someday do the granddaddy
of all small town monsters.

movie done about this.

>>BREEDLOVE: Right. "The
Legend of Boggy Creek"

00:22:25.478 --> 00:22:28.730 align:middle line:10%
came out in 1972 and
documented these sightings that

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:10%
were happening in and around
the town of Fouke, Arkansas.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Now the sightings in the
movie go back to the '50s.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
history of sightings

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:84%
in and around Arkansas that
go back through the 1800s,

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.050 align:middle line:84%
with wild man sightings, and
the Watchdog Mountain Range,

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and obviously, there's
sightings from all over.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that always
draws me to these stories

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.270 align:middle line:84%
is the newspaper
historical accounts.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So I did my own
research into these.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those are the best.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I did my own research and
was able to uncover stories

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:90%
from the late 1800s.

A lot of stories

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:84%

just that Legend of Boggy Creek

what's going on today.

after the movie came out?

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.650 align:middle line:10%
And then obviously,
how we handle things.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:90%
How did this impact Fouke?

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And how did it impact
Arkansas in general?

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.625 align:middle line:84%
And was it a positive
impact or a negative one?

00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Was the creature seen again?

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Was there evidence found for it?

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.520 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So we've just started

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.652 align:middle line:84%
We actually start filming
the movie in about a month.

We've never done
anything like this.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:39.040 align:middle line:84%
We had to run a Kickstarter
campaign to actually fund

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:90%
the production of--

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.256 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much did
you have to raise?

00:23:41.256 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: We set the goal at
$9,000, and we raised $17,000.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.557 align:middle line:90%
So we did great on that.

00:23:46.557 --> 00:23:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, good.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So you got what
you need to do it.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.666 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a pretty
good budget documentary.

00:23:51.666 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: For
what we're doing

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.010 align:middle line:84%
it's definitely the highest
we've had to work with.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.191 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted the best quality
we could possibly get.

00:23:59.191 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously, the dream
is to go down to Fouke

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and have a run-in with
Fouke monster ourselves,

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.290 align:middle line:84%
so we could put
that in the movie.

not what I expected.

Arkansas, in your mind,

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.250 align:middle line:90%
you're thinking of Boggy Creek.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.300 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking of the
opening with the swamp,

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.470 align:middle line:90%
and there's this swamp--

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seaweed everywhere
and all that stuff.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.025 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Exactly.

00:24:22.025 --> 00:24:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I found is that it
actually looked really similar

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
to Ohio, to Minerva,
or to Whitehall,

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
which also bears similarities
to the section of Ohio.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.520 align:middle line:90%
It's flat.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of flat pasture
land, dense woods, obviously.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.730 align:middle line:84%
But then you've
got this tiny town

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:90%
tucked in the middle of it.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.830 align:middle line:84%
To really hit that
swampy area-- we

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:84%
had to drive about 20
minutes outside of town just

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.730 align:middle line:90%
to hit that really swampy area.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.750 align:middle line:84%
But that creek, the Boggy
Creek, that obviously

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:84%
lends its namesake to the whole
thing, that actually just runs

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:90%
right outside of town.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.530 align:middle line:90%
It's this tiny little run off.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we drove past
the creek eight times,

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.030 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't realize
that was the creek.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't-- I
guess the-- in your head,

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.984 align:middle line:84%
you're picturing this
epic, massive waterway,

00:25:11.984 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:84%
because you're thinking of
the monster and all that.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So it just-- I
guess, in my head,

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.130 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't quite what it ended
up being like in reality.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are a
lot of internet hoaxes

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and YouTube videos of
these kinds of creatures.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a
quick look at that.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Watch.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:10%
Up here in the top
right hand corner

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:32.905 align:middle line:10%
is where the creature is.

00:25:32.905 --> 00:25:34.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to turn
this up a little bit.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:35.820 align:middle line:10%
Sorry if it's loud.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:42.042 align:middle line:10%
You can hear that it's
breaking through branches.

00:25:42.042 --> 00:25:44.750 align:middle line:10%
Now, the interesting part
for me is right there.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:10%
You can see a little gap.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.540 align:middle line:10%
It walks right through that gap.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.550 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.560 align:middle line:10%
So look how massive
that thing walks.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.800 align:middle line:10%
It walks with great
ease, it looks like.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.425 align:middle line:10%
And then you just
see the face poke out

00:25:54.425 --> 00:25:57.560 align:middle line:10%
from some bushes right there.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I really
couldn't see a creature.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: No.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.792 align:middle line:10%
I didn't either. [LAUGHS]

00:26:01.792 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It sounded dramatic.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of the internet
stuff, especially on YouTube,

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.934 align:middle line:90%
is built around ad revenue.

00:26:09.934 --> 00:26:11.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
some enemies for that.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The more hits you
get, the more you make.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:13.906 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you stick--
and I know this

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:17.940 align:middle line:84%
from putting our
trailers online.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.357 align:middle line:84%
If you put the name Bigfoot
in there or Bigfoot sighting--

00:26:20.357 --> 00:26:21.981 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're going
to get some hits.

00:26:21.981 --> 00:26:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: --in the
headline, you get more hits.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot of it is
built around trying to gain

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:90%
monetarily from whatever.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:33.070 align:middle line:84%
I think there are legitimate
videos that have been taken.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of the
Patterson-Gimlin video.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.380 align:middle line:90%
I like the Freeman footage.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:84%
There's video from Oklahoma
that I find fascinating.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the people
that are constantly

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.230 align:middle line:84%
updating with their
own Bigfoot footage,

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I find a lot of that
really questionable.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seth, it
seems like most

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.210 align:middle line:84%
of the discussions
about these creatures,

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.190 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Whitehall
or Minerva or Boggy Creek

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.240 align:middle line:84%
or god knows where,
we're talking

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:84%
about a similar
creature, aren't we?

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:05.240 align:middle line:84%
It always seems to be that
upright-walking, neighborhood

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.700 align:middle line:84%
of six to nine feet,
6 to 10 feet tall.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Massive shoulder
width, huge creature.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.310 align:middle line:84%
The eyes, you do hear these
reports of glowing eyes,

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.455 align:middle line:84%
which I've always found
to be really such--

00:27:19.455 --> 00:27:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intriguing.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: It is.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:25.210 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the most fascinating
and hard to peg elements

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:10%
of the Bigfoot phenomenon.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Because if you're thinking, OK.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just an upright walking
ape, undiscovered ape,

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:35.380 align:middle line:84%
where do glowing eyes
fit into all of that?

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do
they fit into that?

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:40.019 align:middle line:84%
I want to go through some
internet questions for you,

00:27:40.019 --> 00:27:40.818 align:middle line:90%
Seth.

00:27:40.818 --> 00:27:42.090 align:middle line:90%
We've got Gary from Louisiana.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.673 align:middle line:84%
He says, what do you
think has changed

00:27:43.673 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:84%
the most since you first
got into the Bigfoot

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:90%
investigations?

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Wow.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.870 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I think when I first got into
looking into Bigfoot, the thing

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:84%
that I noticed that changed
the most was the community that

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:84%
has kind of built
up around Bigfoot.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I think there's-- we went from
a-- there's always been a lot

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:90%
of conflict.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.130 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like the
conflict is ramped up

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:90%
in the community itself lately.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is defending their
own viewpoint on it vehemently.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think, for me, I
mean, I know that's probably

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.090 align:middle line:90%
not the most romantic answer.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.260 align:middle line:90%
But that's the biggest change.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.780 align:middle line:84%
As far as the Bigfoot sightings,
they've stayed the same.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.710 align:middle line:84%
People are still seeing
something tall, huge, upright,

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:84%
walking around in
the woods that seems

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:90%
to be an unidentified animal.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Minerva one seems
to be more violent than some

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.420 align:middle line:90%
of the other cases I've heard.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you normally
don't hear about dead deer

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:84%
in a tree or a dog ripped
up or anything like that.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: Well, it's
odd too, because the Cayton

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:84%
family in Minerva, they call
that creature their pet now.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Their pet?

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: They love it.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:90%
The movie ends in Minerva's--

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does he have a name?

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: No.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.400 align:middle line:84%
They haven't-- I
think just Mini.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:90%
I just gave it that.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.870 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that-- they did not

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.030 align:middle line:84%
feel that this was a
threatening animal.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, with the Whitehall
case, that creature

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.520 align:middle line:84%
was screaming at people,
and they actually

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.350 align:middle line:90%
felt threatened by it.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.200 align:middle line:84%
But the Boggy creature is also
supposed to be pretty violent.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it ripped-- there's
a story where it supposedly

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:84%
jumped into the
back of a trailer.

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.827 align:middle line:84%
These guys were hauling a couple
motorcycles down the road,

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and it supposedly jumped into
the back of their trailer,

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.970 align:middle line:84%
ripped up their
motorcycles, and took off.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:30.285 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not on the motorcycle.

00:29:30.285 --> 00:29:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: On a motorcycle,
driving down the-- [LAUGHS]

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That
would be something.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: That would
really add a lot to the movie.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.370 align:middle line:90%
And off it goes.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Cliff from Rochester, New York.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.510 align:middle line:84%
He wants you to explain
Minerva Monster Day.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: Minerva Monster
Day was this fantastic event

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that built up because
of the amount of press

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.870 align:middle line:84%
that Minerva Monster
managed to gain in Ohio.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.820 align:middle line:84%
People were really
fascinated by the story,

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to
learn about the case.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So what we did was we actually
ran a festival out in Minerva,

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.779 align:middle line:84%
where people can come out
and see "Minerva Monster."

00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:03.070 align:middle line:90%
That was what we did last year.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:84%
This year, September
23rd and 24th,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:84%
we're hosting
Minerva Monster Days.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually
Friday and Saturday.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.260 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to run
an all-ages film festival

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.990 align:middle line:10%
on Friday night, so kids can
make their own monster movies

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.790 align:middle line:10%
and--

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:18.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The attendance
is normally pretty good?

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: It's fantastic.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Last year, we had
about 1,200 people.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.210 align:middle line:84%
We packed up every showing
of four showings of the movie

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.044 align:middle line:90%
at the Roxy Theater.

00:30:26.044 --> 00:30:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do
it again this year,

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's going to be
much bigger, because we're

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.700 align:middle line:84%
actually having some
other filmmakers come out

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.690 align:middle line:90%
and bring their movies.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a Loch Ness
Monster short film coming.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:84%
We've got a documentary
about Bigfoot, people that

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.954 align:middle line:90%
have seen Bigfoot, witnesses.

00:30:41.954 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got "Beast
of Whitehall" and "Minerva

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Monster," and we're hoping
to get a speaker, actually,

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.860 align:middle line:90%
in to speak about the film.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So if everything
goes well there,

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.540 align:middle line:84%
we're looking toward a
certain really cool guest.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.149 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That will be good.

00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:58.190 align:middle line:90%
What's your mission here?

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.690 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to
accomplish with all these?

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Document history.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.930 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a family that
owned a historical bookstore,

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:90%
and I grew up around history.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I listened to guys
speak about history

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:84%
almost every
weekend of my youth.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.520 align:middle line:84%
It bored me to tears,
but now that I'm older,

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I understand the importance
of preserving history.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And to a lot of people,
this subject seems silly.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Bigfoot seems silly.

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:27.300 align:middle line:84%
But regardless of your belief,
your own personal belief

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:84%
in the existence of
Bigfoot, these stories

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:84%
happened to the people
that are telling them.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And when those people
pass, those stories

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.380 align:middle line:90%
might pass with them.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And for us to be able to
document things visually with--

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With great witnesses
too, before they die.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And we-- building
off of that, we

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:50.230 align:middle line:84%
lost Paul Gosselin, one of the
boys that was in the truck.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:53.180 align:middle line:84%
The day we decided to make
"Whitehall," he passed away.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.120 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you never
got him on film.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.313 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: We never
got him on film.

00:31:57.313 --> 00:32:00.165 align:middle line:84%
We have the audio tape with
him, which is fantastic.

00:32:00.165 --> 00:32:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that
would live forever.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And so for us, it's always been
about preservation of history

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and to let the witnesses
tell their story.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the entertainment
you see on television

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.320 align:middle line:90%
is over dramatic.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.340 align:middle line:90%
It's over dramatized.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They have to
do something like that.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Supposedly.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But 9 out
of 10 times, nothing

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:84%
happens when they
go on these things.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.815 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Exactly.

00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:24.590 align:middle line:84%
But in my opinion,
those original stories

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.240 align:middle line:84%
are just as creepy,
just as scary

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.890 align:middle line:84%
as someone running
through the woods,

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.520 align:middle line:84%
having someone else
throw rocks at them

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.780 align:middle line:90%
or whatever is going on.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nothing
like the real deal.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear Brian Gosselin
standing in that location,

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:84%
telling his story, I think
that there's an element of fear

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.470 align:middle line:90%
that is added just from that.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's our mission is
to tell it straightforward

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and let the witnesses
tell their story.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is some
audio of an individual who's

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:54.800 align:middle line:84%
flying a Cessna plane,
and he's reporting in

00:32:54.800 --> 00:33:00.240 align:middle line:84%
that there's an object
coming at him, a huge object,

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.700 align:middle line:90%
and then he's gone.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.520 align:middle line:90%
You hear nothing.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:90%
He's gone.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.920 align:middle line:90%
And he's never found again.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.720 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.970 align:middle line:90%
What did he see?

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But those kinds of eyewitness
testimonies are amazing.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.040 align:middle line:90%
You can't beat it.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've always been
sold on the witnesses being

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.940 align:middle line:90%
the real draw of this subject.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm just as fascinated by the
witnesses as I am the monster.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.440 align:middle line:90%
I always say that.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And at the heart of our
films are the people.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- with just
stories about Bigfoot,

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that's just someone
recounting a story.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:84%
When you have the actual
person that lived it tell--

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Saw it.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Witnessed this.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Felt it.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And that adds just such an
element to these that I think

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:45.240 align:middle line:84%
is missing from a lot of
Bigfoot entertainment.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you like to
give them all polygraph tests?

00:33:47.635 --> 00:33:48.676 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: No. [LAUGHS]

00:33:48.676 --> 00:33:49.593 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just to know.

00:33:49.593 --> 00:33:50.392 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: No.

00:33:50.392 --> 00:33:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because
in a lot of cases,

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know that
you can trust a polygraph

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.090 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But I just feel like in
a lot of these cases,

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:03.000 align:middle line:84%
it's almost disingenuous
if I were to do that.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.370 align:middle line:84%
I do believe Howie
Cayton's story.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And I believe I'm pretty
good at reading people.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And with Howie Cayton,
I know something

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.900 align:middle line:90%
happened to that family.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.851 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: It was documented.

00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:84%
It was the police chief
down in Minerva at the time.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.920 align:middle line:84%
He said he witnessed
something as well.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.449 align:middle line:84%
He smelled something very
unusual around their house.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:23.400 align:middle line:90%
The family was full of fear.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So something happened
to that family.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.739 align:middle line:84%
Sticking him in front of
a polygraph, I don't know.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:30.159 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
I feel about it.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:32.449 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it
shakes their foundation,

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:34.659 align:middle line:84%
to be sure, when they
see something like this

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:35.770 align:middle line:90%
and they can't explain it.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Mm-hm.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.250 align:middle line:90%
It changes their lives.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:90%
They're never the same.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:39.679 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Sarah from Baltimore,
Maryland, simply

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:44.000 align:middle line:84%
wants to know if you
know of any native legend

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.820 align:middle line:90%
stories about Bigfoot.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.679 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.310 align:middle line:84%
When I first got into this,
I did a lot of research

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.031 align:middle line:84%
into that element,
because I'm really

00:34:51.031 --> 00:34:53.239 align:middle line:84%
fascinated by native legends
and historical accounts.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
always there.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.262 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you're
familiar with Kathy Strain,

00:34:57.262 --> 00:34:59.220 align:middle line:84%
but she wrote a book
called "Giants, Cannibals,

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and Monsters," and I draw a lot
from that book and her research

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.140 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the historical
or the native accounts,

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
one of the fascinating--
I briefly touched on it.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.600 align:middle line:84%
But there were these
Native American legends

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.380 align:middle line:84%
around the Adirondacks
of creatures

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.590 align:middle line:90%
whose eyes glowed like coal.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And given the red eyes of
the creature that everyone

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.700 align:middle line:84%
witnessed at
Whitehall that night,

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:84%
you wonder if there
isn't something to that.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I find that little bit of
evidence more compelling

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.347 align:middle line:90%
than 1,000 foot print casts.

00:35:33.347 --> 00:35:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And finally, Jim
from Topeka, Kansas,

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.012 align:middle line:84%
says I loved the
"Beast of Whitehall,"

00:35:40.012 --> 00:35:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to
know if there were

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.350 align:middle line:84%
any stories that made
it on the editing floor

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.270 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't see.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.060 align:middle line:90%
There-- thanks, Jim.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.650 align:middle line:84%
He must have been a
Kickstarter supporter.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Because Kickstarter--

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:50.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He might have been.

00:35:50.725 --> 00:35:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Might have been.

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE:
Kickstarter supporters

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.243 align:middle line:84%
were able to actually see the
movie ahead of the release

00:35:54.243 --> 00:35:55.320 align:middle line:90%
date on April 1st.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But there were quite a few
stories that were dropped.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:03.810 align:middle line:84%
There was one story that's
briefly touched on in the film

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:04.940 align:middle line:90%
that I absolutely love.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.110 align:middle line:90%
The Frank McFerrin shooting.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Frank McFerrin actually lived
on a road that ran perpendicular

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.290 align:middle line:84%
to Abair Road, where those
initial sightings happened.

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:18.929 align:middle line:84%
And he claimed to have fired
shots at this creature--

00:36:18.929 --> 00:36:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God, that's not smart.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: --in the
same week that the Abair

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.140 align:middle line:90%
incident happened.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.910 align:middle line:84%
The Abair incident,
which is the tag line

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:29.890 align:middle line:84%
of "Beast of Whitehall,"
the Abair incident

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:33.216 align:middle line:84%
is referring not just to that
initial night, but everything

00:36:33.216 --> 00:36:34.340 align:middle line:90%
that happened following it.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.720 align:middle line:84%
There was about a week
of extreme activity

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.075 align:middle line:84%
over in Whitehall
and Abair Road.

00:36:39.075 --> 00:36:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a call once on
one of our open line shows,

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Seth.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And the guy called and says,
George, me and my buddies,

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:48.260 align:middle line:84%
we're going out, and we're
going to shoot a Bigfoot.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And I kept trying to
tell him, don't go out

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:51.780 align:middle line:90%
there to shoot a Bigfoot.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I can understand if
something's attacking you,

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:90%
and you have to defend yourself.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But just don't blatantly go
out there to shoot a Bigfoot.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I tried to
talk him out of it.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I did or not.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.370 align:middle line:84%
He obviously didn't
shoot a Bigfoot.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But people are geared to doing
that, which also tells me there

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.200 align:middle line:84%
aren't a lot of people running
around in a Bigfoot costume.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.870 align:middle line:84%
There was one guy who got hit
by a car in a Bigfoot outfit.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.100 align:middle line:84%
That's got to be one of
the dumbest things to do.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:84%
With people with that
mentality to shoot.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:22.725 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Exactly.

00:37:22.725 --> 00:37:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And we-- actually,
that is something

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that runs across all
three of our films.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.780 align:middle line:84%
The posses of people that end
up going out looking for Bigfoot

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.810 align:middle line:84%
around the properties of the
people who claim to see him.

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
case with Minerva.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:42.450 align:middle line:84%
We found hundreds,
literally hundreds

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:44.750 align:middle line:84%
of hunters started showing
up on the Cayton's property

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:47.024 align:middle line:84%
with beer and shotguns,
walking up into the woods.

00:37:47.024 --> 00:37:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a party.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:90%
And they had kids.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's children
around the Cayton's house,

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and you've got hunters
up behind their house,

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:56.930 align:middle line:84%
drunk hunters firing shotguns
around their property.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:58.300 align:middle line:90%
So I agree with you.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.762 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be a common
occurrence that people run out

00:38:01.762 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:84%
with guns the second these
sightings start happening.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think of
fraudsters and hoaxsters who

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:12.380 align:middle line:84%
will get a Bigfoot costume
and stuff it with deer guts

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.510 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:18.350 align:middle line:84%
To me, that diminishes and
kills and severely hurts

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:19.911 align:middle line:90%
real investigations.

00:38:19.911 --> 00:38:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.000 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And it also makes
us all look foolish.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that's involved
in this subject,

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.310 align:middle line:84%
the subject of Bigfoot, it makes
the rest of us look foolish.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what people
start connecting with Bigfoot.

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Now they see the body in
the freezer, which everyone

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.230 align:middle line:90%
remembers as that famous hoax.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:42.310 align:middle line:84%
There's-- it damages the
credibility of anyone,

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:46.000 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, that is looking
into the possibility that these

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.350 align:middle line:90%
things might actually exist.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've
tossed a few people

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:55.200 align:middle line:84%
off the show who have, I think,
been questionable and tried

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:59.160 align:middle line:84%
to make money on events
dealing with Bigfoot.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And they've never been
back on the air since.

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: That's
probably a good thing.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:04.430 align:middle line:90%
We don't have them.

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So as the research
continues, are we

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.680 align:middle line:84%
going to get the
answers to this?

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Are we really going to get a
definitive creature, hopefully

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.620 align:middle line:84%
captured, as opposed to killed,
where science can look at it

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.210 align:middle line:90%
and go, oh my god.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:23.120 align:middle line:84%
This probably is the missing
link between ape and man.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Are we ever going to get that?

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: It's hard to say.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Great men have died looking into
this without the answers ever

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:32.900 align:middle line:90%
coming to them.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.399 align:middle line:84%
Grover Krantz passed away,
and he was, obviously,

00:39:35.399 --> 00:39:36.440 align:middle line:90%
heavily involved in this.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.170 align:middle line:84%
He spent his life in
search of this creature.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Rene Dahinden, these guys that
looked into the Bigfoot subject

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:44.610 align:middle line:90%
their whole lives.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.234 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
wonder, if these guys

00:39:46.234 --> 00:39:49.980 align:middle line:84%
were out as much as they
were looking for Bigfoot

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and never found it, even with
the technological advances

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.530 align:middle line:84%
we're having with cell phone
cameras and all of this stuff,

00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:00.540 align:middle line:84%
do we stand any hope of
seeing that in our lifetime?

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And the question I always come
back with is do you want it.

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Do you want the
answer to the mystery?

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
that are into Bigfoot,

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.760 align:middle line:90%
they don't want it.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.556 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's like
Nessie in Scotland.

00:40:12.556 --> 00:40:13.680 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: It's just fun.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.138 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They don't want Nessie
captured because they don't

00:40:16.138 --> 00:40:19.380 align:middle line:10%
want to make sure-- they
don't want to see a large eel,

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.430 align:middle line:10%
for example.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:84%
I want to romanticize
about Nessie.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to think it's a
plesiosaur from the dinosaur

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.600 align:middle line:90%
era.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.450 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want, with its
little flippers and everything

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.700 align:middle line:90%
else, and its long neck.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't want somebody to
find it and say it's a fish,

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.400 align:middle line:90%
or it's that.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that answer.

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:37.426 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: I'm
right in between.

00:40:37.426 --> 00:40:39.140 align:middle line:90%
I like the subject.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.470 align:middle line:90%
I love the subject.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in love with
the mystery of it too.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.174 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
I want an answer.

00:40:45.174 --> 00:40:46.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, you need one.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.230 align:middle line:10%
You expect one.

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at a clip.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.213 align:middle line:84%
And you tell me if you
think it's real or not.

00:40:53.213 --> 00:40:54.013 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:40:54.013 --> 00:41:22.770 align:middle line:90%


00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Clearly you could see
something in the foreground.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Something.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.950 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.380 align:middle line:84%
That's the frustrating
thing about these videos,

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.780 align:middle line:84%
always, to me, is
they're so vague.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.690 align:middle line:90%
And I understand.

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.760 align:middle line:10%
When you're out in
nature, if you actually

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.245 align:middle line:10%
are seeing something
you can't explain,

00:41:40.245 --> 00:41:42.120 align:middle line:10%
you're probably going
to be shaking a little.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: See, that's where
you've got to put the camera

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:45.250 align:middle line:10%
guy on a lie detector test.

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Did he set that up?

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Is that his buddy in a costume?

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.189 align:middle line:84%
Or is that a real creature
he stumbled across?

00:41:51.189 --> 00:41:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: Are we ever
going to reach the level

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.440 align:middle line:90%
of the Patterson-Gimlin film?

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
the real question.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:56.820 align:middle line:10%
Are we ever going
to get something--

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:57.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And some people
still question that, Seth.

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.070 align:middle line:10%
>>BREEDLOVE: Right.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.990 align:middle line:10%
As for something like
that, it's so vague,

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.810 align:middle line:10%
I have no way of telling.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:06.350 align:middle line:84%
You watch the
Patterson-Gimlin film,

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:09.120 align:middle line:84%
it comes down to a question
of well, was it a suit,

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.590 align:middle line:90%
or was it a real creature.

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:13.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not even an
argument of was there

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:15.617 align:middle line:90%
anything in the picture or not.

00:42:15.617 --> 00:42:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
your heart tell you

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.854 align:middle line:84%
about what we might
be looking at?

00:42:18.854 --> 00:42:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: What
does my heart tell me?

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.346 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:42:21.346 --> 00:42:22.580 align:middle line:90%
With all these stories.

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.540 align:middle line:84%
If it's a real creature,
if it's out there,

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I believe the evidence points
to an undiscovered ape.

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And I go back to the
historical sightings

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:33.610 align:middle line:90%
going back into the 1800s.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.150 align:middle line:90%
There were ape reports in Ohio.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is a little more
evolved than a standard ape.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Sure.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Upright-walking,
hair-covered ape.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what I believe
the evidence points to.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not married to one
obvious theory on it.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But that seems to be,
from what I've read

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and from the research I've
done, it looks like it's an ape.

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seems to have
some intelligence though.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE: A lot
of intelligence.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:02.750 align:middle line:10%
And again, there's a lot at play
here beyond just these stories

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.080 align:middle line:10%
that we've talked about today.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.400 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
weird incidents

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.980 align:middle line:90%
involved with this subject.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.980 align:middle line:84%
You always have to wonder, am I
just being hoaxed by everyone?

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.020 align:middle line:84%
What if-- the longer
you're into it,

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.740 align:middle line:84%
the more questions
you have, I'm finding.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If people want
information on you,

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:18.104 align:middle line:90%
Seth, where do they go?

00:43:18.104 --> 00:43:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BREEDLOVE:
Smalltownmonsters.com

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.000 align:middle line:90%
is where I point everyone to.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smalltownmonsters.com

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Yeah.

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Or our Facebook page,
Small Town Monsters.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's exciting.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.690 align:middle line:10%
Keep up the good work, though.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:27.710 align:middle line:10%
It's intriguing, and
somebody's got to do it.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BREEDLOVE: Thank you.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.179 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Creatures, monsters.

00:43:30.179 --> 00:43:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'll ever
get the answer to them.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.011 align:middle line:10%
But it's good to know
that we've got people

00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:36.310 align:middle line:10%
like Seth Breedlove who
are out there to try

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:38.660 align:middle line:10%
to find out if they're real.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory,

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.180 align:middle line:90%
