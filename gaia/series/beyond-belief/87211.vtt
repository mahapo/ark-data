[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:06.076 --> 00:00:07.617 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.617 --> 00:00:08.825 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:10.644 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

>>GEORGE NOORY: Hi,
I'm George Noory,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:90%
and welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.798 align:middle line:10%
You know, since I
was a little boy,

00:00:30.798 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:10%
I've been fascinated with
stories about a hollow Earth.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, when I
first saw the movie, "Journey

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.573 align:middle line:84%
to the Center of the Earth,"
with our dear friend,

00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Pat Boone, I mean I just
couldn't get enough.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
I kept watching it
over and over again.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Could there really be life
like that inside the planet?

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Well our next guest on
"Beyond Belief," of course,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.150 align:middle line:90%
is an author and physicist.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And he is one of the
experts of the possibility

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.800 align:middle line:90%
of a hollow Earth.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BROOKS AGNEW: It is written.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Many are called,
but few are chosen.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of it
a little differently.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Many are called, but few choose.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I've been chosen to lead
the North Pole Inner-Earth

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Expedition.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:90%
My name is Brooks Agnew.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And I choose to start here,
Mount Shasta, at 9,000 feet,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
shrouded in the
mists of mystery,

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:84%
to begin what may be the
greatest geological expedition

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the world-- to
discover if the Earth is hollow

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And with us,
live, Brooks Agnew.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:90%
That's exciting, Brooks.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Thank you very much.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.247 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:01:50.247 --> 00:01:51.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about Mount Shasta

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:90%
and why you picked that spot.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.520 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: Well, there
are a lot of legends

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.072 align:middle line:10%
about where entrances into the
Earth might be, and one of them

00:01:59.072 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:10%
was Shasta.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:90%
So I took several trips there.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:90%
On one, I had a guide.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.584 align:middle line:84%
And we went up to-- all over
the mountain, the places

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
that we could find
to see if there

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:90%
were these legendary openings.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:90%
We didn't find any.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's a pretty
fascinating place.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of legend,
Indian legend and local legend

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:90%
about that mountain.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very mysterious.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big is
that area in that

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:84%
you didn't find an
opening, but what

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
are the possibilities
that there is one there?

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, there
are possibilities

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
that there are openings
into the mountain.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't find one with the
guide that I went with.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
But if I had more
time to go back,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.274 align:middle line:84%
probably would-- would
find them and explore them.

00:02:35.274 --> 00:02:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brooks, could
these possible openings

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.040 align:middle line:90%
be all over the planet?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: I think so.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:90%
I tried to chase them all down.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I went to Tibet and Mexico,
China, Japan-- Mammoth Cave,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Kentucky.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I tried to go chase down
all the legends everywhere,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:84%
where they existed, and get
film and take local testimony

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.420 align:middle line:84%
and talk to the local
geologists to see

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:90%
what they thought about it.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really,
really good experience,

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
the five or six years that
we traveled around the world.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.802 align:middle line:84%
The one thing we
never got to do,

00:03:04.802 --> 00:03:06.510 align:middle line:84%
though, was get above
that Arctic Circle.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.177 align:middle line:84%
That was a very,
very tough challenge.

00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And, of course-- where was it
where Admiral Byrd apparently

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.760 align:middle line:84%
flew right into the
center of the planet?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, in
1926, I think it was,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Byrd decided
to fly over the pole.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And he did so at
less than 3,000 feet,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
which is why he is an aviation
hero and not a statistic.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: And just
took a lot of fuel

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:10%
and came back with
observations that he

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:10%
flew over lush, green
areas with unfrozen water

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:10%
where none should have been.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:84%
No pictures, no evidence,
just that statement.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.121 align:middle line:90%
And that set the world on fire.

00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you're
following that kind of terrain,

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
you're probably flying
into it, and you really

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:90%
don't even know it, right?

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:90%
You just.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Absolutely.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: That's the one thing.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:84%
If there is a
curvature that goes

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
into a depression in the
Earth or even an opening

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
into the Earth,
the aperture will

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
be so large you will not have
any perspective that you're

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.555 align:middle line:90%
actually flying into something.

00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about oceans?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Would they go in there, too?

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.663 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Oceans would
do that as well.

00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
If the crust really did
have an aperture like that

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and if it did exist, most likely
it would exist at the poles.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:10%
If the crust did thin
at a point like that,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:10%
the ocean would curve with
it, because the ocean just

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.910 align:middle line:10%
sticks on the
crust with gravity.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
It just moves around
with-- by the moon.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did we
even get these theories

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:90%
that the planet could be hollow?

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.135 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: The ancients
had a lot of legend,

00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:10%
the Tibetans, the early
settlers of the Yucatan area.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.715 align:middle line:84%
The Popol Vuh talks
about life coming out

00:04:39.715 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:90%
of the inside of the Earth.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:90%
The Egyptians talk about it.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So to have these
ancient legends,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:84%
these well-developed
dynasties that

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.550 align:middle line:84%
believed that there was
some lifeforce, some way

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
of surviving on the
inside of the planet,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:84%
it was scientifically,
I think, maybe

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.352 align:middle line:84%
irresponsible to
not investigate it.

00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now these
legends, do they

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:84%
seem to be coming
from civilizations

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:90%
all around the planet?

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do?

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.391 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, it's
almost universal.

00:05:09.391 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi Indians, to
Eskimos, to people

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:84%
that live in Europe
and South America,

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:90%
they all have the same legends.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.260 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
the flood legend.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:90%
It exists everywhere.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.696 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
the planet have

00:05:22.696 --> 00:05:25.094 align:middle line:84%
formed with this kind
of hollowness to it?

00:05:25.094 --> 00:05:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well that is a
really great question.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.110 align:middle line:84%
We sort of see, when
we look out into space,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
different stages of
planetary development.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But man hasn't really
been around long enough

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.880 align:middle line:84%
with telescopes to
actually see a planet form.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:84%
We think the way it happens
is with an accretion disc.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like a giant plate of
dust in space that's revolving.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And slowly it will
begin to coagulate

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
into planets and
then a central sun.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the planets
will form very quickly,

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.329 align:middle line:84%
and that means they're
spinning very, very quickly.

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:56.245 align:middle line:90%
And they get lopsided.

00:05:56.245 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And they'll throw piece
of themselves off,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:90%
and that'll be a moon.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll become
unstable, overheated,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.257 align:middle line:84%
and they'll explode and
become an asteroid belt.

00:06:04.257 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.675 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: But sometimes they
just expand and cool, expand

00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and cool, expand and cool,
and they form planets.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're gas
giants, and sometimes they're

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:90%
solid, like Earth is.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Earth happens to be
at the right distance

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:84%
from the sun where water
can be liquid and not steam.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's conducive for
the enzymatic activity

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:90%
we call life.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Goldilocks Zone.

00:06:26.225 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.641 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As we say.

00:06:27.641 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about the core
that I hear so much about,

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth
has a molten core.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:84%
If it's hollow, I'm
picturing like an empty hole.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.414 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case?

00:06:38.414 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That's not
the case with Earth.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:84%
It could be the case
with other planets.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because
we have this very powerful,

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.070 align:middle line:84%
multilayered magnetosphere
around the planet.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Early theories were that we had
some kind of molten convection

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:84%
going on in the
center of the Earth,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:84%
that we lived on a
molten ball in space,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and we existed on tectonic
plates like corn flakes

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:90%
in a bowl of milk.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.460 align:middle line:84%
That theory held for a
long time, all the while,

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:90%
while I was in school.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:84%
But then we started
getting better and better

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:84%
at hooking the seismographic
listening stations together

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and using them to use
earthquakes to kind of take

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.712 align:middle line:84%
an MRI of the Earth,
a CAT scan as it were.

00:07:19.712 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we started to
get images of the Earth,

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.260 align:middle line:90%
it didn't look like that all.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the space images of
Earth and space measurements

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.160 align:middle line:84%
of the distance from
the Earth to the sun

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and the mass of
the Earth, things

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:84%
just didn't seem to line
up with that theory.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So it called into
question a lot of that

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
what we call planetary
core geology.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And so many questions
that it really

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
began to put weight
into the hypothesis

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
that planets might
form as hollow spheres.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what would be
holding the core in its place

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.650 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't drop down to
the bottom of the planet?

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Well, its magnetism.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.263 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: And really.

00:07:56.263 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like
floating down there?

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, the last
two years, we-- not we, not

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
my team, but they discovered
that the core of the Earth

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:84%
is actually a
solid iron crystal.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.970 align:middle line:84%
They know this because
it's anisotropic, that is

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.650 align:middle line:90%
to say it has grain to it.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:14.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not molten at all.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Its perhaps 13 or 14 grams
or cubic centimeters.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it like a little
planet within the planet?

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, very,
very dense, one piece

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:10%
of iron in the center.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it's spinning at the
original speed of the planet,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.500 align:middle line:84%
then the crust has
expanded and slowed

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:84%
down-- the conservation
of momentum.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:84%
That means that there's
a counter rotation

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.706 align:middle line:84%
between a solid iron core and
a multi-metal, silica crust,

00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:39.164 align:middle line:84%
which would make
a great generator.

00:08:39.164 --> 00:08:40.372 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well that's amazing.

00:08:40.372 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's like a
power plant, isn't it?

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:42.934 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:08:42.934 --> 00:08:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But some planets, like
Mars, have no magnetosphere.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible they
don't have a core

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.910 align:middle line:84%
or that the core and the crust
are rotating at the same speed.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a dead
planet without a core?

00:08:54.145 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I would think on
the surface you would be,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:84%
because the sun puts out a
broad range of frequencies.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Some of those are not
conducive to life.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:90%
They break apart DNA.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So it would literally sterilize
the surface of the planet.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to have some
way to route those higher

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:90%
frequencies around the planet.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you would
have to have a core.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How deep
would the mantle

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.570 align:middle line:84%
be before you would,
let's say, bust through,

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:84%
if you were drilling, and
then you would hit emptiness?

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: The theory is
that the crust is actually

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.049 align:middle line:90%
around 900 to 1,000 miles thick.

00:09:30.049 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Now, you say drilling.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:84%
The deepest hole ever
drilled is about eight miles.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.158 align:middle line:90%
Just, just.

00:09:37.158 --> 00:09:39.116 align:middle line:84%
>>>>NOORY: Was that by
the Soviets at the time?

00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:10%
Those very deep holes.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're-- they're
still drilling them,

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:90%
but it's very slow progress.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:84%
You're holding on to eight
miles of steel in that hole.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's not like you're
going to bust through and hit

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Not at eight miles.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --center of the planet?

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: No.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So the center of the crust,
although it may be solid on top

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and may be solid on
the inside, is probably

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:90%
a lot of fluid magma.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Because that crust is
undulating all the time,

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:84%
with the tidal
gravity from the moon

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.375 align:middle line:84%
and other gravitational
bodies in space.

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brooks, in
the movie, "Journey

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
to the Center of the Earth,"
once they got into the center,

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:84%
there was an ocean,
there was sun-like area,

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
where there was like a
little tiny star there.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:84%
What would our center
of the Earth look like?

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:90%
And is there any life there?

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Two really
great questions.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.966 align:middle line:84%
The iron core is expected to
be somewhere around 11,000

00:10:28.966 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:84%
degrees, which is
a little hotter

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.506 align:middle line:90%
than the surface of the sun.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's hot.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Whether or
not it would put off

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.840 align:middle line:84%
light that would be conducive
to photosynthetic activity

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.060 align:middle line:90%
remains to be seen.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Iron doesn't emit light
in that wavelength.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
We see it in light
bulbs, but it's not

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:84%
really conducive to
growing big plants.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:84%
The idea that there's
life inside the planet--

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:90%
I will say this as a scientist.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Earth is prolific.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:84%
If there is a void anywhere, in
the crust or beneath the crust,

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.460 align:middle line:90%
there will be life there.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.377 align:middle line:90%
It might be microbial.

00:11:03.377 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It might
be creatures, right?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.699 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It might
be more complex.

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:08.740 align:middle line:84%
It would certainly be
different living conditions

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.940 align:middle line:90%
than the surface.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Historically, we
have heard stories and myths

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.070 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs, unidentified
objects that

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
seem to be going inside holes
in the planet and out again.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So assume for a moment what
they see is actually that.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:84%
That tells me that there could
be an entire civilization down

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:90%
there, if possible.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Most of the ocean,
except from satellite,

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:90%
is unexplored.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:84%
We sail on seaways, like
roads, between countries.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.390 align:middle line:84%
We use it for commerce, not
much for exploration anymore.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the areas above
the 60th or 70th parallel

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:84%
are very, very
seldom are sailed.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Above the 80th parallel, you
don't see any ships at all.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
There are just areas of the
Earth man has not seen yet.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean how possible
is it that there are actually

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
creatures, intelligent
life down there-- cities?

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, you access
the little boy in me, too,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.089 align:middle line:90%
when you ask those questions.

00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:09.963 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: As a scientist,
I can't rule anything out.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
But I also have
to be reasonable.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that there's another
seven billion people living

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:84%
on the inside of the planet
or other kinds of creatures.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's a cinch that all the
UFO sightings that we have

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:84%
around the world
cannot be wrong.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is living
here besides us.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Hopi Indians
have talked about ant people.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:84%
To me an ant person is something
that lives underground, right?

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That would be
the kind of structure

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to have to
live beneath the Earth.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So maybe.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:84%
What's science doing
about it, Brooks?

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on in terms of
investigations or expeditions

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.797 align:middle line:84%
to find out if this
is real or not?

00:12:57.797 --> 00:12:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, that's
actually the fun part.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.920 align:middle line:84%
There are several universities--
Washington University did

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:84%
a study where they took
all of the seismograms--

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
these are the printouts that
have been generated by all

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:84%
the US Geological Surveys
around the planet--

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and they decided to
crunch all that data.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And when they did
that, they found

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:84%
damping waves of another ocean
underneath the Atlantic Ocean.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: The same kind of
waves like the waves crashing

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:90%
on a beach.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So it was such a
stunning article,

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and it was really
a great finding.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.537 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to the people at
Washington University,

00:13:36.537 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and they were excited
about the study.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:90%
They stood behind it.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:84%
They said it's not
just wet ground.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.237 align:middle line:90%
We're talking an open sea--

00:13:43.237 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --underneath
the Atlantic Ocean,

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
perhaps as big as
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:48.835 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It is.

00:13:48.835 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How in the heck did
that much water get down there?

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, if the crust is
what we think it is or the way

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:84%
this theory is, that
the crust actually

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:84%
has part of the
mass of the Earth

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and the core has part of the
mass of the Earth, the crust

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.310 align:middle line:84%
itself will have gravitational
fields on the surface, which

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.880 align:middle line:84%
is where we are,
and on the inside.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Although Newton's theory
seems to refute that.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
His thin-shell physics
are just extrapolated

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:90%
to make thick-shell physics.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.540 align:middle line:90%
So there could be flaws in it.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.410 align:middle line:84%
It could be that
the crust actually

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.370 align:middle line:90%
has its own gravitational field.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
The core has its own
gravitational field.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.779 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:84%
If there's an ocean
down there, there

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.946 align:middle line:84%
could be life,
sea life at least.

00:14:30.946 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: If there's
liquid water there,

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:90%
there absolutely will be life.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I just saw a
report, a few months ago,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:10%
that there could be another
planet within the planet,

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.730 align:middle line:10%
like as the planet was shaped.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:90%
So maybe it is hollow.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:84%
But that there could
be two planets, one

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:90%
on top of the other.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It makes
magnetic sense.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:90%
I always found it amusing.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.110 align:middle line:10%
A few years ago, they
released a statement

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.694 align:middle line:10%
that Pluto was no longer
considered a planet,

00:14:58.694 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:10%
because it was hollow.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A planetoid, right?

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:01.832 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah.

00:15:01.832 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
did they determine

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.420 align:middle line:90%
that it was so hollow?

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Just satellite
measurements of it.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.140 align:middle line:84%
They determined that
it was hollow based

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.756 align:middle line:84%
on its orbit and the
light that it gives off,

00:15:11.756 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:90%
the heat that it gives off.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:84%
They were able to determine
that it was hollow.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.658 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think in the Arctic

00:15:15.658 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:84%
that there is literally a
hole, and, if you looked

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.910 align:middle line:84%
at it from space, you would
see like a doughnut-type hole?

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: If the aperture is that
big, 80, 100, 200 miles across,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.654 align:middle line:84%
and it's filled with water
or almost filled with water,

00:15:29.654 --> 00:15:31.320 align:middle line:84%
you should be able
to see it from space.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:84%
The problem-- there
are two problems.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.520 align:middle line:84%
One is that we don't get
satellite information

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
above a certain parallel due
to, I believe it was 2006,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.019 align:middle line:90%
the Data Denial Act was passed.

00:15:42.019 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck is that?

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It's an agreement
between Eumetsat, which

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
is the European version
of NOAA, and the NOAA.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.490 align:middle line:84%
They decided to not
release to the public

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:84%
any images above
the 60th parallel.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's strange.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:90%
What are they hiding?

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, the theory is,
at least if you read the act,

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
that there is a reasonable
suspicion that that imagery is

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:84%
so good that it would
provide tracking or pathway

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.440 align:middle line:84%
information to
enemies who might want

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to attack either Europe or
the US with cruise missiles.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.090 align:middle line:84%
So they did not release
the imaging data.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:20.630 align:middle line:10%
Still, the fact that there
are no pictures at all--

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:10%
Google it yourself, there's
just no photographs of Earth.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's bizarre.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Google Earth
is largely animated

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.480 align:middle line:90%
above the 60th parallel.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.699 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's as if
they're hiding something.

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It sure
makes us suspicious.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:84%
We like the, we
like the daylight.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:84%
We want to shine the
light on the evidence.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what
about expeditions

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
to go there and see
if that's possible?

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We mounted
an expedition.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:90%
I became part of it in 2006.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
It turned out to be
a very large project.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:53.420 align:middle line:10%
We needed a long, 450-foot
long Russian ice breaker.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.690 align:middle line:84%
We needed some international
agreements, which we got.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.590 align:middle line:84%
We needed a good
science team, so we

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
got Stanford, MIT, Washington
University, as I mentioned,

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and some historians to make
up the 100 person crew.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:84%
We started to put a
business plan together.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.911 align:middle line:84%
And we had one of the worst
economies in my lifetime, 2008.

00:17:11.911 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yes, you got it.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.744 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: And that
sunk the whole thing.

00:17:14.744 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:10%
So it-- it was not a matter
of going inside the Earth.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.140 align:middle line:84%
It was a matter of going to
get data that we did not have,

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:84%
to take floor samples off
the bottom of the sea.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.570 align:middle line:84%
We had a tectonic plate expert
from Stanford University

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:90%
coming.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.006 align:middle line:84%
We were going to take Earth
magnetism measurements.

00:17:33.006 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:10%
We were going to measure
the curvature of the ocean

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:10%
to see if this oceanic
depression could actually

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:10%
be mapped.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
It was some serious science
that was going to be done.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:84%
It would've answered
a lot of questions.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When Jules
Verne wrote "Journey

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:10%
to the Center of the Earth,"
how did he know this?

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's give him credit
that maybe he was creative.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:90%
And it was a novel.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, it's pretty striking
that what he wrote in that book

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.780 align:middle line:84%
is pretty darn
similar to the things

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
you've been trying
to investigate.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It is.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:90%
I would say he made it up.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:84%
But look at all the historical
evidence that was there.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:84%
There are legends
in every country's

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.840 align:middle line:84%
major religious writings
or historical documents

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:84%
that there was activity
going on under the Earth.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So it was a natural
iteration for him.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:84%
But Jules Verne was
absolutely a visionary.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:84%
"20,000 Leagues Under the
Sea," "Journey to the Moon,"

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:84%
all of those things
that Jules Verne saw,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:90%
we did-- except that one.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happens next?

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:84%
How do we get to see if this
is indeed a real theory?

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Earth doesn't
always cooperate.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:48.080 align:middle line:84%
In 2007, there was a
state-sized piece of ice

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:90%
that broke off the Arctic.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.257 align:middle line:84%
It was a strange
weather pattern.

00:18:51.257 --> 00:18:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.131 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It was a wind that
blew for a period of weeks,

00:18:54.131 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:90%
and it just stressed the ice.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:19:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And in Arctic terms,
we call it calving.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:90%
It calved a piece of ice off.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And it opened the
Northwest Passage

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.440 align:middle line:84%
to the sea for the first time
in-- we don't know-- probably

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:90%
200,000 years.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So we had a window there
of about two years,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.970 align:middle line:84%
we could sail in there
in the summertime

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and actually do some
good mapping, maybe

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:84%
15,000 18,000 square
miles in a couple weeks.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:90%
But that has since re-iced over.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It's now covered with
about five meters of ice.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And the Arctic is
growing very rapidly now.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you
to speculate on this.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Tell us-- let's assume the
hollow Earth theory is correct.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And you're in this ship
going to look for it.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what's happening
as you approach this hole.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.295 align:middle line:90%
And what's going on?

00:19:43.295 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, we had a
lot of meetings about that,

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:90%
a lot of brainstorming sessions.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.010 align:middle line:90%
We have 100 scientists.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
historians, some of them

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
believers, which in science
you really can't believe.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:90%
You have to go for evidence.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
to have the facts.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.941 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: You've got to have
the drive to look for them.

00:19:59.941 --> 00:20:03.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you find something that
disproves your hypothesis,

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:90%
you need to report that.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the mindset of the
people that were in this group.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:90%
But we're on a ship.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:90%
There's no rescue.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:90%
There's no extension cord.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:84%
There's no going
back for supplies.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:14.776 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're on your own.

00:20:14.776 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: No one is
coming to get you.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So there is that
isolation, like we're

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:84%
somewhere between Earth
and Mars kind of feeling.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And the idea that
the crew and that staff

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
are really the
only consciousness

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:84%
anywhere for 500 miles
in any direction,

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
we're like a
consciousness beacon.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
There was the feeling that, if
there is a civilization living

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:84%
up there, under the sea or
inside the Earth, as we talked

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:84%
about, maybe a population
of, let's call them,

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.590 align:middle line:84%
ultra-terrestrials,
we would stick out

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.860 align:middle line:84%
like a bright light in
the middle of a black sea.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:90%
So there was that thought.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.390 align:middle line:84%
What if-- you
know, we're getting

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.039 align:middle line:84%
close to where they are--
they come up to see us?

00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Then what do we do?

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you ready for that?

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Sure, because, you
know, there's no like, oh,

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.199 align:middle line:90%
hold on while I go get this.

00:21:14.199 --> 00:21:15.740 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
everything with you.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.817 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are
they friendly or not?

00:21:17.817 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the other thing.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.299 align:middle line:84%
It's a Russian,
nuclear-powered ice-breaker

00:21:22.299 --> 00:21:23.590 align:middle line:90%
but there are no weapons on it.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: But we were going to
film not only in visible light

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.187 align:middle line:90%
but also in IR.

00:21:29.187 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And someone asked, why
are we filming in IR?

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:84%
I said because some technology
out there lets them bend light.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:84%
You can't see things visibly,
but they show up easy with IR.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:84%
We had a photographer who used
to literally tape two cameras

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:84%
together, filming the
same thing, one in IR,

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:90%
one in visible.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:90%
And it was phenomenal.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.512 align:middle line:84%
Things that you
could see in infrared

00:21:52.512 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:90%
you could not see in visible.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You couldn't see.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: No, not at all.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So as you
go into the hole,

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.055 align:middle line:84%
do you even know
you're in the hole?

00:22:01.055 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We would know because
the ship would be equipped

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:84%
with a precision
gyroscope, similar to what

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:08.746 align:middle line:90%
would be used to aim missiles.

00:22:08.746 --> 00:22:10.954 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you'd see a
curvature change or something

00:22:10.954 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:11.775 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:22:11.775 --> 00:22:15.540 align:middle line:84%
The horizon in the ship would be
stable to itself not the Earth.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So it wouldn't be gravity
giving us that horizon,

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:84%
it would actually
be the gyroscope.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So if we began to over
rotate, beyond the distance

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're actually
traveling across the sea,

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:84%
we would know we were sailing
into that oceanic depression.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what
point do you stop?

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how far down would
it go in terms of a hole?

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: The plan was to go
in the peak of summer, which

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:90%
the sun does not set up there.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.272 align:middle line:84%
It goes around you,
like 360 degrees.

00:22:42.272 --> 00:22:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you'd have light.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.188 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Correct.

00:22:44.188 --> 00:22:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Once the sun started to
dip below the horizon,

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
we would know we
were sailing in.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:90%
That's the point where you stop.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm trying to
visualize this, Brooks.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And the ocean would
keep going in, right?

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.919 align:middle line:90%
Would come back out like that?

00:23:00.919 --> 00:23:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Not till
it went all the way

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.200 align:middle line:84%
around the inside of
the crust and you'd

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:90%
come out on the South Pole.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.867 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh?

00:23:06.867 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It's interesting
to read the old maritime

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.940 align:middle line:84%
records, you know, before
there was a radar and all that.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Ships did not get out
of sight of the shore.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:84%
They sailed along
the shorelines.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.292 align:middle line:84%
But then they got brave enough
to sail out over the ocean.

00:23:20.292 --> 00:23:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't fall off
the edge of the world.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.180 align:middle line:90%
They reached other continents.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.180 align:middle line:84%
But they used to sail
together, in groups.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And they would sail
far enough apart

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that they wouldn't run into each
other, if they run into fog,

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.055 align:middle line:84%
but close enough where
they could come to one

00:23:33.055 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:90%
another's aid.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And the maritime logs are
interesting, that they actually

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:84%
see the other ship disappear,
for like a day at a time,

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.624 align:middle line:84%
and then it comes
right back up again.

00:23:43.624 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: So it's sailing into
these low places in the sea.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed an
admiral from the Navy.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And he calls those the
oceanic depressions.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.225 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, why do
you think those happen?

00:23:56.225 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, they might be areas of
the Earth where the gravity is,

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.682 align:middle line:84%
you know, stronger, and it
just pulls the sea down.

00:24:01.682 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, that's
an interesting take.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:04.054 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh?

00:24:04.054 --> 00:24:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: What if it was an
area where gravity was actually

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
very low, and it was this
surrounding gravity that

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.595 align:middle line:84%
pulled the water
away from that point?

00:24:12.595 --> 00:24:13.970 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's
very interesting.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:90%
I never thought about that.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:84%
If there was an opening,
that's exactly--

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what would happen

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --the kind of
phenomenon you would see.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then that curvature
would be ever so slight.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.790 align:middle line:84%
See, I sometimes--
I'm trying to picture.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.480 align:middle line:84%
You'd get to the
top of the opening,

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:90%
and you'd like fall in.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not that way at all, is it?

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:90%
It's very gradual?

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: No.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.390 align:middle line:84%
When you're on the
sea, at six feet high,

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.850 align:middle line:84%
you have a view
eight miles away.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
The earth curves away,
eight miles away.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
100 mile opening,

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:45.950 align:middle line:90%
you'll never see that curvature.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:10%
What happens next?

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:10%
Does anybody try to go in there?

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, there have
been several that have tried.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the guy
that patented it

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.890 align:middle line:84%
died from pneumonia
trying to do it.

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:10%
And let's see, Edmond
Halley wrote about in 1629.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're going
to do this, it's

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.035 align:middle line:84%
got to be done either by air,
by probably lighter than air

00:25:10.035 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:84%
craft, if we get the
winds to cooperate.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:16.040 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: That's probably
going to be the way to do it.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:10%
So many people have
been doing these close

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.520 align:middle line:10%
to space shots with
these GoPro cameras.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating stuff.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Even high school
kids are doing it.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.680 align:middle line:84%
We thought about mounting some
different altitude balloons

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and letting them go over and
see what we can see that way.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:35.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Admiral Byrd claimed
that he met intelligent beings

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.830 align:middle line:10%
in this hollow Earth, that he
was greeted by it, that he saw

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:10%
strange animals, the
vegetation that you mentioned.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.597 align:middle line:10%
How could he make that up
if it was just a story?

00:25:48.597 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, it's possible
he didn't make it up.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.230 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that someone
made it up for him.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I read what was
supposedly his diary.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.430 align:middle line:84%
We have-- we classify
all the data.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And these things are what
we call personal testimony.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Or it's factual,
because they actually

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.119 align:middle line:90%
made a direct observation.

00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:07.160 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to put it
into personal testimony.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.150 align:middle line:84%
There's no leaf, there's
no rock, there's no bone,

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.494 align:middle line:84%
or a picture or
something to back it up.

00:26:12.494 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't throw
it out altogether.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.070 align:middle line:84%
But you start to
classify that and look

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
for similar items
in those to see

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.195 align:middle line:84%
if there's things that
need to be investigated

00:26:21.195 --> 00:26:22.940 align:middle line:84%
or samples that
need to be gathered.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So I put that whole diary in
the area of personal testimony.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And I really did not
give it much credence.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I watched several documentaries
with Admiral Byrd,

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and he did not seem like
that kind of person.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:84%
He had an almost military
explorer kind of vocabulary.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No nonsense type.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: He was
an ultra-patriot.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
If the government asked him
to keep something secret,

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:90%
he would take it to his grave.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:55.792 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion,
is the planet hollow?

00:26:55.792 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: In my opinion,
there's enough question

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.750 align:middle line:90%
to say it's possible.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.940 align:middle line:10%
It's possible.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were down there,
would you be able to get back?

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, that's
a good question.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I'd-- we really didn't have a
plan to take a nuclear-powered

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:84%
ship under the
inside of the planet.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.060 align:middle line:10%
But there was a
helicopter on the ship.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:10%
We could take
excursions with that

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:10%
to get further--
further information.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:84%
The idea behind the
entire expedition

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:84%
was to be as open
as we could with it.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:84%
We were going to film
everything, 24 hours a day.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It would be a great reality
show if nothing else.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.254 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: 100 scientists from
all around the world trapped

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:38.720 align:middle line:84%
on a boat, 500 miles
from everywhere.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:84%
That makes "Lost," you know,
look like a commercial.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: But the idea that--
that we would actually

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:84%
meet something out
there, whether it's

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
from inside the Earth or under
the sea was so fascinating,

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.104 align:middle line:84%
we just had to be
ready to do it.

00:27:54.104 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:90%
It was frightening actually.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it's
real, why is NASA,

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.970 align:middle line:84%
why is the government
not telling us?

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.880 align:middle line:90%
What's so secret about this?

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: That always upsets us.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:10%
You know, we have
tax money that's

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:10%
spent in these exploratory
organizations, JPL, NASA,

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:10%
others.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.115 align:middle line:84%
And then when the data is
gathered, it's screened

00:28:18.115 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:84%
or it's airbrushed
or it's withheld.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:25.170 align:middle line:10%
And you can make a statement
for national security reasons,

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.700 align:middle line:10%
but people want to know.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, George, I've
done science my whole life.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen
a subject matter

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.197 align:middle line:90%
that had a fan base, that had--

00:28:40.197 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh,
it's got it all.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --enthusiasts
that were so passionate.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:84%
The idea of a hollow Earth isn't
just like going to the moon.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:52.170 align:middle line:90%
It bonds people.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.186 align:middle line:84%
They get emotional about it,
like its roots or something.

00:28:55.186 --> 00:28:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:56.727 align:middle line:90%
It's almost religious.

00:28:56.727 --> 00:28:57.893 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It's very powerful.

00:28:57.893 --> 00:28:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:28:59.890 align:middle line:90%
It's very strong.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if there
are people down there,

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:84%
intelligent beings,
maybe they've

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.600 align:middle line:84%
been down there since the
beginning of time, I guess.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they, when
this planet evolved,

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.380 align:middle line:90%
maybe that's where they were.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I would doubt that people from
the surface went down there.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
probably already there.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.035 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It could be.

00:29:21.035 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the
scriptures it says

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.080 align:middle line:84%
that the 10 tribes
disappeared, and that they

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.830 align:middle line:84%
will return one day
on a highway of ice.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like they'll be
coming out of the north.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian writings,
there's a woman--

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:90%
she goes by the name Amseti.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:36.920 align:middle line:90%
She's passed on now.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:90%
But her books were interesting.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And I held her manuscripts
of her Egyptian translations

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:47.780 align:middle line:84%
into English in my hands, and
I photographed this one page

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.530 align:middle line:84%
where it said that the
people of the day--

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:53.175 align:middle line:84%
it was a great tragedy-- and
they escaped into the Earth.

00:29:53.175 --> 00:29:54.800 align:middle line:84%
That's what it says
in the translation.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.522 align:middle line:90%
So they could be there?

00:29:57.522 --> 00:29:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It's powerful stuff.

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And we have also reports
that some of the Nazis,

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.182 align:middle line:90%
after World War II.

00:30:03.182 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were obsessed
with this, I think.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.509 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: They were moving goods
down there using submarines.

00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are several
submarines unaccounted for.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.696 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: So it's quite possible.

00:30:13.696 --> 00:30:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
anybody want to live

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.980 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the Earth?

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.770 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: Well, we were talking
earlier about the Goldilocks

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:21.270 align:middle line:10%
zone.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:21.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: It is very rare.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.180 align:middle line:84%
For 25,000 light years
in every direction

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.159 align:middle line:84%
we look, we have not
seen a planet like Earth.

00:30:27.159 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like us, that's right.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Too cold, too hot.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:84%
If there are beings
on other worlds,

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and statistically
it's reasonable,

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.260 align:middle line:84%
they would probably live on
the inside of their planets.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:84%
This happens to be
one of the worlds

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:84%
where you can live
on the outside.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.287 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're a rarity.

00:30:42.287 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Brooks, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Thank you
very much, George.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
exciting, isn't it?

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Just to think that the
planet could be hollow

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and that maybe
there are creatures

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.540 align:middle line:84%
or human beings living
within the planet.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:90%
It does make you think.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.860 align:middle line:10%
On an upcoming episode
of "Beyond Belief,"

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Brooks Agnew
will talk with us

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.560 align:middle line:10%
about one of his new ventures.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.700 align:middle line:10%
It's exciting.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.950 align:middle line:10%
You don't want to miss it.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:08.740 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.190 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:24.634 align:middle line:90%
