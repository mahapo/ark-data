you remember your dream

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:25.559 align:middle line:90%
from last night?

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.862 align:middle line:84%
And just simply what
does it mean?

Let's welcome to
Beyond Belief Kelly.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.144 align:middle line:90%
Hey, how are you?

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.245 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you with us.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:46.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: It's great
to be with you George.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:47.948 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Strange dreams

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:52.084 align:middle line:84%
and dreams of-- what
do they mean?

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:55.923 align:middle line:84%
People wake up in the morning
and they go, oh, my gosh.

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:58.158 align:middle line:90%
What did that mean?

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:01.395 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw to you
some various aspects of dreams

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and then you can tell me what
they mean and what they do.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Super.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:07.968 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: As a
dream expert have you found

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:10.938 align:middle line:84%
that in this day and age
with so many things going

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:15.375 align:middle line:84%
on that people are
dreaming more about things

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
that are truly current events
or are they dreaming less?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: It depends on the
person but I'd say in general,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
people are dreaming about the
drama that they're seeing on TV,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.289 align:middle line:84%
the weather, the crazy things
that are happening politically.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.192 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
having dreams

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:36.196 align:middle line:84%
that reflect those
realities and yet it's lovely

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.999 align:middle line:90%
when we can have a dream sojourn

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.469 align:middle line:84%
that goes beyond the ordinary
things that are happening

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.905 align:middle line:84%
in this world where we can
get a higher perspective.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:48.542 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like zooming out
from the world and going oh,

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:50.677 align:middle line:84%
wait a second there's
a big universe here

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:51.845 align:middle line:90%
and we're a part of that.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.281 align:middle line:84%
It can give us that
larger perspective

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:56.483 align:middle line:84%
so that we can come
back down to earth

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:59.052 align:middle line:84%
and actually be of
some earthly good.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.454 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: There's nothing
like a dream

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.156 align:middle line:84%
that changes your
life and affects it.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:04.925 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's so powerful.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:07.894 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Oh yeah, and these
dreams that some people have,

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:10.931 align:middle line:84%
I've had my own and some people
that I write about and talk

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:15.202 align:middle line:84%
about have had really powerful
dreams from years before

00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and over time the energy of that
dream becomes more significant,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
more visceral and has a
continuing positive effect.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.848 align:middle line:84%
So not just healing a body but
being able to take a person

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:30.951 align:middle line:84%
into the realm of beyond
surviving into thriving,

00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:32.152 align:middle line:90%
into doing really, really well.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.954 align:middle line:84%
I have an example of
that but I don't know

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:34.721 align:middle line:90%
if you want me to go into that.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:35.355 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah go ahead.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about it.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Well, Diane
who I write about in

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.427 align:middle line:90%
"It's All in Your Dreams."

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:45.165 align:middle line:84%
She had a dream that she
was-- it was a simple dream.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:48.135 align:middle line:84%
She had a dream that she was
floating and she was surrounded

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:50.303 align:middle line:84%
in all these beautiful
billowing fabrics

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:52.406 align:middle line:90%
and she found herself smiling

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:56.443 align:middle line:84%
and in the dream she
audibly heard smile.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:57.711 align:middle line:90%
Smile big.

00:02:57.711 --> 00:02:59.713 align:middle line:90%
Smile as big as you can kind

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:02.349 align:middle line:84%
of like Candid Camera
kind of a thing.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.352 align:middle line:84%
She woke up laughing
and smiling and feeling

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.888 align:middle line:90%
so good in this dream.

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:09.256 align:middle line:90%
And she wrote some about this.

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:10.824 align:middle line:84%
She sent me an e-mail and said,
"What does this dream mean?"

00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:13.692 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Honey, some
dreams are good to interpret,

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:17.064 align:middle line:84%
other dreams are just to
meditate and marinate in.

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:20.333 align:middle line:84%
Use the energy of
this dream every day.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.701 align:middle line:84%
Think about the energy
of this dream.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.403 align:middle line:90%
Remember how it felt."

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.272 align:middle line:84%
I got an e-mail from
her six months later.

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:27.874 align:middle line:84%
I had never heard
from her before.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Six months later she
said, "This is Diane.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.613 align:middle line:84%
I'm the smile big lady and what
I didn't tell you six months ago

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:37.216 align:middle line:84%
was I had been diagnosed
terminal brain cancer.

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:40.019 align:middle line:84%
I'd been given three
months to live

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.656 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't want to do chemo.

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.057 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want do
all of the things

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.093 align:middle line:84%
that the doctors
wanted me to do but out

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:49.229 align:middle line:90%
of nowhere I got this dream

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.131 align:middle line:84%
and I had nothing
to smile big about.

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.799 align:middle line:90%
My life had fallen apart.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:90%
My relationship left me.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.535 align:middle line:90%
My place was a mess.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:58.071 align:middle line:84%
Everything was a mess and
yet here's this dream.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.874 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I wrote to you
because it didn't make any sense

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:04.177 align:middle line:84%
that I would have this dream
in the midst of this mess."

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:06.913 align:middle line:84%
"But," she said, "But I did
what you said and like medicine,

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:10.383 align:middle line:84%
every day I meditated on
the feeling and the energy

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.652 align:middle line:84%
of this dream for a
few minutes," she said,

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.354 align:middle line:90%
"and my cancer is gone.

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:15.756 align:middle line:84%
I've been given a
clean bill of health."

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:16.523 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Gone?

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Gone.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.326 align:middle line:90%
It was as if it fell out.

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:21.628 align:middle line:84%
It dropped out and she said
"It just doesn't happen."

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:22.629 align:middle line:90%
It's a schwannoma.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:23.563 align:middle line:90%
I write about it.

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:25.031 align:middle line:90%
It's many syllables.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:28.401 align:middle line:84%
It's a tumor that just
pffff, like it fell out

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:33.473 align:middle line:84%
and she sends me pictures almost
every week of her riding horses,

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:35.942 align:middle line:84%
her with her new relationship,
running on the beach,

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:39.546 align:middle line:84%
healthiest person you've
ever seen in your life.

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:42.616 align:middle line:84%
And this has been now three
years since I received that.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's remarkable.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Yeah, and she
says that she continues.

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:49.322 align:middle line:84%
She's now past the
threat of surviving.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:52.225 align:middle line:84%
She thinks about that dream
still every day and it's

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:56.763 align:middle line:84%
like her personal access to
the Divine, to a higher realm

00:04:56.763 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and it's her own
one-of-a-kind, freshly-minted,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
just for her access that
she keeps using and it's

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.939 align:middle line:90%
like her secret success formula.

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.341 align:middle line:84%
And I would dare say
that we all have these.

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:12.078 align:middle line:84%
We all get some form of
that that we can use,

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:14.314 align:middle line:84%
that we can think about
after the fact even years

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.851 align:middle line:84%
after the fact and it can give
us a raise in energy and kind

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.921 align:middle line:84%
of a more enlightened way of
being in this world which is

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:22.622 align:middle line:90%
where it's so exciting.

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What does it mean?

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.992 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw some
examples of dreams that a lot

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:30.296 align:middle line:84%
of people have and so
this is not uncommon.

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:31.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Great.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:34.968 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: One is the dream where
you're teeth are falling out.

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Who would dream of that?

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.138 align:middle line:90%
But they do.

00:05:38.138 --> 00:05:39.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: So many people,

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:42.175 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the most
commonly remembered dreams.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:45.845 align:middle line:84%
P. S. People most
typically remember the dreams

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:49.249 align:middle line:84%
that are the most scary because
they affect us viscerally

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:51.585 align:middle line:84%
and it imprints us so that
they're a little bit easier

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:52.752 align:middle line:90%
to remember.

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:55.388 align:middle line:84%
Teeth falling out is a
horrifying experience.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.489 align:middle line:90%
I've had that before.

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:57.691 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Uh-huh.

00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.894 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: So I like to
say, here's my disclaimer.

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:02.062 align:middle line:90%
We're all unique beings.

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:84%
We all have a unique
fingerprint.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.099 align:middle line:84%
There's no one dream
interpretation that's just a pat

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.534 align:middle line:90%
answer for everybody.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.503 align:middle line:84%
However, we have so much
in common us human beings

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:13.373 align:middle line:84%
that we could look at
things archetypally and say,

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.776 align:middle line:84%
consider this as a possible
interpretation of your dream.

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:19.813 align:middle line:84%
So with that said, if it were
my dream, if I had a dream

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:22.782 align:middle line:84%
of my teeth falling out
I would think of okay--

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:23.817 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Weird.

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:25.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Well teeth
are in the mouth.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:27.787 align:middle line:84%
They're located in the mouth and
just about anything that relates

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:31.625 align:middle line:84%
to the mouth we could say
represents communication issues,

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:35.495 align:middle line:84%
so loose teeth like
loose lips sink ships,

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.097 align:middle line:90%
it's like where were you loose

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:39.032 align:middle line:84%
with your speech
earlier that day?

00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:40.667 align:middle line:84%
Where were you just
going, ah, ah, ah,

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:42.502 align:middle line:90%
gossiping about somebody?

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:45.438 align:middle line:84%
Not that anyone here would
ever do anything like that

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:48.675 align:middle line:84%
or teeth also are
what we eat with.

00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:52.045 align:middle line:84%
If we lost our teeth and we
were in the wild for example,

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't survive long, so
often teeth lost in a dream is

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.754 align:middle line:84%
about incredible stress
about survival issues.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.155 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to make it?

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:04.858 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people that have teeth
falling out dreams happen to be

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:08.261 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of a
financial pinch

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:12.065 align:middle line:84%
so that's what you could say
is a possible interpretation

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:12.832 align:middle line:90%
of that dream.

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.601 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What about falling?

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:15.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Yes, falling.

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I said once upon a
time falling can represent

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.177 align:middle line:84%
that the falling spirits
are calling you to them,

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:26.846 align:middle line:84%
that you're being
called to drop in deeper

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:29.482 align:middle line:84%
and become more grounded
and you can also say

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:32.786 align:middle line:84%
that falling might be that
things are falling apart

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.955 align:middle line:90%
and this is part of the life--

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.724 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Your life is
crumbling or something?

00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:40.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Right and
we're always in a cycle

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.529 align:middle line:90%
of life-death-life-death-life.

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:46.032 align:middle line:84%
Within our life things
get built, they fall down.

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:47.233 align:middle line:90%
They get built, they fall down.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:49.636 align:middle line:84%
So it's telling us that
things are falling apart.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:50.804 align:middle line:90%
That's not a bad thing.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.539 align:middle line:90%
If you're embracing the fact

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:55.275 align:middle line:84%
that we're always changing
then falling dreams are good.

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:57.444 align:middle line:84%
It could let you know that
you've got more on your plate.

00:07:57.444 --> 00:07:59.779 align:middle line:84%
It could let you know that
you're falling in love.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.915 align:middle line:84%
You get overwhelmed
when you fall in love.

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:03.116 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Something really
good having an avalanche

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.686 align:middle line:84%
of great things in your
life can also cause you

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:07.721 align:middle line:90%
to feel overwhelmed.

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:09.322 align:middle line:84%
Too many people coming
to your house

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.291 align:middle line:84%
when you don't want
too big of a party.

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:11.958 align:middle line:90%
It's too much.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.093 align:middle line:90%
You can't handle it.

00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:15.095 align:middle line:84%
So the dream is telling
you get some support.

00:08:15.095 --> 00:08:16.129 align:middle line:90%
Get some help.

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Get organized.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.832 align:middle line:90%
Get grounded.

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:22.502 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Is a dream a
mechanism to protect you

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.337 align:middle line:90%
in your physical life?

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Ummm.

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:26.973 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:28.041 align:middle line:90%
It certainly can be.

00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.008 align:middle line:90%
I look at dreams from kind

00:08:30.008 --> 00:08:32.812 align:middle line:84%
of the ordinary survival
perspective

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:35.115 align:middle line:84%
and then the thriving
perspective.

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:38.818 align:middle line:84%
So cavemen wrote their
dreams down on cave walls

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:41.354 align:middle line:84%
and often those hieroglyphics
are

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:45.792 align:middle line:84%
about big animals chasing them
and how to protect themselves.

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:48.495 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a dream
that something bad is going

00:08:48.495 --> 00:08:51.364 align:middle line:84%
to happen the next day consider
that that's also a blessing

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.334 align:middle line:84%
because it gives you,
you've received a preview

00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:56.736 align:middle line:84%
of coming events or
possible coming events

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:59.906 align:middle line:84%
so that you can position
yourself more advantageously

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:03.376 align:middle line:84%
so should it happen
you've rehearsed this.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.078 align:middle line:84%
You already know what you're
going to do, where you're going

00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:06.312 align:middle line:84%
to go, how you're
going to handle this

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:07.547 align:middle line:90%
and what you're going to say.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.182 align:middle line:90%
So that's a really good thing.

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:10.683 align:middle line:90%
It's better than not having that

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:12.852 align:middle line:84%
and just being blindsided
out of the blue.

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:15.488 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes having these
dreams, they could be scary

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:19.159 align:middle line:84%
but I always look for how is
this a blessing in my life

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and how can I use
it in that way?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.565 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Outside of sleep apnea
some people wake up exhausted

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.034 align:middle line:84%
and let's take the
medical condition

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:29.469 align:middle line:90%
out of it for the moment.

00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:33.406 align:middle line:84%
If it's merely tied to
the subconscious mind,

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:37.677 align:middle line:84%
to the dream state why are they
so tired when they wake up?

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:38.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Well, there's
a lot of people

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:41.581 align:middle line:84%
and I would dare say the
people that watch your show

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:90%
and listen to your radio show--

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:44.684 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: -- are insomniacs.

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: -- are insomniacs
but they're also people

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that live a somewhat
alternative lifestyle

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.294 align:middle line:84%
and are living outside
the box and they may be,

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:58.398 align:middle line:84%
there's a few people I know that
have sent me dreams about being

00:09:58.398 --> 00:10:02.669 align:middle line:84%
on crafts, being, having,
exploring other dimensions

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:05.705 align:middle line:84%
in their dreams and of course
they would wake up exhausted

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:08.041 align:middle line:84%
because they've been
working really hard.

00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:11.811 align:middle line:84%
They've been exploring other
species or being explored

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.447 align:middle line:84%
and that would leave
a person exhausted.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.217 align:middle line:84%
So if you wake up exhausted
it means you've probably been

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:19.152 align:middle line:84%
really active in
your waking state

00:10:19.152 --> 00:10:21.754 align:middle line:84%
and give yourself a break
the next day to recalibrate.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:23.957 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Should you get
checked out medically too just

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:24.724 align:middle line:90%
to be on the safe side?

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:25.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: It doesn't hurt.

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:26.526 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah. I always say cover--

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: A lot of people
have apnea.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.328 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:30.497 align:middle line:90%
Cover that base for sure.

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:32.899 align:middle line:90%
I'm assuming people sort of do.

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:90%
Cover that base and then get

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.269 align:middle line:84%
into the metaphysical
explanations.

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:39.139 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: When you started
studying dreams in the beginning

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:42.275 align:middle line:84%
and you go all the way back
when you were a little child

00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:48.615 align:middle line:84%
but as you grew to your
adult stage did you--

00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Wait a second
you're saying I'm an adult?

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah, you're an adult.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: What?

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:55.088 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Did you witness
precognitive dreams

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:56.189 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Uh-huh.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:57.991 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Lucid dreaming?

00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.425 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the difference of those.

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:00.827 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Oh,

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:04.497 align:middle line:84%
well a precognitive dream you
don't know it's a precognitive

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.467 align:middle line:84%
until something shows up in
your waking world the next day

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:10.403 align:middle line:84%
or soon thereafter that is
a reflection of something

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:13.306 align:middle line:84%
that you dreamt about and the
only way you really have proof

00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:15.575 align:middle line:84%
is if you've written it down
which I highly recommend.

00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:17.944 align:middle line:84%
There are great dream
apps that you can use.

00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:20.547 align:middle line:84%
I use a free dream app
called Dreams Cloud.

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Document those dreams because
you might second guess yourself.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.585 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: If something
happens there they are.

00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:26.719 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:29.155 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Absolutely,
so precognitive dream,

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:30.390 align:middle line:90%
if people are really good

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.892 align:middle line:84%
at them one way you know
it's a precognitive dream is

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:35.895 align:middle line:84%
because it comes in a
particular repeatable way,

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:38.731 align:middle line:84%
like for example, there's
a few guys that I know,

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:40.099 align:middle line:90%
there's these guys that work

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:42.969 align:middle line:84%
on a project called The
Lucid Dreaming Project

00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:45.338 align:middle line:84%
and they met each other
because of the synchronicity

00:11:45.338 --> 00:11:48.308 align:middle line:84%
around every time they would
have a precognitive dream it

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:50.343 align:middle line:84%
would take place
in a movie theater.

00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:53.212 align:middle line:84%
So pretty sure if they
woke up and they had been

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:56.416 align:middle line:84%
in a movie theater in
their dream they would tend

00:11:56.416 --> 00:12:00.053 align:middle line:84%
to think okay this
was predictive.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.088 align:middle line:90%
So if you get good at this

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:05.258 align:middle line:84%
and you've tracked your dreams
you've become the anthropologist

00:12:05.258 --> 00:12:07.994 align:middle line:84%
of your own dreams in your own
life then you know what the

00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:09.329 align:middle line:90%
telltale signs are.

00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:12.231 align:middle line:84%
One woman always has
a Franciscan monk

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:90%
that shows up and he's hooded.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.203 align:middle line:84%
She can't see his face but
when he shows up she knows,

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:20.773 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, listen
to what he says.

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:23.176 align:middle line:90%
Do not second guess this man

00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:26.546 align:middle line:84%
because there's always
something important that he says

00:12:26.546 --> 00:12:30.049 align:middle line:84%
that relates to what's going
on in her life in things

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:32.118 align:middle line:90%
that haven't happened yet.

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:35.622 align:middle line:84%
Lucid dreaming, very different
although you could say

00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:37.724 align:middle line:90%
if you become aware enough

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:39.859 align:middle line:84%
that you're having
precognitive dreams that means

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:42.328 align:middle line:84%
that you're aware that
you're dreaming in the dream.

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:45.331 align:middle line:84%
Then you can use that as a
springboard for lucid dreaming.

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:48.167 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes and here's one of the
blessings in disguise for people

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.403 align:middle line:84%
that have scary dreams,
regular nightmares

00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:51.537 align:middle line:84%
that take place that
are similar--

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:52.805 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Night terrors, right?

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:54.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Night terrors or
nightmares that take place

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:56.943 align:middle line:90%
in a similar dreamscape.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.545 align:middle line:84%
If you know I'm always
running down a hallway

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:02.315 align:middle line:84%
when this scary thing
comes racing after me,

00:13:02.315 --> 00:13:06.486 align:middle line:84%
you know this hallway is a
sign that you're dreaming.

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to people
and I've people do this now.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.291 align:middle line:84%
The next time you're
in a hallway even

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.494 align:middle line:84%
if you're running
remember this is a dream.

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.229 align:middle line:84%
Turn around and do
something different.

00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:18.564 align:middle line:84%
If you're lucid dreaming
and you're the director

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:20.199 align:middle line:84%
of your dream, some people
do have a lucid dream

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.735 align:middle line:84%
but they freeze and they
don't know what to do.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:25.638 align:middle line:84%
It's like now that I'm
lucid what am I going to do,

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.074 align:middle line:84%
have sex with somebody,
have a million dollars?

00:13:28.074 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
But prepare where
you want to go.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.212 align:middle line:84%
Is there another planet
you want to explore?

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Is there a departed loved one?

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.015 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to hang
out with Elvis?

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:39.519 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to find out
why your father left you?

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to, I mean
what do you want to find

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.623 align:middle line:84%
out once you're in
that wonderful--

00:13:43.623 --> 00:13:45.491 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Can you do
that in a lucid dream?

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Absolutely.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.061 align:middle line:90%
And it helps if you're prepared.

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:49.962 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: See I always thought a
lucid dream was you could just

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.998 align:middle line:90%
change the outcome of the dream.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.067 align:middle line:90%
So if you're dreaming of going

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:56.803 align:middle line:84%
on a cruise you can
change the direction

00:13:56.803 --> 00:13:58.404 align:middle line:84%
of where you want
to go for example.

00:13:58.404 --> 00:13:59.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Sure.

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:03.376 align:middle line:84%
It helps in some way to rehearse
it unless you're such an expert.

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:04.977 align:middle line:84%
There are some people
that are so good.

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:06.813 align:middle line:84%
Just like the dancers
on "Dancing

00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:09.248 align:middle line:84%
With the Stars" are not ordinary
dancers there are some people

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:11.517 align:middle line:84%
that are like lucid
dreaming with the stars.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
They're just so good they
can go anywhere, do anything,

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
go backwards, forward,
heal multiple people.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.225 align:middle line:90%
They can do whatever they want.

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:22.795 align:middle line:84%
That's amazing and I bow to
those people and thank God

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:24.197 align:middle line:90%
that they're on the planet.

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:84%
But for the average person it
is about changing the dream,

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.104 align:middle line:84%
being aware that you're
dreaming but if you have a sense

00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:33.106 align:middle line:84%
that okay, I'm going to
practice lucid dreaming tonight.

00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:36.109 align:middle line:84%
What do I want to do, so
that you're not just frozen

00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:39.011 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know and you
do something silly like,

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:43.216 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to kiss somebody or
run through a wall which is fine

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.018 align:middle line:84%
but if you have that opportunity
you could go anywhere,

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:47.587 align:middle line:90%
do anything.

00:14:47.587 --> 00:14:49.021 align:middle line:90%
Take advantage of it.

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:52.492 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You've said a little
bit that some dreaming might be

00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:55.394 align:middle line:90%
like an American Express card.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:57.396 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:59.766 align:middle line:90%
At my limit or what?

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:01.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Don't leave
home without it.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:02.869 align:middle line:90%
No, George.

00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:05.338 align:middle line:84%
It's don't leave
home without it.

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:09.041 align:middle line:84%
There's some indigenous cultures
that would say if you came

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:90%
to the morning dream circle

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:84%
without a dream you would get
dirty looks from everybody

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.317 align:middle line:84%
and the tribal elder would look
at you and say, "Go back to bed.

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:22.288 align:middle line:84%
How dare you wake up and
be a part of this community

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:23.923 align:middle line:90%
without a remembered dream.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.359 align:middle line:90%
How irresponsible of you.

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:29.028 align:middle line:84%
So go back, get your dream and
then you're welcome to come back

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:90%
and have some breakfast."

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.932 align:middle line:84%
So I think it would be
really great and I'm kind

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of on the bandwagon
to create a movement

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.435 align:middle line:84%
where we treat our
dreams like that.

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:38.771 align:middle line:84%
Where we wouldn't got out of the
house without brushing our teeth

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.873 align:middle line:84%
or if we have an
American Express card it's

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:43.142 align:middle line:84%
in our wallet we don't
leave home without it,

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:44.677 align:middle line:84%
so we should treat
our dreams this way.

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:49.415 align:middle line:84%
At least one dream per day that
we have in our consciousness.

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:51.717 align:middle line:84%
We meditate on it a little bit
in the morning and we carry it

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:55.588 align:middle line:84%
into our day, into our
waking lives and watch

00:15:55.588 --> 00:15:58.057 align:middle line:90%
for the dream synchronicities.

00:15:58.057 --> 00:16:02.061 align:middle line:84%
Watch for things to happen
that are truly magical

00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:03.529 align:middle line:90%
and beautiful and wonderful.

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:84%
It gives us an added
advantage and we can use that.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: There's a lot

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.069 align:middle line:84%
of challenges going
on in this world.

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:11.571 align:middle line:84%
We can use all the
help we can get

00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:15.308 align:middle line:84%
and we've got this wisdom that's
pouring in every night and most

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:19.612 align:middle line:84%
of the time we say, nah, I don't
need it, but we do actually.

00:16:19.612 --> 00:16:22.114 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do you enjoy doing
dream interpretations?

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:25.117 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: I get such a thrill.

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:28.321 align:middle line:84%
I get such a thrill because
I've always been the type

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:31.624 align:middle line:84%
that would love to get--
I feel like time is short.

00:16:31.624 --> 00:16:35.528 align:middle line:84%
Our life is short so I want to
have every interaction I have

00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:38.231 align:middle line:84%
with a person like I'm having
with you, I want it to count.

00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:39.899 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to just
talk about the weather,

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:41.634 align:middle line:84%
even though the weather can
be interesting depending

00:16:41.634 --> 00:16:43.102 align:middle line:90%
on where in the world you are.

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:47.139 align:middle line:84%
But when we talk about dreams
we're actually speaking

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.441 align:middle line:90%
from our soul.

00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:52.644 align:middle line:84%
It's soul to soul instantly,
so even among strangers--

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:55.114 align:middle line:84%
I've been at cocktail parties
where I didn't know a soul.

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:57.482 align:middle line:84%
Somebody introduces
me as the dream lady

00:16:57.482 --> 00:16:58.985 align:middle line:84%
and people start
telling me their dreams

00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:00.318 align:middle line:90%
and then they start crying.

00:17:00.318 --> 00:17:03.756 align:middle line:84%
They start revealing and it's
like in a second all ego,

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:07.692 align:middle line:84%
pretense is gone and it's
heart to heart, soul to soul.

00:17:07.692 --> 00:17:10.028 align:middle line:84%
And everyone who's there
watching is part of that

00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:13.865 align:middle line:84%
and to me it's so satisfying to
get to relate to people that way

00:17:13.865 --> 00:17:15.601 align:middle line:84%
and to have people--
it's like my calling card

00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:18.304 align:middle line:84%
that invites people to
strip off their masks,

00:17:18.304 --> 00:17:19.605 align:middle line:90%
strip off their ego,

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:21.774 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily their
clothes, although that's fine.

00:17:21.774 --> 00:17:23.042 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That happens.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: That does happen
but to connect like this,

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:28.714 align:middle line:84%
it's like ah, every
day is precious

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:90%
and it's one way to get in.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:84%
If we were a more enlightened
species we would just always

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.122 align:middle line:84%
relate to each other soul
to soul, heart to heart,

00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:39.292 align:middle line:84%
spirit to spirit but this
is kind of a way to get

00:17:39.292 --> 00:17:41.527 align:middle line:84%
in before we're all
that enlightened.

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:43.229 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do you get hassled
when you're at parties

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.398 align:middle line:90%
because people know what you do?

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:46.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: I love it.

00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:49.902 align:middle line:84%
I never, people will say,
oh, it's like being a doctor

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.704 align:middle line:84%
and somebody telling you
that their shoulder hurts,

00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:53.606 align:middle line:90%
to me it's not like that.

00:17:53.606 --> 00:17:55.841 align:middle line:90%
It's my favorite topic.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I never get bored with it.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.813 align:middle line:84%
I can hear dreams that relate to
each other and that are similar

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:03.516 align:middle line:84%
but I never hear the
same dream twice.

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:08.788 align:middle line:84%
And to me I could cry how moving
it is to me because it's really,

00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:13.492 align:middle line:84%
dream work is soul work and
it puts me more in my soul.

00:18:13.492 --> 00:18:14.894 align:middle line:84%
I feel like if there
was a problem

00:18:14.894 --> 00:18:18.497 align:middle line:84%
that this world has it's
a lack of soulfulness.

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:21.634 align:middle line:84%
That's why Native Americans
talk about soul retrieval.

00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:25.404 align:middle line:84%
Dream work is soul retrieval so
that we can get our souls back

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:29.809 align:middle line:84%
in these bodies and then work
on growing the soul and then

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:32.244 align:middle line:84%
when our soul grows
it's like, ah,

00:18:32.244 --> 00:18:34.847 align:middle line:90%
we become, life becomes magical.

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:38.084 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Why do we
have nightmares?

00:18:38.084 --> 00:18:39.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: There's many
different reasons.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:40.886 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's very personal

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:42.788 align:middle line:84%
because there's unresolved
conflict.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.056 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Things happening to us.

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Right, traumas
that we've and there's a lot

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:84%
of people that I know that
have post traumatic stress.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.028 align:middle line:90%
They have been through war.

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:50.162 align:middle line:90%
I just met with some guys

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:52.431 align:middle line:84%
from the Wounded Warrior
Project yesterday.

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Truly a serious
affliction.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: My God, a black
ops guy who was blown up

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:59.605 align:middle line:84%
and everyone with him
died except for him.

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:01.107 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And he sees all this.

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:03.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Right, so one way is
the dreams are helping us to try

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.345 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how to make
sense of this, how to grapple

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.547 align:middle line:84%
with this and how
to put it somewhere

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:11.017 align:middle line:84%
so that the psychologically
we can be more

00:19:11.017 --> 00:19:12.985 align:middle line:90%
at peace with what's going on.

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:16.288 align:middle line:84%
Now there's some people
however, and I met one guy

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:19.225 align:middle line:84%
in Isla Mujeres, Mexico
who is a tattoo artist.

00:19:19.225 --> 00:19:23.896 align:middle line:84%
You'd never expect, covered
in tattoos, the sweetest soul.

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the most enlightened
glowing beings I've ever seen

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.036 align:middle line:84%
and he has nightmares
every night and he believes

00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:31.437 align:middle line:84%
that he's helping
to heal the people

00:19:31.437 --> 00:19:33.839 align:middle line:84%
in his community based
on these nightmares.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.508 align:middle line:84%
It's not his own
personal issues.

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.009 align:middle line:90%
It's transpersonal.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:39.445 align:middle line:84%
So some people if they're are
having really bad dreams it's

00:19:39.445 --> 00:19:41.747 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily a
mark against them

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:84%
that anything wrong happened to
them it may be that you're doing

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.287 align:middle line:84%
so well that you're the
sacrificial lamb that's helping

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:49.922 align:middle line:90%
to heal the world.

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:52.825 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's talk about
the ability in our dreams

00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:56.996 align:middle line:84%
to change our lives by
concentrating on something

00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:59.265 align:middle line:90%
and having it actually happen.

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:00.433 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:02.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Well, if there's
something beautiful,

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:04.837 align:middle line:84%
I mean here's one example
that happened to me.

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:05.971 align:middle line:90%
May I share a personal?

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:07.339 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes you may.

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:09.208 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: I didn't set out for
this to happen but I had one

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.911 align:middle line:84%
of the most wonderful
dreams of my life.

00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:15.347 align:middle line:84%
Long story short, I'm
swimming with dolphins.

00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:19.652 align:middle line:84%
I call it dolphin celebration
and I write about it in detail

00:20:19.652 --> 00:20:23.022 align:middle line:84%
in my book but I'm having this
party with these dolphins.

00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:28.327 align:middle line:84%
One dolphin is enough to
make me over the top with joy

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:31.397 align:middle line:84%
but a whole pod of them
and a whole ocean full

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:35.868 align:middle line:84%
of them was like, oh my God,
so I'm weeping in the dream

00:20:35.868 --> 00:20:39.004 align:middle line:84%
with joy and then I become
one of them and I'm swimming

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:42.408 align:middle line:84%
with them at the speed of
light and I'm realizing--

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:45.044 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Are you holding on to
them or are you doing the--

00:20:45.044 --> 00:20:46.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: No, no I'm with them.

00:20:46.312 --> 00:20:46.979 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of them.

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:48.447 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of the pod.

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:49.882 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:52.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: And I'm realizing
we're all uniquely expressed and

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:53.853 align:middle line:90%
yet we're all connected.

00:20:53.853 --> 00:20:58.157 align:middle line:84%
This is an imprint of how to
flow and how to be in community

00:20:58.157 --> 00:21:00.659 align:middle line:84%
with one another in a
way that's intuitive.

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:05.231 align:middle line:84%
I woke up from that dream
and I have contact lenses

00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:06.732 align:middle line:90%
so my contacts were blurry.

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:09.201 align:middle line:84%
I went and I rinsed them out
and they were still blurry

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:11.704 align:middle line:84%
and I still couldn't see
very well, put in a new pair

00:21:11.704 --> 00:21:13.506 align:middle line:84%
of contacts because
they were still blurry.

00:21:13.506 --> 00:21:15.441 align:middle line:90%
Those contacts were blurry,

00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:17.176 align:middle line:84%
went to the eye doctor
a few days later

00:21:17.176 --> 00:21:17.910 align:middle line:90%
because I need to see.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:18.511 align:middle line:90%
I'm a writer.

00:21:18.511 --> 00:21:20.379 align:middle line:90%
I need to see.

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't see for three days.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.182 align:middle line:84%
Went to the eye doctor,
figured that I need

00:21:23.182 --> 00:21:25.251 align:middle line:90%
to get a stronger prescription.

00:21:25.251 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that my
eyes had improved

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.423 align:middle line:84%
so drastically overnight
that the prescription

00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:33.726 align:middle line:84%
that I was wearing was
causing my eyes to blur.

00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.228 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: And he kept checking.

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:37.696 align:middle line:90%
He kept me in there all day.

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:39.198 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: He had no idea
how this happened.

00:21:39.198 --> 00:21:40.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: This never happens.

00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:42.535 align:middle line:84%
People with eyes
get worse over time.

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:45.371 align:middle line:84%
Just like our health
declines over time.

00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:47.406 align:middle line:90%
No, not necessarily.

00:21:47.406 --> 00:21:50.442 align:middle line:84%
These dreams that we have
sometimes can have us age

00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:53.412 align:middle line:84%
backwards, can put us into
better health than we were

00:21:53.412 --> 00:21:55.447 align:middle line:84%
in before we went
to sleep that night.

00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:57.449 align:middle line:90%
It happens all the time.

00:21:57.449 --> 00:21:59.051 align:middle line:84%
It helps to remember
those dreams.

00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:02.087 align:middle line:84%
You can work with the energy
of them and keep it going.

00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:03.989 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Can you change
your attitude in a dream?

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.891 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
people are upset.

00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:07.326 align:middle line:90%
They are depressed.

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:08.794 align:middle line:90%
Things are happening.

00:22:08.794 --> 00:22:11.297 align:middle line:90%
Can you fix yourself that way?

00:22:11.297 --> 00:22:13.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: So many
times and again,

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:90%
this is about remembered dreams.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.502 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like breathing.

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:18.204 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to know that
we're breathing to know

00:22:18.204 --> 00:22:19.738 align:middle line:90%
that we benefit from it.

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:21.073 align:middle line:90%
It's an autonomic function.

00:22:21.073 --> 00:22:22.474 align:middle line:90%
That's the same with our dreams.

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:25.878 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to remember them
in order to benefit from them.

00:22:25.878 --> 00:22:27.479 align:middle line:84%
So many good things
are happening to us

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:29.515 align:middle line:84%
because of the dreams
that we forgot all about.

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:31.483 align:middle line:90%
However, if we're aware

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:33.619 align:middle line:84%
that we're breathing we
can take a deep breath

00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:35.988 align:middle line:84%
and we can modulate
a little differently.

00:22:35.988 --> 00:22:37.957 align:middle line:84%
If we can remember
that we're dreaming

00:22:37.957 --> 00:22:42.728 align:middle line:84%
and remember a dream then we can
add exponential work to that.

00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
We can benefit from
it exponentially

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:49.301 align:middle line:84%
so there's people I know that
have been in long-term feuds

00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:51.103 align:middle line:84%
with one another,
like a family feud.

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:53.205 align:middle line:84%
Unforgivable things
have happened

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:56.141 align:middle line:84%
and then they have a
remembered dream that they

00:22:56.141 --> 00:23:00.846 align:middle line:84%
in the dream were the person
that they were so mad at.

00:23:00.846 --> 00:23:04.149 align:middle line:84%
They got to, in a sense, walk
20 miles in their moccasins

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:05.284 align:middle line:90%
in the dream and they woke

00:23:05.284 --> 00:23:08.554 align:middle line:84%
up realizing this is why
they were so mad at me.

00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:10.856 align:middle line:84%
This is why they
did what they did.

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:13.926 align:middle line:84%
Compassion, instant
compassion that nothing else

00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:15.327 align:middle line:84%
in this world would
have given them

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:18.297 align:middle line:84%
and then there's they have the
olive branch and they're able

00:23:18.297 --> 00:23:20.032 align:middle line:84%
to make amends because
of something

00:23:20.032 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:90%
that happens in a dream.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.369 align:middle line:84%
I hear that all the
time as well.

00:23:23.369 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to hear about
it more often when it comes

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.107 align:middle line:84%
to countries feuding with
one another but if it happens

00:23:28.107 --> 00:23:30.242 align:middle line:84%
on the individual level
there is a ripple effect

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:31.377 align:middle line:90%
that goes out from there.

00:23:31.377 --> 00:23:32.911 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You do interesting work.

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:34.113 align:middle line:90%
You really do.

00:23:34.113 --> 00:23:35.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Thank you.

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:36.815 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You talk a
little bit about how

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:41.654 align:middle line:84%
in your dream state you can
heal yourself from afflictions.

00:23:41.654 --> 00:23:45.691 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure, God forbid if
I came down with the big C,

00:23:45.691 --> 00:23:48.494 align:middle line:84%
if I wouldn't listen
to doctors as well.

00:23:48.494 --> 00:23:49.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Right.

00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But there are
some gutsy people

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.899 align:middle line:84%
who will do what they
do in your dream state.

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:55.134 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:23:55.134 --> 00:23:59.138 align:middle line:84%
How do your dreams
heal yourself?

00:23:59.138 --> 00:24:00.539 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Part of
it is the dream.

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:03.742 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is what you do with
the dream in your waking state

00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:06.312 align:middle line:84%
so there's a woman named Kathy
Canacus [assumed spelling]

00:24:06.312 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:90%
that I write about any book

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.915 align:middle line:84%
and I've interviewed
her extensively.

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:12.584 align:middle line:90%
She had just had a mammogram

00:24:12.584 --> 00:24:14.019 align:middle line:84%
and was given a clean
bill of health.

00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:17.723 align:middle line:84%
Everything was perfect, fine,
fabulous, but she has a dream.

00:24:17.723 --> 00:24:19.525 align:middle line:90%
The Franciscan monk shows up.

00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:20.793 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:23.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: And he points at
a place on her left breast

00:24:23.696 --> 00:24:26.699 align:middle line:84%
on the underside and
says, "You've got cancer."

00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:28.033 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: In the dream?

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:29.301 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: In the dream and
she was like, "Wait a second.

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:31.236 align:middle line:84%
I was so happy that
I was-- I am healthy.

00:24:31.236 --> 00:24:31.904 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine."

00:24:31.904 --> 00:24:33.005 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, "No."

00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:35.207 align:middle line:84%
So she goes back to
the doctors and says,

00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:37.209 align:middle line:84%
"I need to get another
mammogram."

00:24:37.209 --> 00:24:39.812 align:middle line:84%
Still the mammogram doesn't
show up with anything.

00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:40.579 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Wow.

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: She gets an MRI.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.483 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't show up but she
keeps having the dream.

00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:45.584 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Wow.

00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:46.585 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor must
think enough is enough.

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:47.987 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: She's crazy.

00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:50.255 align:middle line:84%
Her husband, everyone is saying,
"Honey you're a healthy woman.

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:52.758 align:middle line:84%
Enjoy it. Do you know how
many people would be so happy

00:24:52.758 --> 00:24:54.393 align:middle line:84%
to be told that they have
a clean bill of health.

00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:56.128 align:middle line:90%
Go home. Enjoy yourself."

00:24:56.128 --> 00:24:57.696 align:middle line:90%
But she keeps having this dream.

00:24:57.696 --> 00:25:02.634 align:middle line:84%
Finally she insists on
getting exploratory surgery

00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:03.736 align:middle line:90%
even though--

00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:07.206 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Whoa, what doctor
would do that, huh?

00:25:07.206 --> 00:25:09.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: The monk told her in
the dream I will be with you

00:25:09.475 --> 00:25:11.243 align:middle line:84%
and he actually hands
her a feather.

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:15.948 align:middle line:84%
He said to her, "Walk in
holding this imaginary feather

00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:18.384 align:middle line:84%
and you'll have the
authority to claim."

00:25:18.384 --> 00:25:20.853 align:middle line:90%
So they do exploratory surgery.

00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:23.989 align:middle line:90%
Sure enough, stage three cancer.

00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:24.823 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: How did they miss that?

00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:25.858 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: How did they miss it?

00:25:25.858 --> 00:25:26.992 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:28.527 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I'm covered
in chills as I say this.

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:29.795 align:middle line:90%
It happens all the time.

00:25:29.795 --> 00:25:32.531 align:middle line:84%
And Kathy is now a big
advocate for people getting MRIs

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.266 align:middle line:90%
and having actual x-rays.

00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:35.768 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Obviously
they didn't work.

00:25:35.768 --> 00:25:36.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Well, sometimes,

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:38.203 align:middle line:84%
I mean they work better
than than mammograms.

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:41.273 align:middle line:84%
Most mammograms miss
so much but that dream,

00:25:41.273 --> 00:25:45.744 align:middle line:84%
she's a three time
breast cancer survivor.

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:48.981 align:middle line:84%
She's had a double mastectomy
but if you saw her today

00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:50.883 align:middle line:84%
and she walked in here you'd
think she was the picture

00:25:50.883 --> 00:25:51.517 align:middle line:90%
of health.

00:25:51.517 --> 00:25:52.584 align:middle line:90%
She's doing great.

00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:53.919 align:middle line:90%
She's alive and well.

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:56.555 align:middle line:84%
She's writing her own book
called "Surviving Cancer Land."

00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's one example.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.894 align:middle line:84%
I've got others too but
it's really important.

00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:04.863 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So the body can
be healed by your dreams

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.899 align:middle line:90%
or you get these messages.

00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:08.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: If you, I
mean basically it comes

00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:10.169 align:middle line:90%
down to the word respect.

00:26:10.169 --> 00:26:13.472 align:middle line:84%
I think about Aretha
Franklin, R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:16.341 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't respect their
dreams in the western world

00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:19.812 align:middle line:84%
because when we remember them
they seem so cryptic and so hard

00:26:19.812 --> 00:26:22.748 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we kind
of discard them and put them

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:26.251 align:middle line:84%
in the unsolved mysteries
heap and move on.

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:30.222 align:middle line:84%
But if we respect them, if
we have a deep respect even

00:26:30.222 --> 00:26:34.626 align:middle line:84%
if we don't understand them then
we'll begin to get a little bit

00:26:34.626 --> 00:26:36.962 align:middle line:84%
of a download into what they
mean and how to work with them.

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And even if we don't
know what to do

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.133 align:middle line:84%
with them you can do what's
called dream tending which is

00:26:41.133 --> 00:26:43.469 align:middle line:84%
where you hang out with the
dream like it's a buddy.

00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:45.871 align:middle line:84%
You're just hanging out with
it even though your like,

00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't get you but we're going
to spend some time together

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:84%
and eventually through
osmosis you'll start

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.712 align:middle line:84%
to have an ah-ha moment about
what the dream was telling you.

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:56.682 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: In the dream state a
lot of people have thought

00:26:56.682 --> 00:27:01.353 align:middle line:84%
of being abducted by aliens
and taken to UFOs and crafts.

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:04.523 align:middle line:84%
Do you get some of that in
your hypnotherapy sessions?

00:27:04.523 --> 00:27:05.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Oh yeah.

00:27:05.924 --> 00:27:10.462 align:middle line:84%
I get quite a bit of that and
I like to look at every dream

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:13.765 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective
of look at it literally

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:16.869 align:middle line:84%
and then look at
it metaphysically.

00:27:16.869 --> 00:27:18.604 align:middle line:84%
Look at it from all
different perspective,

00:27:18.604 --> 00:27:20.939 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective that
everyone in the dream is us.

00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:24.743 align:middle line:84%
What could be most alien
to us is our own power

00:27:24.743 --> 00:27:28.213 align:middle line:84%
and for some their true
self so consider looking

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:29.982 align:middle line:84%
at it symbolically,
that it could be that.

00:27:29.982 --> 00:27:32.651 align:middle line:84%
In other cases, I think
it could be quite physical

00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:34.219 align:middle line:90%
or quite literal.

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:35.787 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Something could
have happened to them.

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:37.122 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:38.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Well certainly,
certainly and there's one story

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:41.326 align:middle line:84%
about a woman who, I mean
there's so many stories

00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:43.061 align:middle line:84%
about people that
dream of being abducted

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:47.099 align:middle line:84%
and having a whole life spent
where they're either running

00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:49.601 align:middle line:84%
from the aliens or making
love with the aliens

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:52.037 align:middle line:84%
or befriending them and
learning things from them.

00:27:52.037 --> 00:27:56.542 align:middle line:84%
And in every case, I'd say just
about every case, they come back

00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:59.111 align:middle line:84%
into the waking state a bit
different than they were

00:27:59.111 --> 00:28:00.312 align:middle line:84%
when they went to
sleep that night.

00:28:00.312 --> 00:28:03.415 align:middle line:84%
I would say most of the
time better than they were

00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:04.750 align:middle line:90%
when they went to sleep.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.652 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Then they have the
recollection in the dream state?

00:28:06.652 --> 00:28:09.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: Yes and however,
there are some that say okay,

00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:84%
there are some negative
entities out there.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.792 align:middle line:84%
How do I protect myself
from those things?

00:28:13.792 --> 00:28:16.528 align:middle line:84%
There are many things
that you can do.

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.362 align:middle line:90%
You can pray.

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:18.797 align:middle line:90%
You can get some dream candles.

00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:21.333 align:middle line:84%
You can call on a power
[inaudible] or you can call

00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:23.969 align:middle line:84%
on your archangels or
your angels before you go

00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:25.737 align:middle line:90%
to sleep to protect yourself.

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:27.205 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many
things you can do

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:90%
to protect your dream zone

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.476 align:middle line:84%
so if you don't want
these people showing up

00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:33.011 align:middle line:84%
or these beings showing
up and I don't

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:36.815 align:middle line:84%
like where they're taking you
then you're not a victim of this

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:39.151 align:middle line:84%
or I don't have to be
after the first time.

00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:40.352 align:middle line:90%
You can protect yourself.

00:28:40.352 --> 00:28:42.621 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I just love how
people describe the inside

00:28:42.621 --> 00:28:47.759 align:middle line:84%
of the craft, what these
ETs look like and I mean.

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:50.462 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure some of them
may be creating this

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:52.898 align:middle line:84%
in their dream state
but others may have gone

00:28:52.898 --> 00:28:55.734 align:middle line:84%
through some kind
of real experience.

00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:58.303 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: I believe yeah,
I believe it is hybrid.

00:28:58.303 --> 00:28:59.938 align:middle line:90%
It's some of each.

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:01.173 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: As a matter of
fact if people want

00:29:01.173 --> 00:29:02.708 align:middle line:84%
to reach you how
do they get to you?

00:29:02.708 --> 00:29:04.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: They can get
to me through my website

00:29:04.443 --> 00:29:07.746 align:middle line:84%
which is easiest,
most easily found

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:12.017 align:middle line:90%
at Ihadthestrangestdream.com.

00:29:12.017 --> 00:29:13.952 align:middle line:84%
>> GN:
Ihadthestrangestdream.com.

00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:17.289 align:middle line:84%
Here it is, right here
with Kelly Sullivan Walden.

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:20.325 align:middle line:84%
Kelly, thank you so much
for giving us the feedback

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:23.962 align:middle line:84%
and the input into what a
dream is and how it works.

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:24.997 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:29:24.997 --> 00:29:25.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: It's such
a pleasure George.

00:29:25.998 --> 00:29:26.999 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Thank you.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.667 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:29.501 align:middle line:90%
It's been wonderful.

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:30.602 align:middle line:90%
Quite dreamy.

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:31.637 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Dream.

00:29:31.637 --> 00:29:34.272 align:middle line:90%
It's worth it.

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:50.489 align:middle line:90%
