>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to this edition

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.240 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:10%
Bonni McCliss is with us,
a certified hypnotherapist

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:10%
and psychic medium, who
specializes in tapping

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:10%
into the Akashic Records.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Bonni, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BONNI MCCLISS: Hi, George.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how are you?

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I'm doing well.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lots to
talk with you about.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Definitely.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about your
life as a psychic medium.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.890 align:middle line:90%
How did that start for you?

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Sure.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it definitely evolved.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:10%
It definitely evolved
from this idea of psychic

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:10%
in a myriad of different ways.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And it came to this fruition
of reading the Akashic Records.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's been a journey.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How old were you?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.880 align:middle line:10%
>>MCCLISS: My earliest memories
with working within the psychic

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.680 align:middle line:10%
plane--

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:10%
I was about two years old.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah, that's it.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It's as far
back as I could go.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it hereditary?

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.928 align:middle line:90%
Is it in your family?

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Not to my knowledge.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not hereditary.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it had something to
do with the vibrational beings

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.675 align:middle line:84%
or access that came
upon me early on,

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and it's a bit of a
chicken or the egg.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I attracted
this help by being psychic,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:84%
or if I came in, contracted
into higher planes, beings,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and states of consciousness.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know, but they've
been around for as long

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.780 align:middle line:90%
as I can remember.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.155 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, being so young
to have this ability, where

00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:43.270 align:middle line:90%
you were a brainiac in school?

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Quite
the opposite, yeah.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:84%
It was very much a
problem, misunderstood.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Yes, kind of didn't
process things the way

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.670 align:middle line:84%
that other people
processed them.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Classic-- she's a daydreamer.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.220 align:middle line:84%
We can't keep Bonni's
focus for long.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were in
another plane of existence.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I was classic, yeah.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
If anybody knew me back then,
they'd say, oh, she's not here.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
the Akashic Records?

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: The Akashic Records--

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.170 align:middle line:84%
many people believe different
things about the Akasha.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
But from my perspective,
it's the all.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the one state
of consciousness.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
It's where all beings
come together and meet.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And through reading
the Akasha, you're

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
able to see people in
their multidimensionality.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:84%
You're able to see
all they've ever been,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.270 align:middle line:90%
all that they ever will be.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And really, what I think is
unique to the Akashic Records

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.530 align:middle line:84%
is that you can see their
journey through each choice

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
that they make, so if they
make a decision, how that's

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
going to roll out and how that's
going to affect their karma.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everything we
do go in the Akashic Records?

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Every single
thing, not only us,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:90%
but any dimensional being.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
It really is a
storehouse for life.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:90%
It is the Atman.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we
can't hide anything?

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: No, everything's
being signed, sealed,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:90%
and delivered into this--

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who records it?

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.897 align:middle line:90%
What records it?

00:03:07.897 --> 00:03:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It's a good question.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:90%
I feel like we do.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:90%
I feel like it's a product of--

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're our own authors
of the Akashic Records?

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yes, it's
like the matrix.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:90%
It's all of it.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when
you get into the Akasha,

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
it allows you to go deeper
into your understanding

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:84%
of beyond the paradox, beyond
the duality of being human

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:90%
and into this state of oneness.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had this vision
of a spirit guide with a huge

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.633 align:middle line:90%
journal, long robe--

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah,
a lot of people--

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --writing,
George did this today.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: And it's perceived
that way, like that old movie,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:90%
"Defend Your Life."

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
When you go after
this incarnation,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
you go and you get to see
all the things that you

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%
could have done differently.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And I do think there's
some truth to that.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
But we come in with this code
deep within our DNA, what we've

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
come here to do,
whether it be to release

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
our karma or this
just groundhog's

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:90%
day of our own beingness.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes, people come
back to help humanity--

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: --as we evolve
through this eye of the needle.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do your
psychic readings

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:90%
a little differently than most.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I do.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me what you do.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I do.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I think psychic
readings, at large,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.080 align:middle line:84%
is a very valuable
tool that you can get

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:90%
from several different people.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And you just look at and
witness the seed, the beginning

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:90%
art of somebody's capacity.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
But when you get into the
akasha, where I tend to hover,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.880 align:middle line:84%
you see where their
blind spots are.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.450 align:middle line:84%
You see the purpose
for their incarnation.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:90%
You see their talents.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
You see past life
tremors and traumas

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
that they can't seem to
release and evolve from.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So in short, you look
at the whole chasm

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:84%
of an individual's
evolution, which I think,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:84%
as in Akashic
Records, you really

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
have to learn to hold yourself
in a certain lifestyle,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:84%
to be able to enter into
that, to begin with.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you tap into
individual's Akashic Records--

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Correct.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --like you
would tap in the mind--

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --somebody else's.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: And they're
all linked, which

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.730 align:middle line:90%
is just a mind-blowing concept.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of mode
are you in order to do this?

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: We would consider
it a mode of channeling, which

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit separate
from psychics and mediums

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.930 align:middle line:84%
because they are reading
the energy before them.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.265 align:middle line:84%
They're reading the
trajectory that is--

00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like you're
in a trance state?

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Somewhat, yes.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's like a half in,
half out kind of energy.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you show us
how you get into this mode?

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Certainly.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like a call
and response type

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.020 align:middle line:84%
of dynamic, where, through
the power of your intention,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:84%
you will yourself
through the heart,

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:84%
so with intention
to be this conduit

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.560 align:middle line:84%
to receive healing and
information for the person that

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.940 align:middle line:90%
sits with you.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And after your
intention, you seem

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.670 align:middle line:84%
to be able to pick
up on a signal.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's pretty audible.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.283 align:middle line:84%
I could hear it ringing
usually in my right ear.

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:90%
And when I respond to that--

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So like tinnitus?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.552 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It is like tinnitus.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:90%
It is exactly like tinnitus.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:90%
You just--

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY:
[NOORY MAKING BUZZING SOUND]

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: --recognize it.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:90%
That--

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:34.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: --with like,
as you could imagine,

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.470 align:middle line:84%
all of the air being sucked out
of the room at the same time.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a very bizarre energy,
and so you just lean into that.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
You trust that, and you
meld with that signal.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you become
a collective.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should the
person that you're reading

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:84%
feel violated because
you're tapping

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.003 align:middle line:90%
into their personal records?

00:06:59.003 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: That's
a good question.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.840 align:middle line:84%
We're not truly separate, so
there is not the boundaries

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:90%
that we perceive anyway.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.382 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's
public, technically.

00:07:07.382 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It's
public information.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It's through the power of
intention and alignment.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So generally, when people
find me, we are already--

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:90%
it's been written.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
It's already a part of
their walk, their journey

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.420 align:middle line:90%
for us to cross paths.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So it is just this
really seamless merger.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what I hear
most as far as feedback--

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.530 align:middle line:84%
when they leave an Akashic
Records, experience with myself

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:84%
is they don't remember a
lot of what we talked about,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.900 align:middle line:90%
because it's on beyond the mind.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And they'll leave
feeling different.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's "Beyond Belief."

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It's "Beyond Belief."

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] Yeah.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:90%
They just feel different.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:84%
They feel seen, or heard, or
I guess you could say aligned.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bonni,
give us an example

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:84%
of you tapping into
somebody's Akashic Records.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:90%
And what do you say to them?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:90%
And how do you use it?

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Sure.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:90%
So as I begin, I tune in by--

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to hear
somebody's voice first.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I love to hear their frequency,
their harmonic thumbprint.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Sound is how I--

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.445 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you chat
with them for a little--

00:08:19.445 --> 00:08:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Mm-hmm, ask them
about the weather or their dog

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and try to get that
signal from them

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
as well as I'm pairing up with a
higher planes of consciousness.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And almost immediately,
I start to feel or sense

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:39.810 align:middle line:84%
their lineage, their archetype,
their patterns, their purpose

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:40.610 align:middle line:90%
along the way--

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.938 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does
this session last?

00:08:42.938 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: About an hour.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.902 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty intense.

00:08:45.902 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Super fast,
and I talk fast and a lot,

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:90%
maybe why they don't remember.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you awake?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I'm awake,
but I'm not always

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.020 align:middle line:84%
fully aware of what
comes out of my mouth.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, things I say--

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:90%
it's news to me.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.250 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating
to hear the vantage

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:84%
point of the
collective wisdom that

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.860 align:middle line:84%
runs through me and
into the recipient.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you pull out the
good and the bad of the Akashic

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Records?

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: You could say that.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't like to speak
in any kind of binary way,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.160 align:middle line:84%
but they will show
where there is fear,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:90%
or judgment, or limited belief.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:84%
So I do tell my clients,
I'm not a doomsday psychic.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:90%
You're pretty safe with me.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And the stuff that comes
through is all about productive

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
knowledge to bring you
into harmonic alignment

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.557 align:middle line:84%
with what your soul is
trying to create and achieve

00:09:44.557 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:90%
in this particular--

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is fascinating.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever found
yourself, Bonni,

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
in a situation where you
tapped into somebody's records

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and you figure, I got
to get out of here?

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It's
a great question.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Maybe just a few times.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
a couple of times

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:84%
where I've done that, I
have sensed somebody's life

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.590 align:middle line:90%
wasn't going to be much longer.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.730 align:middle line:90%
And so that's an interesting--

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:84%
that's an interesting
crossroads.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And there has been
times where I've

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:84%
met ET resistance in
people, where they would not

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:84%
allow me to access, no
matter how hard I pushed.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
That's only happened
a couple of times,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.600 align:middle line:90%
where I was accessed denied.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, as you're
being psychic with all of this,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
have you stumbled
into other encounters

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials
or other entities?

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Very much so.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit of my wheelhouse.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:84%
I've been seeing
them or exchanging

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.760 align:middle line:84%
with their sound currents
and their knowledge

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:84%
or intentions for humanity
since as far as I can remember.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.930 align:middle line:90%
So you see that a lot in people.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:84%
You'll see people who are here
to help humanity rise right

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
now, as opposed to
perhaps people that

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:84%
have come to work
on maybe a more

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:90%
individual karmic experience.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And often, those
people are connected

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
to different races, different
planes of consciousness.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:90%
The people often feel--

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.290 align:middle line:84%
they say they're lost, or
homesick, or they don't fit in.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So you get to have a lot of
variation with contact beings,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I tell people
I'm just a cosmic linguistic--

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.950 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bonni, are
these encounters

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.360 align:middle line:84%
with higher dimensions and
entities more spiritual

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.770 align:middle line:90%
than others?

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Of course,
yes, some definitely

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:49.343 align:middle line:84%
are very focused on the repair
of Earth and Earth's resources.

00:11:49.343 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They care about us.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Very
much, very much so.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then others?

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Others
seem to be here doing

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:84%
some type of research or
advancing their own status.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very different,
just like people.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Some people are out for
their own well-being,

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.980 align:middle line:84%
and some feel driven
to help the collective.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a light being?

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: A light being to me
would be the way that they come

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.420 align:middle line:84%
across and their
vibration, the way

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.528 align:middle line:84%
that they cycle
light and time, how

00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:90%
they operate in time and space.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.438 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they angelic?

00:12:28.438 --> 00:12:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Some people
call light beings angelic.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I think
William Henry does.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.997 align:middle line:84%
They seem to vibrate at a
very high, high resonance,

00:12:35.997 --> 00:12:37.080 align:middle line:90%
with the different sound--

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some
pictures to show you.

00:12:38.955 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:90%
You tell us what they are at.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:84%
The first is what
we call "the dome."

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLES]

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Explain that, Bonni.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.360 align:middle line:10%
>>MCCLISS: The dome
built itself in a way.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:54.570 align:middle line:10%
It spoke to us step by step on
what needed to come together,

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.670 align:middle line:10%
and it definitely started
with the land, started

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:10%
with the fantastic elements
of the crystal grids

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:10%
in Hot Springs, Arkansas.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a geodesic dome
created by Buckminster Fuller--

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yes, correct,
Buckminster Fuller, yes.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.110 align:middle line:10%
And there's quite a bit
of science backing it,

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.350 align:middle line:10%
but we weren't led
by the science.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:10%
We were led by intuition, which
brought to us step-by-step

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.800 align:middle line:10%
what needed to happen
to inhabit this.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this built
in a certain area?

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.497 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It's built
directly on crystal grid,

00:13:29.497 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:90%
natural forms of crystal--

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh really?

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: --grid.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that give
it any special powers?

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It does.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
It seems to create and
generate positive ions.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.042 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
go inside the dome now

00:13:40.042 --> 00:13:41.550 align:middle line:90%
and see what it looks like.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.380 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of cool.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It is.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that somebody
lying down on the floor?

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Mm-hmm.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so generally, people
will come and lie down,

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and we'll use sound and
different frequencies,

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.130 align:middle line:84%
different instruments to bring
them into altered states.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: And the
geodesic aspect of the dome

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.303 align:middle line:84%
seems to help this kind of
harmonic resonance complete.

00:14:04.303 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because of
the way it's shaped?

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Mm-hmm.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:12.255 align:middle line:84%
Has quite an interesting
acoustic aspect to it as well.

00:14:12.255 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what else is there.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: OK.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, what is this?

00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: So this is
another-- just another aspect

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.750 align:middle line:84%
of the dome when
we're sitting there

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:90%
with the different sounds.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And again, the way that we use
sound and the crystal balls

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.360 align:middle line:90%
is very intuitive.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.170 align:middle line:84%
We use different lights,
different colors,

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and different
instruments again just

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.803 align:middle line:84%
to try to bring forward
whatever energy--

00:14:35.803 --> 00:14:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about chanting?

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: --is present.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.350 align:middle line:90%
We do chanting, yoga.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OM?

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes, we do OM.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:10%
We do a lot of the Hebrew
akemic statements, like ehyeh

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.120 align:middle line:10%
or Jehovah Elohim.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:84%
We reach back to some of
the ancient properties

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and teachings from
the mystery schools,

00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we named it
The Legend of Greater Things.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had an ET
contact yourself, didn't you,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:90%
during one of these sound baths?

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:90%
So it was interesting.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.050 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't necessarily
like anything

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.250 align:middle line:90%
we've ever seen before.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Although, a lot of people talk
about different encounters

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
or beings that they'll come
across while at the dome

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:23.620 align:middle line:84%
because we are really engaging
in this climactic womb

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:90%
of resonance.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And these sine waves seem to
be doing something very, very

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.590 align:middle line:90%
different and peculiar.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But one night specifically,
I think it was in April 2021,

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.390 align:middle line:84%
we had invited an
astrologer to give a speak--

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:84%
or, to give a
speaking engagement.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And he came out, and he was
on the outside of the dome.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I
recognized was strange

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
was that my electronic
equipment to film him

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and what he was doing
started to really mess up.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.142 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go haywire.

00:15:52.142 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: What's that?

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go a little haywire.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah, the
electronics went haywire,

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and I thought that
was really strange.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's not untypical
for the dome,

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.500 align:middle line:84%
because we're out in
the middle of a field.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:90%
And Wi-Fi is crazy.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:84%
But as the night drove on, I
noticed other strange aspects.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:84%
There seemed to be an odd energy
with the people that have come.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:84%
People were very, very
still and almost sleepy.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.255 align:middle line:84%
There was a fog
somewhat descending--

00:16:22.255 --> 00:16:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a mist?

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: --around like a mist.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:84%
In prior ET contact, I know that
that's an element that comes.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That waves
in first somehow.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes, it does.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a lot of times,
it cloaks the UFO, for example.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Correct.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:84%
It absolutely does, and it has a
different sound resonance to it

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So that started to seem
kind of strange to me.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And then if that wasn't
enough, to top it all off,

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:49.953 align:middle line:84%
there was an owl that
had come and landed

00:16:49.953 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:84%
on the banister on the
other side of the dome.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's always
an interesting sign.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Always an interesting

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.010 align:middle line:90%
--sign.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So I just knew it
was strange, and I

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
knew something was
different than normal.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:84%
But I truly didn't think
too much more about it.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:84%
So when my astrologer
concluded his talk,

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:11.369 align:middle line:84%
everybody ran inside for the
second phase of this event,

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:13.650 align:middle line:84%
where we were going to
use sound and instrument

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and meditation sure to bring
them into an altered state.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was a little
bit strange to, George,

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle line:84%
because normally people will
come up, and they will talk.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And I have a hard time herding
them into the dome to prepare

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:84%
for this next [NON-ENGLISH],,
next part of whatever

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:90%
we're going to do.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:84%
But that night,
there was no talking.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:84%
They all just seem to
just run into the dome,

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.110 align:middle line:84%
lay down, curl up
in their blankets,

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.633 align:middle line:84%
like little inch
worms, and just--

00:17:43.633 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:84%
they just got really
still very quickly.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were vegetated.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.112 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It was
strange, which I've never

00:17:48.112 --> 00:17:49.380 align:middle line:90%
seen that's behavior.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, tell us
about these hooded beings.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: That's
where it went to.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So right before we were going
into our meditation, actually,

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
two people jumped up
and left immediately.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
One lady got in her car drove
all the way back to Nashville,

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and my astrologer-- he
just took off and left

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:90%
too, so odd components.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So we started in, and I'm the
one leading the meditation.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm a regressionalist
by trade, and I

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:22.440 align:middle line:84%
was going to use a certain
meditation to bring them in.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was very strange,
because my mind went blank

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:90%
at that moment.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:90%
Like you were losing control?

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Like I
was losing my focus.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't remember how to
set people up for hypnosis.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.240 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was odd.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Strange.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I started to get
a little nervous.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And something else came
into my mind entirely,

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and I asked people to just begun
to relax and release their body

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and vibrate into the light
being that they truly are.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was an
odd command or ask.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:90%
I've never said that to anyone.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you had not
seen the hooded beings

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.180 align:middle line:90%
at this point?

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Correct.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:90%
They were not there.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.970 align:middle line:84%
But again, it was just
an odd experience.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So after the
meditation, I just told

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:84%
them to continue to breathe
and to relax their bodies.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down to
play my instruments,

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and we use sound
balls, crystal balls.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that
happened was it wouldn't play.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another
haywire experience.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Another-- yes,
the vibration wouldn't-- it

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't resonate.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.972 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
something was interfering.

00:19:28.972 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the
two people that I was

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.888 align:middle line:90%
playing the instruments with.

00:19:31.888 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:84%
They also had these
singing balls,

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.567 align:middle line:84%
and they were experiencing
the same thing.

00:19:36.567 --> 00:19:38.150 align:middle line:84%
We were giving hand
gestures, like, we

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.740 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's going on.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:90%
We're confused.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So continue to struggle
with these balls.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And I even stepped
over to the gong

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:84%
to start to get the gong
vibration to go into

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and to create a
resonance, and it

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:84%
sounded like you were
kicking a tin can.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:90%
It was a really strange thing.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I turned around
to go back to the balls

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
is when I started to
see a gray mist forming

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:84%
towards the right
hemisphere of the dome.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I saw several--

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it was anywhere
between 12 or 15 hooded beings

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.150 align:middle line:90%
entering the site--

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.647 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they look human?

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Absolutely not.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:84%
No, I've seen these
energies once before,

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard to
see their faces.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, your partner
Kayce Johnson was there too

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:90%
as a witness--

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: She was.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.142 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --during this event.

00:20:30.142 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:10%
>>KAYCE JOHNSON: We've done a
ton of soundbars at the dome.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:10%
And we do them together, me
and my mother, Karla Shepard,

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.160 align:middle line:10%
and Bonni.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And this one started off
just like they always do,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:84%
where you have quite a
few people that come.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.130 align:middle line:90%
The dome's getting full.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's coming in.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:90%
People start to lay down.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And so what we usually do
is we'll have a meditation,

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.467 align:middle line:90%
and we'll do some breathwork.

00:20:54.467 --> 00:20:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And we just really try
to get people relaxed

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.710 align:middle line:90%
before we start playing.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But this time, when we start
playing, it just-- the sound

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:90%
was so off.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.790 align:middle line:90%
The balls weren't playing right.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:90%
They weren't sounding right.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:84%
When we got to play the
gong, the gong would even--

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.230 align:middle line:84%
normally just echoes
across the dome,

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and it's really
loud and beautiful.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And that night, it was making
just this tin, deadpan sound.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Every time we'd hear it, it was
like the vibration of the room

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:90%
was being altered.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.577 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt like we had
been playing for forever.

00:21:28.577 --> 00:21:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
looking up at the clock,

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and it was like
time it stood still.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:37.010 align:middle line:84%
It just kept going on and on and
like the clock wasn't moving.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And then this lady stands up
in the middle of the room,

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.595 align:middle line:84%
and she starts making
these hand movements.

00:21:42.595 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:84%
She sits up, and
she starts doing

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:84%
all these different
mudras and gestures

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:84%
with her arm and her
hands, not saying anything,

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
just almost like she
was directing something.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:90%
It was really wild.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And then we slowly
pull everyone up.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're just talking
to people afterwards

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and getting their
reactions to everything,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:84%
just seeing how
it felt for them.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:10%
And at least 10
people who were there

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:11.180 align:middle line:10%
talked about experiencing
that it felt like they

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:10%
were being pulled
out of their bodies.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.795 align:middle line:10%
It felt like something
was coming to get them

00:22:14.795 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:10%
and pulling them
up, like they all

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:10%
had the same kind of
description happening.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:84%
It was just a really
wild and tense night,

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't had it
happen like that since.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Normally, when we go down to
play the balls, it's fine.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And we had changed
nothing that night,

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:90%
so it was just a really weird--

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.700 align:middle line:84%
it was like something
came in and had altered

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.030 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the room,
that vibrational experience,

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:90%
that space.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
quite a night, Bonni.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It was.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.460 align:middle line:84%
It was one for the
books, for sure.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
strange things.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.922 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
caused all these distortions

00:22:46.922 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:84%
with the electronics
and things like that?

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I believe it was
a bit of a perfect storm.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there was
many different components.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:10%
Often, I hear that dates matter,
that these harmonic convergence

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:10%
will happen during certain
phases of the moon,

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.015 align:middle line:10%
or planetary
alignments, or dates.

00:23:05.015 --> 00:23:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So it could have been
just this perfect thing

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:90%
that we happened upon.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The right people,
all of it together

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.120 align:middle line:84%
created this really
interesting, I think,

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:84%
blip and the resonance, and
things came to check it out.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:84%
They felt very much to me
like an inner Earth species.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.022 align:middle line:84%
There may have been other
type of energies around but--

00:23:28.022 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But within the
hollow Earth, if we have one?

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Yes, which is
pretty in alignment

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:84%
with the beliefs
for that land as it

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:84%
pertains to the owners
that have come before us.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you've been back
to the dome several times,

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:90%
haven't you?

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.228 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Here's a picture
of a different night.

00:23:46.228 --> 00:23:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about
this kind of activity.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:90%
That's definitely a distortion.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I feel like, when we start
bringing in the sound--

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is a
really intuitive engagement

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.860 align:middle line:90%
on our part.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:84%
We just set ourselves
up as, again--

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that you?

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: --these channels.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And through intention,
I can speak for myself,

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:90%
we're moving into--

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving into
just altered states

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and using the sound to
really elicit this healing.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.380 align:middle line:84%
So when I looked
at this picture,

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:84%
my first feeling was
that distortion right

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:84%
there in the middle felt
like an actual being.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Or I could sense that there's
something else going on

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.288 align:middle line:84%
So that's a bit
par for the course.

00:24:28.288 --> 00:24:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there much
paranormal activity

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:90%
out there, Bonni?

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Quite
a bit, actually,

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:84%
which-- people will come and
give us different accounts.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Some people hear
singing on the land.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.268 align:middle line:84%
People are scared to
stay there at night.

00:24:42.268 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scared-- really?

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Were you?

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Well, no.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, [CHUCKLES] I'm
fascinated by this stuff.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.420 align:middle line:90%
But you can just sense it.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:84%
When you walk on the
land, you can just sense.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Very sensitive people-- they
know something's happening,

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and you usually are affected
one way or the other.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.190 align:middle line:84%
You either lean in,
and you want to be

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:84%
a part of something
great and unknown,

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:90%
or it drives you the other way.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And you just-- you shut down,
and you don't come back.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So the dome and the
land itself certainly

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:20.250 align:middle line:84%
has its own way of dividing and
calling in people that need it.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So honestly, every
experience that we have there

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:24.807 align:middle line:90%
is its own unique.

00:25:24.807 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.220 align:middle line:84%
You've got another partner
named Karla Shepard,

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and she talks about the UFO
sightings around this property.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.070 align:middle line:10%
>>KARLA SHEPARD: The land
has been in our family

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.310 align:middle line:10%
for generations.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:40.660 align:middle line:10%
And several years ago,
my father was talking

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.460 align:middle line:10%
to a great aunt of mine.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:90%
And she had lived on the old--

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:84%
what we call the Old
Homestead, and it

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.540 align:middle line:84%
overlooks-- there
is a wooded area,

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
the Old Homestead.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
dome beyond the woods.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And she told my father that she
was doing dishes one evening--

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and this had been-- this
was many, many years ago--

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.720 align:middle line:90%
and that she saw a UFO.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And she saw it land right in the
vicinity of where the dome was,

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and she said she had
never told anyone,

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:84%
because she didn't think that
anyone would believe her.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.870 align:middle line:10%
But she knew that my dad
would in her older years.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:10%
And so Bonni and Kayce and I had
talked to my father about this.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And my father-- by trade, he
worked in the X-ray business.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And he had a side
business at one point,

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:37.690 align:middle line:84%
where they would extract
the silver from the X-rays.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And they would make
them into silver bars.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And so for a long time, he
had some of those silver bars.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:10%
And he said, just very
casually one day-- he

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:10%
said, yeah-- he said, I'll never
forget, when an ET visited me

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.300 align:middle line:10%
and needed help
with his spacecraft.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.390 align:middle line:84%
He said that there was something
wrong with it, and he said,

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.150 align:middle line:84%
he needed some
silver to repair it.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he'd
only got one bar.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.320 align:middle line:84%
He didn't need much, he
said, but I was glad to help.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.630 align:middle line:10%
So we do have a little bit
of history with UFOs and ETs

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:18.185 align:middle line:10%
that have visited us long
before the dome was there.

00:27:18.185 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:24.020 align:middle line:84%
What else kind ET activity,
Bonni, was out that way?

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: A lot of it was
just stories from the family,

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:31.060 align:middle line:84%
or even generations
beyond generations.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's actually kind of--

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hand-me-down stories?

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It was just
hand-me-down stories, correct.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And even for that
part of Hot Springs,

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
there's been mass
sightings that news

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:90%
has covered over the decades.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:49.330 align:middle line:84%
But as far as Karla's
father, he did.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
He would just tell
you straightforward,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I've watched craft land
here on this property.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.350 align:middle line:90%
They have a purpose.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:00.640 align:middle line:84%
He would speak at great detail
about the inner Earth beings.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.060 align:middle line:84%
He believed he could
locate the actual entryway

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.260 align:middle line:90%
into the caverns.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And I know I would have
dreams in accordance

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:90%
to what he was saying.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.980 align:middle line:84%
He even went so
far before he died

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.550 align:middle line:84%
as to have this big boulder
moved so that people

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.397 align:middle line:84%
could find a way to go into
these inner Earth caverns and--

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like Jesus
moving the boulder.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah,
he was set on it.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.168 align:middle line:90%
He knew it, yeah.

00:28:25.168 --> 00:28:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
times, when there's

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:84%
a lot of ET activity,
the men in black show up.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Did that happen here too?

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It did.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.940 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to
that night where

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:38.650 align:middle line:84%
we had that collective of
experience, and it was-- again,

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.970 align:middle line:84%
people left with their own
thoughts about the occurrence.

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.247 align:middle line:84%
Many people saw
the same visions.

00:28:45.247 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was only a
few years ago, right?

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah, April
2021, really recent.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Some people thought
they had died.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:84%
There was a man
in particular who

00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:00.400 align:middle line:84%
was ex-military who came to me
after the whole thing happened,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.640 align:middle line:84%
just sobbing, thought he
thought he had died because he

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.320 align:middle line:90%
had seen the higher realms.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.965 align:middle line:84%
It was a really
interesting situation.

00:29:06.965 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, something happened
also before that, right,

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.180 align:middle line:90%
in March of 2020?

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Mm-hmm.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was that?

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: So if we go
back to March 4, 2020,

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that actually happened on
my property, where I live.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
really peculiar night

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.480 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of different reasons.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But the eve of that night, I
had this very strong instinct

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.550 align:middle line:84%
to really go into deep
stages of meditation

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and to prepare for something,
which is not my norm,

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.090 align:middle line:90%
to meditate at night.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I did that, and I
went to sleep, like I do.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of the
night, I guess around 2:00

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:51.940 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, there was
a really strange primal cry

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.930 align:middle line:90%
and sound.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you could
combine just this--

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:84%
a crash sound with almost,
like, this tribal scream

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:84%
that shot straight up in
the middle of the night--

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:90%
was really strange.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was it?

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah, I was
trying to figure that out.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
I thought maybe

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I woke myself up with
some really interesting

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:14.980 align:middle line:84%
primal scream, so was sitting
there a little disoriented,

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.377 align:middle line:90%
trying to understand.

00:30:16.377 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And just as soon as I was
sitting there and trying

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to reflect on what could have
made such an ungodly sound,

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:27.430 align:middle line:84%
magenta sparks began to move
into and throughout my bedroom.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like an energy wave?

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Like an energy wave.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And typically, you can
see those things astrally

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:90%
in your mind's eye.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.820 align:middle line:84%
But this was different
because it was just as clear

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:42.830 align:middle line:84%
with my physical eyes shooting
through my bedroom, so

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.175 align:middle line:84%
definitely could sense
something was going on.

00:30:45.175 --> 00:30:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And I got up that evening,
and I went to my bathroom,

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:52.920 align:middle line:84%
just because-- just trying to
find some bit of orientation.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was washing my hands and
looking out my second floor

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.630 align:middle line:84%
window, out into the
property, where I noticed

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.030 align:middle line:90%
a very strange illuminated--

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.160 align:middle line:84%
this illumination
above the trees.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.900 align:middle line:84%
At first, I thought
it was just the moon

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:90%
and the reflection of the moon.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.100 align:middle line:84%
But as I kept staring
at it, it definitely

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.600 align:middle line:84%
looked like some
interdimensional craft,

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.988 align:middle line:84%
nothing solid, like the
ships or the metal blips.

00:31:19.988 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a hologram?

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Like a
hologram, exactly.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.120 align:middle line:84%
It definitely looked
like a hologram.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:24.920 align:middle line:90%
It had a very--

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.640 align:middle line:84%
in particular or specific--
had a very specific Y shape

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the craft.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So I sat there for a few
moments just looking at it.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever seen an
ET, then you look at it,

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:90%
and you're in awe.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the strange "go
back about your business"

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:46.287 align:middle line:84%
feeling comes over you,
like, OK, I saw it.

00:31:46.287 --> 00:31:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like no big deal.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Moving
on, no big deal.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a very bizarre--

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd freak out.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.413 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: --energy.

00:31:51.413 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can have a freak out.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.780 align:middle line:90%
You can have an awe.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you just have this
"let it all go" feeling.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So I left the bathroom
and went back to bed,

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and again, a lot of
energy in the room

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:84%
to the point of
nausea and vertigo.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And all at once, an energy
began to form in my room.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.390 align:middle line:84%
I say "she" because it had
a very female nature to her.

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:19.980 align:middle line:84%
She was very, very tall,
very slender, very white,

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.818 align:middle line:84%
almost like a
bioluminescence feel.

00:32:21.818 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't
feel threatened at all?

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Not at
all, not at all.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I've had a background with
many different interdimensional

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.640 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:84%
This one was very solid
and striking, though.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Human looking?

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Human
looking somewhat,

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.860 align:middle line:90%
but she had the larger eyes.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And the eyes really
stuck out to me

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.430 align:middle line:84%
because it was
like you would see

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.380 align:middle line:90%
clouds moving at a hyperspeed.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:90%
It was some kind of anomaly.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A dream.

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah, like a dream.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Something was moving through
her eyesight, just a rapid pace.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So I made my way back to
my bed through all of this,

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.530 align:middle line:84%
just sitting there trying
to take it in and find

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:03.013 align:middle line:90%
some kind of alignment.

00:33:03.013 --> 00:33:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And the next strange
thing that happened

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.770 align:middle line:84%
is my husband, who was beside
me through all of this--

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:11.260 align:middle line:84%
he shot up and ran,
and he stood outside.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: He's done that
a couple of times during--

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.285 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he awake?

00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: No, he's in--

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:17.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like sleepwalking?

00:33:17.415 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: He's,
like, sleepwalking.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And this has happened before,
where he'll just go outside.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And he stays out there
with what feels like just

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:90%
an exuberant amount of time.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he looking
into the skies?

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: He's almost like
he's in an altered state.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's
not aware of this.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.215 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: He's not-- it's
a bit like sleepwalking.

00:33:36.215 --> 00:33:37.060 align:middle line:90%
He's unaware.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: So this being
went on to say-- at the time,

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I thought it kept repeating
the word "Ishani--" "Ishani."

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But as I've played
this over in my mind,

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I now believe that it was trying
to say the word "Sisani--"

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:52.352 align:middle line:90%
"Sisani."

00:33:52.352 --> 00:33:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.852 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It's a type of race.

00:33:54.852 --> 00:33:56.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a type of being.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a type of--

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:02.490 align:middle line:84%
it's an agenda, actually, as
far as what I can understand.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So went on to give me
some messages for myself

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and then for the
rest of humanity.

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:09.449 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they tap
into the Akashic Records?

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:12.342 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I believe
they do, 100%, they do.

00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
know all about us?

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Mm-hmm.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Are you glad you have this gift?

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I am glad.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't always been that--
it hasn't always been that way.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:27.820 align:middle line:84%
It's been a long journey of
confusion and disorientation

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.810 align:middle line:90%
and feeling alone.

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has it ever
backfired on you?

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I think it has in
the past when nobody understood

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:middle line:90%
what was happening.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.210 align:middle line:90%
It would backfire.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.159 align:middle line:84%
People thought a
long time ago that I

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.409 align:middle line:84%
might have just
been losing my mind,

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:45.846 align:middle line:90%
but it's made me who I am.

00:34:45.846 --> 00:34:47.429 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people do you think,

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Bonni, have this ability, and
they just don't realize it?

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I believe everybody
has a psychic ability.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:56.500 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a part of
our human birthright.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's how
we're going to move

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.048 align:middle line:84%
through this next phase of
humanity, of our own evolution.

00:35:05.048 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:90%
It's how we're going to--

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This shift we're
going to go through.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: --make it
through the shift.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So right now, it is that
time that everybody's

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.560 align:middle line:84%
spoken about, the
Great Awakening,

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.520 align:middle line:84%
this capacity through the human
center, human biology, to--

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.535 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When will
this awakening occur?

00:35:23.535 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I think we're
in the middle of it.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:90%
I think we're starting.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.240 align:middle line:90%
I think it's now.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Especially when you look at
all of the different prophecies

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and Indigenous
beliefs as far as this

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.270 align:middle line:84%
goes into the Egyptian
archives or into the Maya,

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:38.640 align:middle line:84%
they all collectively
believe that this

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.800 align:middle line:84%
is the time of the
Great Awakening.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
picked for some reason?

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I believe I was
contacted as a young child

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:49.770 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:50.728 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Two years old.

00:35:50.728 --> 00:35:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah, two years old--

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:56.810 align:middle line:84%
to go into training,
to become someone

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:00.290 align:middle line:84%
who can help lead many
others just like me,

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and to really help us
understand this resonance

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:06.320 align:middle line:84%
shift that the Earth
is going through,

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.440 align:middle line:84%
that our human biologies
are going through.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.087 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they've
been training me

00:36:12.087 --> 00:36:14.420 align:middle line:84%
since I was a child to help
understand these different--

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're getting
you ready for something.

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: --resonances.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, do you
know what that is?

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Think so.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.150 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:26.110 align:middle line:84%
On that night of March 4,
when I had that encounter

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:84%
with that being, she gave
me this whole deliverance

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:84%
of things that we're
about to come to Earth.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.680 align:middle line:90%
And she--

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good things
and bad things?

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:36.540 align:middle line:90%
She--

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And have any of them
happened in the last two years?

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:40.165 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: They have.

00:36:40.165 --> 00:36:41.210 align:middle line:90%
They have.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.000 align:middle line:84%
If we look at that
date, March 4, 2020,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.080 align:middle line:84%
that was about 10 or
11 days before America

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.860 align:middle line:84%
really knew what
it was up against,

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:55.340 align:middle line:84%
before they understood that
the coronavirus was going

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.637 align:middle line:90%
to be their journey as well.

00:36:56.637 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And wars
and everything else.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: And wars, all of it.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So this being said
that there was

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.990 align:middle line:84%
going to be a push of
terror on our planet.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I thought,
what a terrible thing to say.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:90%
And you think about terrorism--

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --right?

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.757 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: No way--
you could take

00:37:14.757 --> 00:37:17.820 align:middle line:84%
that in so many different
ways that I wasn't

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:22.260 align:middle line:84%
clear on the purpose or how
deep it went when she gave me

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.850 align:middle line:90%
that information.

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:27.390 align:middle line:84%
She said that this is
something that they

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.950 align:middle line:90%
called the Great Return.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:33.000 align:middle line:84%
The great solar return was
happening to humanity and that,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.210 align:middle line:84%
based on where we're going in
these new resonances, where

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.280 align:middle line:84%
we're going in this
new energetic cavity

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that Earth is
evolving into, we had

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:45.240 align:middle line:84%
to drop our lower
vibrational stories.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So anything that we
held in the shadows,

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.940 align:middle line:90%
our pain, our traumas--

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.930 align:middle line:90%
they had to come home.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:53.790 align:middle line:90%
We had to face it.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.620 align:middle line:90%
We had to integrate it.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.660 align:middle line:84%
We had to call back
the pieces of ourselves

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.983 align:middle line:84%
that we just didn't have
the courage to look at.

00:38:00.983 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bonni, let's go
back to your husband again.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Sure.

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
come up with any rationale

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.530 align:middle line:84%
on why he just went outside
in this daze, staring

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.253 align:middle line:90%
into the heavens?

00:38:12.253 --> 00:38:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I believe--

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe that when he gets--
when my husband comes into--

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:18.313 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they summon him?

00:38:18.313 --> 00:38:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: No, I don't
believe that's what happened.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I think this has
happened before when

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:26.810 align:middle line:84%
he is in certain
fields of energy

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.330 align:middle line:84%
or when certain
things are occurring

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:90%
with interdimensional beings.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.640 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as it's a part
of his journey to step back.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is a very
benevolent engagement.

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:84%
This is stuff that
maybe I have a contract

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.950 align:middle line:84%
to understand perhaps,
but he knows his place.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think, with some people,
if certain qualities of contact

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.540 align:middle line:84%
come through, they
can't mentally house it.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Or their body just can't
hold what's going on,

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.580 align:middle line:84%
so often they just
won't wake up.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.140 align:middle line:90%
They won't remember.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.660 align:middle line:84%
As for him, he's a
bit of a protector.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And so it's in his deepest
instincts to go check it out.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there's
some kind of variation--

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, he wasn't awake.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.550 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't conscious.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:13.908 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: No, he was in
some altered state, yeah.

00:39:13.908 --> 00:39:15.658 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
think they picked you?

00:39:15.658 --> 00:39:19.890 align:middle line:90%


00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I don't know.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not just about me.

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:25.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are many
people that have this capacity

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.457 align:middle line:90%
to work interdimensionally.

00:39:27.457 --> 00:39:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's
many like you out there?

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Oh, very much, yes.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I think certain
souls, certain people

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:38.220 align:middle line:84%
have come back at this
time to help humanity rise.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.380 align:middle line:84%
This is a really,
really important time,

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:45.130 align:middle line:84%
very similar to Gregg Braden's
work in "The Isaiah Effect."

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great guy.

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:47.305 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: We
could really have--

00:39:47.305 --> 00:39:49.470 align:middle line:84%
very, very intelligent
researcher.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.860 align:middle line:84%
We really could end up on
two different variations

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.700 align:middle line:90%
of timelines.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have a lot of
these messages come through

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.320 align:middle line:84%
for humanity, they
really are trying

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.870 align:middle line:84%
to help us stabilize in our mind
without losing or shattering

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.070 align:middle line:90%
on the mental plane.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.190 align:middle line:84%
They're helping
our biologies grow

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and to encounter
some of these charged

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:84%
particles that are entering
into Earth's atmosphere

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:13.700 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This cosmic shift
that's going to occur--

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.400 align:middle line:90%
will it be dramatic?

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, will we all know
that something's going on?

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Yes, I mean, we're
right in the middle of it.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.730 align:middle line:90%
We're right in the middle of it.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:30.780 align:middle line:10%
Referring back to that being,
a part of what she said

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.800 align:middle line:10%
was coming onto humanity, even
just a couple of years ago--

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.330 align:middle line:10%
she said that there
will be charged

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:39.330 align:middle line:10%
particles, cosmic radiation.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:41.760 align:middle line:10%
I'd never heard of this, but
she said the words "gamma

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.565 align:middle line:10%
radiation" entering
into Earth's atmosphere.

00:40:44.565 --> 00:40:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds like an attack.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah, it does.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.630 align:middle line:84%
It does, but our whole
solar system's evolving.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.030 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
Mayan understood.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:59.880 align:middle line:84%
This is why we're considered
to be at a galactic center.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you're hopeful.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Very
much hopeful, yeah.

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:06.860 align:middle line:84%
There are ways to align with the
frequencies that are befalling

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.930 align:middle line:90%
on Earth at this time.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:12.170 align:middle line:84%
We just need to learn
to listen and to be more

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:17.317 align:middle line:84%
still and into
resonance or in tune

00:41:17.317 --> 00:41:19.400 align:middle line:84%
with what's going on with
us individually and then

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.240 align:middle line:90%
collectively.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.988 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bonni, how do
people get a hold of you?

00:41:22.988 --> 00:41:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: People can find
me through my website.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.420 align:middle line:90%
They can find--

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is?

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.980 align:middle line:10%
>>MCCLISS: www.psychicbonni.com

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Psychicbonni.com.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:31.870 align:middle line:10%
>>MCCLISS: Mm-hmm.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: B-O-N-N-I-E?

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.800 align:middle line:10%
>>MCCLISS: B-O-N-N-I.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:38.690 align:middle line:84%
It's important for
people to know that.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:39.665 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah.

00:41:39.665 --> 00:41:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.562 align:middle line:84%
Since you've been doing
this, what's next for you?

00:41:43.562 --> 00:41:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I'm going
to continue to write

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:48.750 align:middle line:84%
about the messages that are
coming through for humanity.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:49.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to teach.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to speak
about these things.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Higher beings are definitely
wanting to deliver the "how."

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through you?

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Through me
and through many others.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
like an ambassador?

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It's exactly.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just a messenger
and an ambassador

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.180 align:middle line:84%
for this shift of the
ages to help people

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:10.540 align:middle line:84%
understand how to hold
themselves accountable,

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.640 align:middle line:84%
how to release stuff
that binds them,

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and step into their purpose
because they're here--

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
get ready for this?

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: You can.

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How?

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: You can.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I think, from my
understanding, some

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:24.660 align:middle line:84%
of the best ways that
you could ready yourself

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:28.530 align:middle line:84%
for this transition is to move
into something that they regard

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:34.980 align:middle line:84%
as the unmanifest, to
stop creating just all

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:40.620 align:middle line:84%
of this resonance, or to stop
creating chaos unto ourselves,

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.680 align:middle line:84%
to get very, very, very
still and to slow down.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So the slower that you become,
the higher your vibration

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:49.990 align:middle line:90%
will rise.

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And they also say that we are
making way too many actions

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.850 align:middle line:90%
as human beings.

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So the less we do in
some bizarre reality,

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:04.480 align:middle line:84%
the more we can accomplish,
and to trust your life.

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're not
scared of any of this?

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I'm not
scared anymore, no.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:08.980 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I was a long--

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:14.192 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot to take in when
you see these messengers enter

00:43:14.192 --> 00:43:15.400 align:middle line:90%
into the middle of the night.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.233 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --when you're
two years old, right?

00:43:17.233 --> 00:43:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah.

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bonni, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Thank you for
bringing this story out.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:24.080 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I don't know exactly
what entails my Akashic

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:30.190 align:middle line:10%
Records, but I do know that
the future of my records

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.440 align:middle line:10%
hopefully will be upbeat.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
