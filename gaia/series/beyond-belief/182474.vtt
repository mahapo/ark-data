>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:10%
We are going around the
globe with Brad Olsen, author

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:10%
of nine books, including two
in his "Esoteric" series--

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:10%
"Modern Esoteric" and
"Future Esoteric."

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And Brad is just returned
studying megaliths

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle line:90%
in South America.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And you are here to tell us
about this, Mister Indiana

How are you?

Welcome back.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.818 align:middle line:90%
>>BRAD OLSEN: Thanks, George.

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Glad to be back, and
what an adventure it was.

>>NOORY: Tell me
about the logistics,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:84%
getting to South
America and looking

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.953 align:middle line:90%
at some of these structures.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Well, I did
things a little bit

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.780 align:middle line:10%
differently, because I was going
down there for four months.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:10%
So I bought a vehicle in South
America in Santiago, Chile,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:10%
and drove all the way up from
Santiago, Chile to Cusco, Peru,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:10%
and then met up with Nassim
Haramein and Brien Foerster

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:10%
in the Resonance Academy
tour of sacred places in Peru

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.915 align:middle line:10%
and Bolivia.

00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:84%
There was a point where we were
going over a mountain pass that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:90%
was 16,600 feet high.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So it had to be a sturdy
vehicle, and it was.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.267 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had a road
to get up that high?

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:26.067 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: There was.

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Up on the Altiplano,
the elevations

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
are unbelievably
elevated because it

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:90%
is such a high plateau.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Lake Titicaca itself
is at 12,500 feet.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you need
any governmental approval

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.132 align:middle line:84%
when you went to look
at some of these sites?

00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The sites are
basically tourist sites,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
as if we are going to a national
park here in this country.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:84%
You have to pay an
admission for most of them.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
But there is no real
governmental approval,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.868 align:middle line:84%
so much as just paying
to access the sites.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about the megaliths.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.980 align:middle line:90%
What were you looking for?

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, what's so
fascinating about the region

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:84%
in Peru around the
sacred valley is,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:84%
it's the highest concentration
of megaliths in the world.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's only a matter
of a couple miles--

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes along
the Inca Trail--

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle line:84%
to go from site
to site, and we're

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.705 align:middle line:84%
talking about blocks that
could be as large as 70 tons.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do they
move these things?

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.385 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's
the big question.

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
the pyramid secret.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.823 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:02:27.823 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
parallels with ancient Egypt

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
with pre-Incan Peru as how
these building techniques were

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:84%
employed and how the blocks
were brought to the site.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you were
looking at the blocks,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Brad, was there any
thoughts in your head about,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.935 align:middle line:84%
how do they really do this,
when you look at them?

00:02:50.935 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's
the first thought

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
that goes through your
mind, because the precision

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:84%
of the fit is so incredible
that you can't even

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.177 align:middle line:84%
put a piece of paper or a credit
card or anything in there.

00:03:02.177 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a razor blade.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Or even a razor blade.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And these lines are just not
your straight 90 degree lines.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.088 align:middle line:84%
They go at curvatures
and different angles.

00:03:11.088 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it's like a puzzle?

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Correct.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Which is earthquake-proof,
and that's why the oldest

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:90%
megaliths-- similar to Egypt--

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.240 align:middle line:90%
are the best preserved.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned
Brien Foerster.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Great researcher.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And you went through
the Peru area with him?

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Correct.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And he is on the cutting
edge of redefining

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
many of these monuments,
looking at what

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:84%
established historians would
say were created by the Incan.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.090 align:middle line:84%
He is saying, they're all
pre-Incan, the large megaliths.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence is, you can
see the Inca construction

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:90%
on top of the old megaliths.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After the fact.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: After the fact.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.485 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's Look at
the little video on Brien.

00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:53.285 align:middle line:90%

- The site of SacsayhuamÃ¡n,
or [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:10%
This is the largest polygonal
wall in the Americas.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:10%
The Quarry is eight kilometers,
or five miles, away.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:10%
The question is, how
were these stones

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:10%
moved from the
quarry which is up

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:10%
and over a series of mountains?

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:10%
Conventional archeology
says that, because there

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:10%
was a high population
in Cusco, people

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:33.175 align:middle line:10%
would be able to simply roll the
stones on top of wooden rollers

00:04:33.175 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:10%
that sort of distance, and
pulling with ropes, et cetera,

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:10%
et cetera.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:10%
But they can't explain
how something of this size

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:10%
was cut from the
bedrock wall, A. And B,

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:10%
the fact is that, in Inca
times, the only trees that

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.530 align:middle line:10%
grew in this area are
small scrub trees that

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.120 align:middle line:10%
do not have straight--

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:10%
not stems, but trunks.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:10%
And so the alternative
explanation

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:10%
is that this was built thousands
of years before the Inca,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:10%
and was done by a race that
understood and utilized forms

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:10%
of resonance and vibration--

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:10%
in other words, lost
ancient high technology.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lost ancient
high technology.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.918 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That is amazing.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And what Brien
mentioned, the quarries

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:84%
were often many miles
away, and up and over

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.248 align:middle line:90%
through river valleys as well.

00:05:29.248 --> 00:05:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Why would they go
to so much trouble?

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean
to tell me they

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:84%
put blocks on rollers of wood
trunks and pulled it along?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Come on.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.477 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't tell you
that either, George.

00:05:40.477 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is, we were
way up above the tree line.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Trees only grow to about 12,000
feet, and as Brian mentioned,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:84%
they're just shrubbery
trees as well.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So they wouldn't have
the big logs anyways

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:84%
to do this kind of pulling and
rolling of these giant blocks.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Plus, they would just
smash the wood anyways.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.602 align:middle line:90%
They're so big and heavy.

00:05:58.602 --> 00:05:59.768 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they have?

00:05:59.768 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:90%
High technology?

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.252 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We could
say that there were

00:06:02.252 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
some kind of technology
employed that we're still

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:90%
not understanding.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:10%
Where that came from, I
guess, is the big question,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:10%
because to get some of
these blocks from a quarry--

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:10%
for example, another site we
visited called Ollantaytambo,

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:10%
it's way up on a mountain
top, down a valley

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:10%
floor, across a
river, and then up

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle line:10%
another mountain to place
them at this location called

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:10%
the Valley of the Sun.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.783 align:middle line:84%
How did they get them
from point A to point B?

00:06:31.783 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
anybody's guess.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.745 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Sometimes the
road is not even existent.

00:06:35.745 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm glad we
looked at the video too, Brad,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:84%
because it showed us how
you were talking about how

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
some of the stones were cut
out in a circular type fashion,

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and they just fit right into
another piece perfectly.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So we are talking about
techniques called cold fusion,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
or cold plasma techniques, or
possibly using certain minerals

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
or elements to make
the stone soft--

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:84%
make the stone soft
and then fit it

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle line:84%
so you get that precise
fit at a curvature angle.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, you create
these polygon blocks that

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.830 align:middle line:84%
fit together so precisely that,
because of all the earthquakes

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.130 align:middle line:84%
that have hit South America,
being on the Ring of Fire,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:84%
those constructions
are still very

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
much in place, where the newer
ones on top of the older blocks

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:84%
have since crumbled and
are not in such good shape.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah that object
there looked earthquake-proof.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about that
structure itself.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So this was
filmed at SacsayhuamÃ¡n,

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.530 align:middle line:84%
which is above
the city of Cusco,

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:84%
which also has a wealth
of megalithic sites.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the largest
blocks in the Americas,

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:90%
as Brien pointed out.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about 20 feet tall.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tons and tons.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Many, many tons.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's this wall that
just undulates in and out,

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%
in and out, several layers up on
one side of a flat area, which

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:90%
was used for ritual purposes.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And there were
other features here,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.323 align:middle line:84%
which included
underground chambers

00:08:15.323 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:90%
that you could walk through.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:90%
So you go into pitch black.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:84%
That may affect
a person's light.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And we also saw evidence
of a major cataclysm--

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that there were massive
boulders that were upended,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.530 align:middle line:90%
with staircases underneath.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Nobody would do
that for any reason.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you see this,
Brad, up front and personal,

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.088 align:middle line:90%
does it shock you?

00:08:37.088 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It really does,
because what you're looking at

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:84%
is something like the Great
Pyramids, that still defies

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:84%
explanation, and is
so massive in scale

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:84%
you just have to wonder,
why would they build so big?

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be easier
to do smaller blocks?

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:90%
They built to impress.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.263 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about
auditive levitation.

00:08:59.263 --> 00:09:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well,
this is a technique

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:84%
where you're matching the
sound waves of matter.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're talking
about a science that

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:90%
is still not yet understood.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Now you could watch
YouTube videos

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and see bowling balls
levitated, or mice that

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:90%
are still squirming around.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem to
hurt living organisms.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But levitation is
a real technology

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:90%
that we're discovering.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.217 align:middle line:84%
Now, how they do it on such
a large scale and levitate--

00:09:24.217 --> 00:09:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't know that yet.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.883 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: We don't know that yet.

00:09:26.883 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ed Leedskalnin
at Coral Castle

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:10%
down in Homestead, Florida used
something I think very similar.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And he also said he knew
the secrets of the pyramids.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.663 align:middle line:84%
Somebody somewhere has
lost this technology.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It has
been lost in time,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps now it's
finally being rediscovered.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And it does tie in many of
these megalithic sites that

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.355 align:middle line:84%
don't have an explanation for
how these massive blocks were

00:09:52.355 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:90%
moved.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Now we can start
talking about it

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
in new science kind
of ways, which maybe

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:90%
perhaps this ancient science.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you agree with
Brien Foerster's assessment

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:90%
about, who knows how?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I do, as well as
the aging of these sites.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:10%
Just as in the same way that
Robert Schoch has re-dated

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:10%
the Sphinx in Egypt, Brien and
Nassim Haramein are leading

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:10%
the charge with the new
science, understanding that

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.490 align:middle line:10%
the pre-Incans--

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:10%
not the Incas themselves,
but a culture many thousands

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:10%
of years older, that
were pre-cataclysmistic,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:10%
that they were here before there
were some great Earth changes.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, we saw evidence
at many of these sites

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.670 align:middle line:84%
that there was some kind of
cataclysm that moved around

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
some of these megalithic
blocks, or even tumbled

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.875 align:middle line:90%
over other ones.

00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, where
did they go, Brad?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Because wherever they may
be, they took this technology

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Maybe they
took it to the grave.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.267 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they were the ancestors
of Atlantis who had survived,

00:10:56.267 --> 00:10:58.225 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps they were the
Atlanteans themselves.

00:10:58.225 --> 00:11:01.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But should there
not be some of them left?

00:11:01.145 --> 00:11:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Maybe they're us,
many generations later.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But how did
we lose the knowledge?

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.245 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:11:07.245 --> 00:11:08.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the one thing
I don't understand

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:90%
about the pyramids in Egypt.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Somebody knew how it happened.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Somebody knew how it worked.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Why did we seem to lose that
knowledge of all these places?

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:90%
There seems to be a gap.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, there
does seem to be a cycle

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:90%
that we go through on Earth.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:84%
The Indians call
it the Kali Yuga

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have just come
through, a period of forgetting

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:90%
or a period of amnesia.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:10%
And of course, our friend Eric
von Daniken speaks of history

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:10%
is a lie, and we're in
this period of amnesia,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:10%
and we're just coming out of it.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of technology to
build megaliths on this scale

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
may not seem practical in
construction terms today,

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
but I think they are leaving
behind clues saying, hey,

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.190 align:middle line:84%
this is what we are
able to achieve.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe someday you'll
be able to replicate.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You agree with that?

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Well, I think there's
hardly any other explanations

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.370 align:middle line:10%
to build on such a scale.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's the aesthetics
of seeing something

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.873 align:middle line:84%
so big and beautiful,
but also the impression

00:12:10.873 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:84%
you gain when you're standing
right in front of it--

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.315 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --and seeing something
almost as tall as the ceilins

00:12:15.315 --> 00:12:15.460 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got
to be awe-inspiring.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.692 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It truly is.

00:12:17.692 --> 00:12:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're dealing
with several things.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.220 align:middle line:84%
One is, how did they
get the blocks there?

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:84%
How did they cut
the blocks there?

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.510 align:middle line:84%
How did they then
lift the blocks

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.870 align:middle line:84%
at the site to build a
structure, the megalith?

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And we see no signs
of chisel marks either.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:84%
But you have this
marshmallowing effect.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So the boulders not only
show no signs of chiseling,

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.380 align:middle line:84%
have exact precise fits, but
kind of bulge out a little bit,

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and once in a while will have
these little nodes like--

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:84%
if we're talking about using
this cold plasma technology,

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.860 align:middle line:90%
it was a cooling effect.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And when it cooled,
gravity brought

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:84%
it down and sometimes
created these little knobs

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.880 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of the megalith
that conventional archeologists

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:84%
still have no explanation
why they're there.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How intelligent
were past civilizations?

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I think
they're not getting

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:16.970 align:middle line:84%
the kind of credibility
or street cred,

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.333 align:middle line:90%
so to speak that they should.

00:13:18.333 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They deserve.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.375 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That they deserve.

00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, they have done
things that we still can't even

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:90%
replicate.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.273 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that is
an incredible question.

00:13:26.273 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Here we are 3,000,
4,000, 5,000 years later,

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and we still can't figure
out how they did it.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.613 align:middle line:90%
Something's weird here.

00:13:35.613 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Do you remember? about
a decade ago in Japan they

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:42.597 align:middle line:84%
tried to replicate a small scale
version of the Great Pyramid,

00:13:42.597 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:90%
and they failed miserably.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They couldn't do it.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Couldn't do it.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They couldn't do it.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So we
couldn't even try to do

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.085 align:middle line:84%
some of these megalithic
buildings in South America

00:13:51.085 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:90%
if we tried.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:84%
There just isn't the crane
capacity or the building

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:90%
capacity to do such things.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So we must be talking
about a new science,

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:84%
or a forgotten science
that perhaps we're

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:90%
just rediscovering.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does your
gut tell you about this?

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.288 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: My gut
tells me that there

00:14:08.288 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
was an antediluvian
civilization on this planet that

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.170 align:middle line:90%
had high technology.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.305 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps not nearly as many
people as we are today, but--

00:14:16.305 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And tools?

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Tools, but perhaps
of a different variety.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Tools not so much of a--

>>NOORY: Laser cutters?

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You're kind of
going in that direction.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm getting close.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:84%
There's a clip from "Monumental
Mystery" about Machu Picchu.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And I want to look
at the clip, and then

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:84%
have you tell us
about Machu Picchu,

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:84%
because that comes up
a lot in discussion.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Sure.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.980 align:middle line:10%
- But is there better evidence
elsewhere of a much older

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.640 align:middle line:10%
knowledge at work?

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:10%
The answer may lie at what is
South America's crowning glory,

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:10%
Machu Picchu.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:53.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:10%
The magnificent site
lay hidden from view

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:10%
in the highland jungle until an
American archaeologist stumbled

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:10%
upon it in 1911.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:10%
It is commonly
dated by the study

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:10%
of the human remains found there
at between 1,000 to 1,500 years

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.500 align:middle line:10%
old.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:10%
In the search for some
dissenting voices on the issue,

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:10%
Hancock mentions only
one-- a German scholar

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:10%
working in the 1930s
who said that it

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:10%
was conceivable that
the site may date back

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:10%
2,000 to 3,000 years.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:10%
He arrived at this dating by
aligning the constellations

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:10%
of the stars with
points on the ground,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:10%
suggesting that they
would only have matched

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.720 align:middle line:10%
two or three millennia ago.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.560 align:middle line:10%
Professor Ballon of Lima
University cannot agree with

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.965 align:middle line:10%
this radical re-dating
of Machu Picchu.

00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:10%
But we have a
precise chronology.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.180 align:middle line:10%
Machu Picchu has been
radiocarbon dated

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:45.695 align:middle line:10%
at between 1450 and 1470 AD.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:10%
Hancock also brings
to his argument

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.460 align:middle line:10%
the legend of the Viracoches.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.990 align:middle line:10%
This is a local
legend that speaks

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:10%
of a race of wise
and bearded men

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.970 align:middle line:10%
from the mountains who made
this city long ago, long

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.095 align:middle line:10%
before the Incas existed.

00:15:57.095 --> 00:16:01.955 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.955 --> 00:16:03.560 align:middle line:10%
This is no more than a legend.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:10%
Peruvian culture
stands on its own.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:10%
It began in 10,000 BC
and ended with the Incas.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:10%
The available
scientific evidence

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.304 align:middle line:10%
would seem to suggest
that this is a product.

00:16:18.304 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.167 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's amazing
about that, too, Brad,

00:16:21.167 --> 00:16:23.210 align:middle line:84%
just looking at it,
would be the amount

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
of stones that they used, and
they don't seem to fall off

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're not
cemented, are they?

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:90%
There's no masonry involved.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:84%
They're just fitted
together so precisely.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you see
the oldest and the lowest

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
megalithic blocks are the best
preserved and constructed.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:47.570 align:middle line:84%
There is in that video clip a
shot of the Temple of the Sun,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and there are two
windows that you

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:84%
can see the solstice sunrise
come right through the window.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's a
very popular day

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
to go to Machu Picchu,
when the sun comes

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:90%
streaming right through.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.350 align:middle line:84%
We were there just a few weeks
before the summer solstice.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.839 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What can you tell
us about Machu Picchu?

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's a fascinating site
that was buried in jungle only

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:84%
110 years ago, before Hiram
Bingham hiked up the Inca Trail

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:90%
and discovered it--

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:84%
a scholar much like
an Indiana Jones,

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:84%
coming from a university
background, Yale University,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and finding it
covered in jungle.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But it also had very venomous
snakes, so it took a while,

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and many people died,
to clear out the jungle.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Attacked by snakes?

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Sure.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, horrible.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Horrible.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.982 align:middle line:84%
What makes Machu
Picchu so remarkable?

00:17:37.982 --> 00:17:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: First of
all, the setting.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.290 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about an 8,900 foot

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:84%
plateau which is held by
several series of terraces.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
There are three kinds of
terraces at Machu Picchu.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
One are for erosion control,
others are agricultural,

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and other kinds of terraces were
used for ceremonial purposes.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:90%
So it was a very sacred place.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.340 align:middle line:84%
How they got them there
and how they placed them so

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:84%
precisely is one of the great
mysteries of Machu Picchu.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You narrated a
video on Machu Picchu.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Mm.

00:18:12.956 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:90%
- Yes, here we are.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:84%
The terraces above incredibly
beautiful Machu Picchu.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.686 align:middle line:90%
That is Hiram Picchu.

00:18:28.686 --> 00:18:35.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the deep valley below,
with jagged-peak mountains.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Moving way up there, some
snow-peaked mountains.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.432 align:middle line:84%

the view of Machu Picchu.

that city flourishing back

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.075 align:middle line:90%
in its heyday?

00:18:53.075 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Turns out, there
weren't even that many people--

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:84%
just a few hundred,
because that's

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
all the agricultural
terraces would support.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
It was very much
a royal enclave.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure was.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Amazingly enough,
George, water still flows.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.923 align:middle line:84%
You could still take
a drink of water.

00:19:08.923 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like it always did?

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Like it always did.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And water, of course, would
be critical to agriculture

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:90%
and, of course, drinking.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it one of
the wonders of the world?

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It was.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it was only
discovered 108 years ago,

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:84%
but it's in the modern wonders
of the world category--

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:84%
not of the ancient
wonders, which

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:90%
only the Great Pyramid exists.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a ritual
stone at Machu Picchu.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.480 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, that is
the Inti Raymi Stone,

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
on top of a plateau where
this carved stone right out

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.580 align:middle line:84%
of the living rock
acts as a sundial,

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.920 align:middle line:90%
and seasons can be predicted--

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.590 align:middle line:84%
which, if you think, if you
were a mostly agricultural--

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You need to know that.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:84%

need to know that information.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

Your life depends on it.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they must have
had some kind of scientists

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:84%
available during that
time period, too?

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We think there were
more high priests of shaman

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that would interpret
the seasons,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and look at the sun rays
coming through these windows

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
in the Temple of the Sun
to understand the planting

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.223 align:middle line:90%
seasons, the rainy seasons.

00:20:09.223 --> 00:20:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you
learn about Machu Picchu

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:11.940 align:middle line:90%
on this trip?

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: For one, it
was everything people

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:90%
have thought it to be.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
It is equally impressive,
or even overwhelming--

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
the scale, the proportion, the
amount of megalithic stones

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:90%
that could be found.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Just every turn you
make, it's something

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:90%
that just is awe-inspiring.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the setting
that it's in, with the giant

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.520 align:middle line:90%
jagged mountains all around--

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and the sacred Hiram
Picchu right there, too,

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:45.540 align:middle line:84%
which is in the shape of
a face lying on its back.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.070 align:middle line:84%
It was a sacred place
because it was believed

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
that this was a
shaman in the rock,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.930 align:middle line:84%
that it was a living entity that
the people were living inside

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:90%
of.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the Incan culture,
weren't they of small stature?

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yes, very
small stature to be

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:90%
able to move these blocks.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
But the re-dating
of these stones,

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:84%
as Graham Hancock mentioned,
and Brien Foerster and Nassim

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Harriman, that there was
pre-Incan architecture there

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:90%
pre-existing.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:10%
The Incans merely
came in and said, hey,

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.740 align:middle line:10%
this is a great
site already here.

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we just add
a few things onto it?

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can clearly see
the two building styles--

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:84%
one megalithic,
finely cut, precisely

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:84%
fitted, and others of a more
inferior nature on top of that.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they came into the
system of a civilization that

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
has been gone that may have
built this, and simply said,

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.380 align:middle line:84%
we want to do a little
cosmetic change to it.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And make the Incan
road a little bit better,

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:90%
and you can hike up to it.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:84%
George, there are hundreds of
miles, perhaps a 1,000 miles

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.660 align:middle line:90%
of Inca Trail to get there.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's how Hiram
Bingham found the site.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
carve out the trails?

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Right from
the living rock,

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.990 align:middle line:90%
placing stones, building steps.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's also megalithic
buildings along the way, too.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
On our second day there, we
did a hike up the Inca Trail

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.960 align:middle line:84%
to another Temple of the Sun,
where the solstice sunrise

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.030 align:middle line:84%
comes right through
the Temple of the Sun,

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:22.400 align:middle line:84%
then five miles away into that
window at the Temple of the Sun

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.200 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So they had a precise
knowledge of the seasons

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:90%
and the rising of the sun.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:84%
It just leads me to
believe that, again, there

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of lost
science or lost knowledge

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.748 align:middle line:84%
that these people employed
in their building.

00:22:36.748 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
anything there that

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.205 align:middle line:84%
looks like it could
be a UFO landing pad?

00:22:41.205 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's what Nassim
kept saying, that there

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.143 align:middle line:84%
was a big platform, a big
terrace a little bit lower,

00:22:47.143 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:90%
and he kept pointing it out.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.340 align:middle line:84%
That's where you
could land the craft!

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, maybe?

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: We're leaving it open.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:90%
There was certainly--

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
move these stones.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Something that it's
moving these stones, something

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:84%
that compelled them to build
at a very difficult location.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Why not just build
down in the valley,

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:11.193 align:middle line:84%
where it'd be much easier
to take a boat or walk?

00:23:11.193 --> 00:23:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you walked
around it and looked at it,

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.410 align:middle line:90%
what did you think?

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That it was
highly protective,

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.130 align:middle line:84%
that if you wanted to hide
away from, say, an enemy--

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:84%
if the Incans or
even the pre-Incans

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.780 align:middle line:84%
wanted to keep their
royal family safe,

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:84%
that it would be a very
protected spot, because it's

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:84%
just basically sheer cliff
walls on three sides of it,

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and then a very
narrow Inca Trail

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:90%
to access it from another way.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about these
three terraces.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So the three
terraces were ceremonial,

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.160 align:middle line:84%
all around the main
ceremonial area,

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
where people of the city could
come out on important days

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and the high priest could
perform rituals and--

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sacrifices?

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Were they into that
kind of culture?

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.950 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: I don't
recall any bodies being

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.270 align:middle line:10%
found in a sacrificial manner.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But they did
have some caves there.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.027 align:middle line:84%
There is a cave system
underneath Machu Picchu.

00:24:07.027 --> 00:24:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Underneath?

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh yeah.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sophisticated?

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Sophisticated.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And it looks-- they wouldn't
let us in there, unfortunately,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.280 align:middle line:84%
but it does look
like there was some--

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why didn't
they let you in?

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, maybe
because there's so

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:17.973 align:middle line:90%
many people that go there.

00:24:17.973 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:84%
It is the most visited
site in South America.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, and just so
many thousands of people

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:90%
visit every day.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
capacity for doing that.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they
think it could collapse?

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Perhaps, or just
people get stuck in there

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.840 align:middle line:90%
or claustrophobic.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.298 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, maybe there's
something else in there that--

00:24:34.298 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I would
think there might be.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:36.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the other
terraces had to do

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:84%
with the agricultural
farming of the area,

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and also propping
it up, because we're

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.750 align:middle line:84%
talking about a major
plateau on an isthmus of land

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.910 align:middle line:90%
between two mountains.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:54.137 align:middle line:84%
And if it rains a lot there,
there would be erosion.

00:24:54.137 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything slides down.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Mudslides.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine this
all falling apart.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But again, what's
fascinating is,

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the
rocks, the stones,

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:84%
they're just perfectly
put together.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.180 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:84%
There must be thousands
of stones out there!

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Thousands and
thousands of stones,

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:90%
so precisely put together.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:10%
Some of the historians that
I heard talking to other tour

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:21.090 align:middle line:10%
groups will say that
this was the royal Incan

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.760 align:middle line:10%
style of creating
these megaliths,

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:10%
that they just put more
attention into doing it.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But since the whole
compound was for royalty,

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.200 align:middle line:84%
why not do everything
in that way?

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Why would there be inferior
stone constructions

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:40.200 align:middle line:84%
on top of very sophisticated
megalithic blocks?

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you tell,
Brad, if the structure

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:43.650 align:middle line:90%
had rooms to it?

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what were the
rooms for, do you think?

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.778 align:middle line:90%
Were they quarters to sleep?

00:25:47.778 --> 00:25:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: There were
definitely rooms.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:84%
There were some rooms
that had windows that

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:90%
were very strategically placed.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:84%
There were also buildings
with arched roofs

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that would have had
wood or thatched

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.550 align:middle line:90%
roofs that are since long gone.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:10%
There were housing
areas for royalty.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:08.400 align:middle line:84%
There were housing areas for
agricultural workers, which

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:90%
were more inferior in design.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.050 align:middle line:84%
There were also-- you
could see pole holes

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:19.420 align:middle line:84%
for second-story dwellings,
and very sophisticated designs,

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:84%
including little
holes for chimneys,

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.115 align:middle line:90%
building fires in there.

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
other places do

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.410 align:middle line:84%
you think could be like Machu
Picchu which we haven't even

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.670 align:middle line:90%
found yet?

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: There could
still be some out there.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.030 align:middle line:84%
The jungles are
still very thick.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Remember, there were some sonar
scans of the Amazon jungle,

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and they did find a city with
pyramids completely covered

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.230 align:middle line:84%
in forest and jungle
that I don't believe

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:90%
has been excavated yet.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
still find new pyramids

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.560 align:middle line:84%
in the jungles of
Central America that

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.940 align:middle line:90%
are linked to the Mayans.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is remarkable.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Are other scientists
looking at this area?

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:90%
And if so, what are they saying?

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, they should
be, because it really

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.250 align:middle line:84%
does redefine what we
know about ancient people

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:90%
and their building techniques.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why aren't
we investigating this?

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.517 align:middle line:90%
We've got the science to do it.

00:27:10.517 --> 00:27:12.350 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: It seems that
there are roadblocks.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:16.020 align:middle line:84%
It seems there are certain
institutions, perhaps

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:84%
some of our learning
institutions

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:84%
that like this cookie-cutter
model of history,

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.960 align:middle line:84%
that think that Columbus
made this unique discovery

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:84%
of a continent that was already
occupied by millions of people,

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:84%
or that they didn't
have technology

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.530 align:middle line:90%
that's above our own.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:84%
It's almost egocentric to
think that an antediluvian

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.670 align:middle line:84%
civilization could have
had building techniques

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:84%
that we still don't
understand today.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, tell us
about Lake Titicaca.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Lake Titicaca is
the highest alpine lake

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.590 align:middle line:90%
in the world, also the largest.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.210 align:middle line:84%
It's so large, George, you
can't even see across it.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:90%
It's over 100 miles in length--

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --from north to south.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
replenishes the lake?

00:27:59.975 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, there are
streams that are seasonal,

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and rivers sometimes
that dry up,

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and others that will have
glacier melt that fill it up.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.010 align:middle line:84%
There are many streams and
rivers that come into it,

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and only one exit
river out, and that

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:19.620 align:middle line:84%
goes down to the salt plains
called Salar de Uyuni, also

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:90%
in Bolivia.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
been on the lake.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I have, in
Peru and Bolivia,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.455 align:middle line:90%
out to several of the islands.

00:28:25.455 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN (ON VIDEO): Cruise
along on Lake Titicaca.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.190 align:middle line:90%
This is the Peru side.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:51.288 align:middle line:84%
Here's our other sister ships,
coming out of the Bay of Puno

00:28:51.288 --> 00:28:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and heading out to a couple
of the islands for a day

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:84%
trip on Lake Titicaca,
the largest alpine

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.470 align:middle line:90%
lake in the world.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.930 align:middle line:90%
You weren't kidding.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
fish in that lake?

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: There are.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.540 align:middle line:10%
There are fish that are
unique to that lake.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.430 align:middle line:84%
There's also underwater
ruins on the Bolivian side

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.180 align:middle line:84%
that they discovered
a couple decades ago.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind of ruins?

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.105 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Megalithic block ruins.

00:29:17.105 --> 00:29:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Machu Picchu?

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Underwater roads.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Not quite of that quality
or high level of building,

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.680 align:middle line:84%
but enough to say that there
are underwater ruins in Lake

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Titicaca.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:84%
What's also remarkable is, there
is a freshwater seahorse that

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.810 align:middle line:90%
lives in only Lake Titicaca.

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:84%
That would give some
credibility to the fact that

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:84%
at one time, maybe Lake Titicaca
had been connected to the sea,

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and had rose up in
this cataclysmic event

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
that we hear of-- perhaps a
pole shift that moved continents

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.260 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:10%
And the seahorses were
trapped in the lake,

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.720 align:middle line:10%
and just adapted to
freshwater as the salinity had

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.900 align:middle line:10%
changed with all the freshwater
streams coming into it.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lake
Titicaca is considered

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.690 align:middle line:90%
to be pretty legendary.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:04.760 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well it
is the origin point

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:12.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Incan people from
the Island of the Sun,

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and the Island of the Moon
are two very sacred islands

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.110 align:middle line:90%
on the Bolivian side.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:22.130 align:middle line:10%
It is the emergence point
where the Incan people believe

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.820 align:middle line:10%
that they came out of
the Earth and emerged

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.120 align:middle line:10%
onto the planetscape.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
you just mentioned

00:30:27.495 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:90%
the Island of the Sun.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Pictures are worth
a thousand words.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:37.260 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.165 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN (ON VIDEO): Here is the
top of the Island of the Sun.

00:30:40.165 --> 00:30:57.482 align:middle line:90%


00:30:57.482 --> 00:31:03.000 align:middle line:84%
There's the Island of the
Moon, and Bolivia side.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Big white-capped mountains.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And Lake Titicaca, the
largest, highest navigable lake

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.530 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:15.123 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did I just noticed a
lot of snow on those mountains?

00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: You sure did.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.860 align:middle line:84%
It's ringed by snow-capped
mountains on all sides.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that must
help feed the lake as well.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Correct.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:84%
The glaciers that
melt feed the lake.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, the one
thing I didn't notice

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.900 align:middle line:84%
is, I didn't see any population
around the lake at all.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Is it pretty desolate?

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It's fairly desolate.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:10%
There are villages, but
they're pretty small.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.090 align:middle line:10%
Being at such a
high elevation, I

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:10%
think living up at that level is
quite challenging in the amount

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.220 align:middle line:10%
of crops you can grow.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.390 align:middle line:10%
You did notice some agricultural
terraces there on the Island

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.360 align:middle line:10%
of the Sun, and people
do still raise llamas

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.780 align:middle line:10%
and grow in the agricultural
terraces some crop.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close is
that to the Nazca Lines

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that Eric von Daniken
and wrote about

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.420 align:middle line:90%
in "Chariots of the Gods"?

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, that
is down the slope

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:06.200 align:middle line:84%
on the Peruvian side, probably
about 300 or 400 miles away,

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.415 align:middle line:90%
on the Nazca Plateau.

00:32:07.415 --> 00:32:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That far?

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Peru's a pretty big country.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.595 align:middle line:10%
It's probably about
the size of California.

00:32:12.595 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
secret about this region?

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:84%
We looked at Machu Picchu with
its incredible stone blocks

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:18.620 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.450 align:middle line:84%
This, I see, is just
the wonder of God.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It is.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:28.700 align:middle line:10%
It's such a beautiful, sacred
lake to the Incan people,

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:10%
to the cultures that
still live there.

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.680 align:middle line:10%
The Bolivian people,
too, are equally

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.380 align:middle line:10%
colorful in their
clothing, and they still

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:10%
come out there and do rituals.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.535 align:middle line:84%
There are some reed
boats that are there

00:32:41.535 --> 00:32:43.160 align:middle line:84%
on the Island of the
Sun, where they'll

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:84%
come out on solstice dates and
other important ritual dates.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's still very
important to the people

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.555 align:middle line:84%
to go there as a
pilgrimage site.

00:32:51.555 --> 00:32:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad tell
us a little bit more

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.650 align:middle line:90%
about the Island of the Sun.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what is it?

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it is one of
the largest islands in Lake

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Titicaca, and it's
special because there

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.140 align:middle line:90%
are megalithic buildings there.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:84%
There are old temple
sites and ruins

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.410 align:middle line:84%
that you can visit, as well
as just being so beautiful,

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.680 align:middle line:84%
as we saw, with views
in all directions.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Kind of reminded me
of the Greek islands,

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:84%
looking out at the vast
landscape in the Aegean Sea

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.990 align:middle line:90%
with other different islands.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And in Incan culture, there is
always a male and female side.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.690 align:middle line:84%
The Island of the Sun
was the male side,

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.240 align:middle line:84%
where the Island of the Moon,
which we saw in the video

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:84%
clip-- much smaller,
but more feminine.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And there were flowers that were
laid out in mandala boutiques.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:46.070 align:middle line:84%
The temples were more
modest and more rounded,

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:90%
as a woman may be.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's the dichotomy
of the two-- the male

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and the female, the
masculine and the feminine,

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.130 align:middle line:84%
which was worshipped
by the Incan people,

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.020 align:middle line:84%
and can be seen in
their architecture

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and how they interpreted the
lay of the land, these islands.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel anything
metaphysical about this region?

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.550 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: You can't help but
feel it's a very spiritual site

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.940 align:middle line:10%
to the people.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think, in
metaphysical ways,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.330 align:middle line:84%
it's infectious on the
visitor to go there and visit

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:21.920 align:middle line:84%
these places and to be able
to go and see the same things

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:84%
that the Incan people did, go
up the steps that they built.

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Inca Trail continues on
here in Lake Titicaca as well.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The two
boats that you used

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:37.280 align:middle line:10%
when you cruised Lake Titicaca
in that island area, were they

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.179 align:middle line:10%
stationed there?

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:39.860 align:middle line:10%
Or do-- how did
they get them there?

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, that was out
of the Bay of Puno, which

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:90%
was on the Peruvian side.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And we are going out to
some of the islands that

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:56.840 align:middle line:84%
still have the most intact
genetic people of Incan origin.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.330 align:middle line:10%
Until most recent
times, when the people

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:10%
could leave the island,
there was a problem

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.400 align:middle line:10%
with interbreeding, because
they had just been so isolated

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.320 align:middle line:10%
on some of these islands.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But it had retained
their genetic structure

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.960 align:middle line:84%
more than other
places where people

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.150 align:middle line:90%
had intermingled a lot more.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
breeding with relatives?

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Sometimes.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like that's
what you were saying, yeah.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did that
create any problems?

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It did.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:10%
There were some
diseases that could

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.990 align:middle line:10%
take hold a little easier.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Now they're encouraging
the younger people

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:36.320 align:middle line:84%
to intermingle more, to
go to the mainland more.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
that has also led

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.680 align:middle line:84%
to the culture being watered
down and not adhered to.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.940 align:middle line:10%
And some of the local dialects
are starting to die out,

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.860 align:middle line:10%
and some of the languages
are starting to fade.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
is an Incan culture?

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Correct-- the
remnants of the Incans,

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the Peruvian people
who still retain

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
much of the genetic
stock of the Incans.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:84%
So they do look very indigenous
they still wear pretty

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:06.290 align:middle line:90%
much the indigenous clothes.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But some of them are
wearing Western clothes.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
language that they're

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.850 align:middle line:84%
trying to help keep preserve,
but about 40, 50 years ago,

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.720 align:middle line:84%
they discouraged it from
being learned in school,

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted everybody
to speak Spanish.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
difference between the Inca

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:24.567 align:middle line:90%
and the Mayan cultures?

00:36:24.567 --> 00:36:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well,
geographically, they're

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:29.870 align:middle line:84%
quite different, being Central
America and South America.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.665 align:middle line:84%
Both high cultures that
built in megalithic--

00:36:32.665 --> 00:36:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Very
intelligent people.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Highly intelligent,
highly productive

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.840 align:middle line:90%
agricultural growing regions.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And had these
incredible monuments

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that they built for their
culture and their religions.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do you think
the indigenous population might

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.736 align:middle line:90%
have been in that area?

00:36:55.736 --> 00:36:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: In the area
of Peru and Bolivia,

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.620 align:middle line:84%
probably not more
than a million or two.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.270 align:middle line:90%
It's grown since, but--

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.275 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seems like a
lot, but it's not, is it?

00:37:04.275 --> 00:37:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It would
seem like it's a lot,

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:84%
but you have to understand,
the Incan empire at its height

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.870 align:middle line:84%
went all the way from the
country of what is now

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Columbia all the way down to
northern Chile and southern

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Bolivia.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's a span of about
1,500 miles, all connected

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:23.060 align:middle line:90%
with this Inca road system.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Pretty
dramatic, isn't it, Brad?

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Truly dramatic, to
think that they could build up

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and over the Andean mountains--
which are the second-highest

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:84%
mountain range in the world,
only after the Himalayas--

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:39.080 align:middle line:84%
but to have this
intricate road system that

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.750 align:middle line:84%
could go through
valleys, over mountains,

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and up on the Altiplano, this
very high treeless plain.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a truly remarkable
feat of building.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about Tiahuanacu.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Tiahuanacu is one
of the most sacred places

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.840 align:middle line:90%
off the shore of Lake Titicaca.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the only site that is
recognized by all academics

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:02.990 align:middle line:90%
as being pre-Incan.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And it is also featuring
many megalithic blocks

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and showing signs of
a great cataclysm that

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.417 align:middle line:90%
had destroyed much of the site.

00:38:12.417 --> 00:38:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:14.575 align:middle line:90%
Like an earthquake, you think?

00:38:14.575 --> 00:38:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well,
something that was

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:20.570 align:middle line:84%
able to fling megalithic
blocks in multiple directions.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I would say even more
than just an earthquake,

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.000 align:middle line:84%
but some kind of
massive cataclysm.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had to have
happened from beneath

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:90%
and then pushed it out, right?

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It would seem
so, because at the site

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:35.000 align:middle line:84%
called Puma Punku, which
is only a kilometer away

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.470 align:middle line:90%
from Tiahuanacu.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:38.810 align:middle line:84%
it's just scattered
about like a Lego

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:40.672 align:middle line:90%
set that just got destroyed.

00:38:40.672 --> 00:38:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's unbelievable.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.443 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of
bizarre, isn't it?

00:38:43.443 --> 00:38:45.110 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: It is kind
of bizarre, but when

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:49.490 align:middle line:10%
put in perspective with some of
the other signs of a cataclysm

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:53.630 align:middle line:10%
that we saw in Peru and
other sites in Bolivia,

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:10%
it kind of makes sense that
this whole region perhaps

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:03.290 align:middle line:10%
came rising up from the ocean
area, and some of these ruins

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:07.160 align:middle line:10%
were in a state of ruin because
they had just been broken up.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And as we spoke of with these
megalithic blocks, usually

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:12.980 align:middle line:90%
they can retain their structure.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But maybe this region
had a little bit more

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.100 align:middle line:84%
shaking than the
other regions, and was

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.430 align:middle line:84%
more in a state of
disrepair than some

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:23.930 align:middle line:90%
of the megalithic sites in Peru.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a
look at some of your work.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.360 align:middle line:90%


00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN (ON VIDEO): Here we are
in the semi-subterranean temple

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:40.640 align:middle line:84%
at Tiahuanacu, one of the
most famous and photographed

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:48.320 align:middle line:84%
locations of this pre-Inca
temple and political complex,

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:55.450 align:middle line:84%
with these very enigmatic
faces where all but six

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:56.780 align:middle line:90%
are originals.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Some look like skulls.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Some look like
aliens with bug eyes.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were
the priestly caste.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they were royalty.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:14.390 align:middle line:90%


00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were people
that lived here,

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.620 align:middle line:90%
that worshipped here.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:25.366 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they were something
altogether different.

00:40:25.366 --> 00:40:30.500 align:middle line:84%
It appears that these white ones
are the artificial ones, where

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:36.110 align:middle line:84%
all the rest are
originals, according

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:43.100 align:middle line:90%
to the placard just above.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, when this temple
was discovered,

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:49.610 align:middle line:84%
these walls were all
in a jumbled mess,

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.640 align:middle line:90%
including these heads.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And some archeologists,
like Brien Foerster,

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:02.330 align:middle line:84%
think that it was assembled
in a different way

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:06.050 align:middle line:84%
than it was originally,
and therefore thinks

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:12.650 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps this particular
site shouldn't be represented

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:13.670 align:middle line:90%
in the way it was.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:90%
But what's the alternative?

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Leaving it in a jumbled
mess, or giving us

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:33.308 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to see it in
its semi-reconstructed state?

00:41:33.308 --> 00:41:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was also
the location where

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:39.255 align:middle line:84%
they found the Pachamama
monolith, which

00:41:39.255 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:90%
is now in the museum.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.190 align:middle line:90%
7.3 meters tall.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And these monoliths were also
found here, and remain here.

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:84%
See the serpent
going up the side,

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and the hands pulling
ritual objects,

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and the long years
similar to Easter Island.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Quite a fascinating site.

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.870 align:middle line:84%
The semi-subterranean
temple at Tiahuanacu.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those were amazing.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Truly.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And those
figurines were bizarre.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They're very bizarre.

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.750 align:middle line:10%
And they're reminiscent of
the Easter Island heads, which

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:24.290 align:middle line:10%
also have the long ears
and holding ritual objects,

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.930 align:middle line:10%
or their hands
across their belly.

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They looked a little
extraterrestrial to me, Brad.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: With the big bug
eyes, the heads in the wall

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:33.800 align:middle line:90%
were very strange.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.560 align:middle line:84%
They do not look like humans
as we would know each other.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like they depicted
something that they saw.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Or perhaps
were visited by.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who were
the Viracocha people?

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Those are
the pre-Incans.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.228 align:middle line:84%
That is what's recognized
as the progenitor

00:42:48.228 --> 00:42:49.145 align:middle line:90%
race of South America.

00:42:49.145 --> 00:42:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're
convinced of that.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.850 align:middle line:10%
Even your most
standard archaeologist

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:10%
will agree that
Tiahuanacu is pre-Incan,

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.340 align:middle line:10%
and it shows signs that it had
led or influenced the Incans

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.840 align:middle line:10%
to build in the way they did.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they bring
to the table, the Viracocha?

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, you did see
some giant mega Lithia blocks

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.630 align:middle line:84%
in between the reconstructed
semi-subterranean temple there.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:15.057 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me a little
bit about Puma Punku.

00:43:15.057 --> 00:43:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Puma Punku.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Is this other site that's
just a kilometer away,

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:25.910 align:middle line:84%
but has these extremely
precisely cut blocks that many

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:29.950 align:middle line:84%
people have gone there to
examine and still cannot figure

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:35.390 align:middle line:84%
out how such hard stone such
as andesite could have such

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:41.750 align:middle line:84%
precisely cut right angles
built into the stone.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And again, this site is in a
state of complete disrepair.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.520 align:middle line:84%
There's really nothing
that fits together anymore.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything's just
in a jumbled mess.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.800 align:middle line:10%
But the stones are
so precisely cut

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.190 align:middle line:10%
that this is a very
important location

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:02.900 align:middle line:10%
to examine for the high
technology used in the stone

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.167 align:middle line:10%
cutting of these blocks.

00:44:04.167 --> 00:44:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, tell
me about the theme

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.870 align:middle line:84%
of your research, Nassim
Haramein's research, Brien

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:10.950 align:middle line:90%
Foerster's research.

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:13.760 align:middle line:10%
It's not just a travel log
of this incredible area

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.990 align:middle line:10%
in South America.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:18.050 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be a reason why
you're looking at these spots.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.515 align:middle line:90%
Tell me why.

00:44:19.515 --> 00:44:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We are
looking at them because

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:25.910 align:middle line:84%
of their incredible importance
in the historical record

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.250 align:middle line:84%
for high technology
being employed

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:32.030 align:middle line:84%
at these sites in a
very distant past.

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:34.100 align:middle line:90%
The timelines are not right.

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:38.900 align:middle line:84%
The technology acknowledgment
of how these things were built

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:39.770 align:middle line:90%
is not right.

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.530 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about chiseling them.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:45.720 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about high
machinery techniques--

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.830 align:middle line:10%
including some drill
holes, George--

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:51.795 align:middle line:10%
that are just so precise
that you couldn't bore them

00:44:51.795 --> 00:44:52.595 align:middle line:10%
out just using--

00:44:52.595 --> 00:44:53.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Drill holes?

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:53.965 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Drill holes.

00:44:53.965 --> 00:44:58.235 align:middle line:84%
Just perfectly rounded holes
at Puma Punku that just show--

00:44:58.235 --> 00:44:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just amazing.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:05.750 align:middle line:84%
These incredible, precisely
fit and engineered block

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:10.490 align:middle line:84%
techniques that our
machinery, using

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:14.900 align:middle line:84%
against very hard stone
with diamond cutters,

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.570 align:middle line:84%
are just able to do in
the last few decades.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, compare
this with the pyramids.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Do you see any
similarities here?

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I see
many similarities,

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:28.670 align:middle line:84%
and I spent a month in Egypt
going to all the sites.

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And what we find is some
similarities, such as in Peru,

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:90%
what looks like trowel marks--

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.620 align:middle line:84%
that stone could
have been shaped

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:40.970 align:middle line:90%
when it was in a different--

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or poured?

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --plasma form,
or poured, in Egypt,

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:48.350 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, as well as the
megalithic blocks that

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:50.540 align:middle line:90%
are so precisely fit together.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And in both cases,
George, the older

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:55.970 align:middle line:84%
the culture, the
higher technology

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:58.525 align:middle line:84%
and the more refined state that
these megaliths were built.

00:45:58.525 --> 00:46:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't we find
remnants of tools and artifacts

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and things like that
at these places?

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:08.510 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if they were
pilfered and taken away.

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Something happened to them.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And just like you don't see the
chisel marks in these stones--

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --there is some
kind of tool or technology

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:23.925 align:middle line:84%
that was employed that
has been lost to the ages.

00:46:23.925 --> 00:46:25.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's fascinating
to me, too, Brad,

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.910 align:middle line:10%
is not only the construction
of the structures,

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:33.720 align:middle line:10%
but the physical
cutting of the blocks--

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.840 align:middle line:10%
which were done five miles
away, or something like that--

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.720 align:middle line:10%
and then transported to them.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.930 align:middle line:10%
You're talking, again,
about thousands of blocks.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:46.600 align:middle line:84%
How many trips would that have
been with conventional travel?

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It boggles
the mind to think

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.410 align:middle line:84%
how long it would
have taken to build

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:51.755 align:middle line:90%
some of these constructions.

00:46:51.755 --> 00:46:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
ask yourself, why?

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Why would they go to such
lengths to build pyramids?

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.308 align:middle line:90%
And what were those used for?

00:46:58.308 --> 00:46:59.108 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:46:59.108 --> 00:47:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And there are
pyramids at Tiahuanacu as well,

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:02.380 align:middle line:90%
and Puma Punku.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.558 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they resemble
the pyramids of Giza?

00:47:04.558 --> 00:47:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They resemble more
of the pyramids of Sakkara.

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:10.530 align:middle line:84%
They're step pyramids that
go up at different layers.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:14.800 align:middle line:84%
There are levels to them, and
seven levels at the larger

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.132 align:middle line:90%
pyramid at Tiahuanacu.

00:47:16.132 --> 00:47:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But where's
the machinery?

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It's non-existent.

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it flown away?

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:23.402 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Or it was destroyed.

00:47:23.402 --> 00:47:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if I
were to say to you, Brad,

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.660 align:middle line:84%
I want one theory from you
of how these were built--

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:32.290 align:middle line:84%
just one-- what would
you say at this point?

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:33.410 align:middle line:90%
And you were there.

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:34.440 align:middle line:90%
You saw this.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I did see this.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I would say it was employing
auditive levitation.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:42.100 align:middle line:84%
It was moving blocks in ways
that we still can't quite

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.620 align:middle line:84%
understand how to
move heavy objects.

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.222 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you even cut
the blocks in the first place?

00:47:47.222 --> 00:47:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's the part two.

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:50.347 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then pull
them out of the quarry.

00:47:50.347 --> 00:47:51.560 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And how do you fit
them together like precise LEGO

00:47:55.030 --> 00:48:00.250 align:middle line:84%
blocks, in such a way that
they could withstand great--

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:01.295 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And aren't they fit together
before they're put together?

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Some of them are,
such as some of the megaliths

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that even have little
niches in the blocks when

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.370 align:middle line:90%
they're disassembled.

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:14.920 align:middle line:84%
They're found to fit
together even more precisely

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.260 align:middle line:84%
on top of each other,
much like Stonehenge

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:21.700 align:middle line:84%
has the little nodes where
the mega lists fit on top

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.620 align:middle line:90%
of the standing trioliths.

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could we make
these structures today

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.220 align:middle line:90%
with conventional equipment?

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They've
tried and failed.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't think our conventional
building technique is really--

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With cranes, with
saws, with everything we have,

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.300 align:middle line:90%
we could not duplicate this?

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It would be an
extreme cost to do it,

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and you'd have to
ask yourself, why?

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:47.110 align:middle line:10%
Why would you employ so much
labor, effort, and technology

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:50.080 align:middle line:10%
to build something
in such a large scale

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.690 align:middle line:10%
unless it was very important
to you and the builders

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:53.920 align:middle line:10%
to have it done this way?

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now, that is an
interesting thing you bring up.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.510 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the function
of these structures might be?

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Certainly ceremonial.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Somehow it had a
religious importance

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.940 align:middle line:84%
to the people, especially
the priestly caste who

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.710 align:middle line:84%
would have employed
the building of them,

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:15.580 align:middle line:84%
that they would have
really sensed that it was

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:17.573 align:middle line:90%
important to build in this way.

00:49:17.573 --> 00:49:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think these
structures-- now,

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.860 align:middle line:90%
this is my theory--

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.960 align:middle line:84%
that these places have some
way of pulling in the energy

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.430 align:middle line:90%
from the universe or the planet.

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:32.290 align:middle line:10%
And if you're there in
the middle of it, near it,

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:33.910 align:middle line:10%
you get energized.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think these things
are like healing apparatuses

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.340 align:middle line:90%
for the ancients at the time.

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:43.270 align:middle line:10%
I think, like most people
who go to a spa today,

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.500 align:middle line:10%
I think that's what they did.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.630 align:middle line:84%
I think they went
there, stood there

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:49.030 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of this
thing, got bombarded

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:52.560 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of things,
and they felt better.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.360 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.485 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You might be onto
something there, George,

00:49:55.485 --> 00:49:58.390 align:middle line:84%
in that there was some
kind of chamber aspect--

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:00.880 align:middle line:84%
just like in the King's Chamber
of the Great Pyramid that

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:05.410 align:middle line:84%
has a resonance effect of
being around the stones,

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:07.480 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps if they were
hit with a certain kind

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.437 align:middle line:84%
of frequency, might
energize the human body.

00:50:09.437 --> 00:50:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And let's assume they
were there en masse--

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:17.440 align:middle line:84%
300 people in a circle at one
time, getting this energy force

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.970 align:middle line:90%
hit at them.

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:20.320 align:middle line:90%
It could happen.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Maybe that's what
motivated the workers to go

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:26.410 align:middle line:84%
to such great efforts to
work with such heavy stones--

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:30.490 align:middle line:84%
that if the technology failed
and auditive levitation came

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:33.052 align:middle line:84%
down on them, they
felt like maybe

00:50:33.052 --> 00:50:34.510 align:middle line:84%
they were working
on something that

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:36.003 align:middle line:90%
had far greater importance.

00:50:36.003 --> 00:50:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you feel
energized when you were there,

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:40.193 align:middle line:90%
or did you feel tired and weak?

00:50:40.193 --> 00:50:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No, actually.

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:45.230 align:middle line:84%
We were doing group meditations
with Nassim Haramein

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and the 150 people
that were there

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.670 align:middle line:90%
with the Resonance Foundation.

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:52.090 align:middle line:84%
They gave us all these
art crystals to wear.

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:53.570 align:middle line:10%
I was participating.

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:54.760 align:middle line:90%
I was doing the om-ing.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And it did seem to
energize us and make

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.100 align:middle line:84%
us feel a little bit
better, especially

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.800 align:middle line:84%
in some of these
locations surrounded

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:07.360 align:middle line:84%
by these megalithic blocks
and architectural style.

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could feel that
vibrating in your system.

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:10.527 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's right.

00:51:10.527 --> 00:51:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And with the blocks
around it, there

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:15.515 align:middle line:84%
were even some niches
in Ollantaytambo

00:51:15.515 --> 00:51:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that you could put
your head in, and we

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.380 align:middle line:90%
all om-ed at the same time.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.140 align:middle line:90%
There are 12 of them in a row.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And you could feel the resonance
of all the other people doing

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.130 align:middle line:90%
it at the same time.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was just this
deep resonance sound,

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:32.230 align:middle line:84%
which the people of India
say that the om sound is

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:33.335 align:middle line:90%
the sound of the universe.

00:51:33.335 --> 00:51:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Would you go back again?

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, you bet.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.562 align:middle line:90%
Love to go.

00:51:37.562 --> 00:51:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you, Brad?

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:42.850 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Oh, you can
find me on bradolsen.com

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:43.830 align:middle line:10%
or CCC Publishing.

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:45.372 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Spell your
last name for us.

00:51:45.372 --> 00:51:46.678 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: B-R-A-D, O-L-S-E-N.

00:51:46.678 --> 00:51:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And since
you've been doing this--

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:49.920 align:middle line:90%
which is how many years now?

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: 25.

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you
categorize this region

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.720 align:middle line:84%
based on all the other
places you've been?

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.070 align:middle line:90%
And you've been to a lot.

00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:59.320 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: I have been all
seven continents now, George.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.670 align:middle line:10%
And I would say it's definitely
up there with the Angkor

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:07.600 align:middle line:10%
Wats of the world, the Great
Pyramid and Egyptian sites,

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.300 align:middle line:10%
and the Incan sites are my top
three favorite in the world.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief".

00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Always a
pleasure with you, George.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me on.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:18.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is fascinating
just to try to figure out,

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:23.890 align:middle line:10%
how did these structures get
built thousands of years ago?

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:26.260 align:middle line:10%
It defies our imagination.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:29.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
