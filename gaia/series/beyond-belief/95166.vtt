00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.928 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:11.919 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:13.460 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.432 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:19.265 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.265 --> 00:00:25.639 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we're going to
be talking about a disease that

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:10%
afflicts so many people in the
United States and worldwide.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a disease that most people
feel hopeless-- that they

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:84%
can't fix, that
they can't solve.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:90%
It's called cancer.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:90%
We call it the Big C.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
My special guest
on "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Ty Bollinger-- noted author,
"Cancer: Step Outside the Box."

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I want to say from the outset--
Ty is not a medical doctor.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:84%
He is not going to give
you medical advice.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:84%
But he's going to talk
about what happened to him,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and what experiences he had
in his own personal life

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
to begin to write about
and research cancer.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Ty, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TY BOLLINGER: George,
great to be here.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always a pleasure.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: Thank you.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.326 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How's life?

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:19.015 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: Life's good.

00:01:19.015 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:10%
Life's very good.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.232 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: CPA by trade, right?

00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Yes, I am.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I am-- masters in
taxation, as a matter of fact.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How in the
heck did you end up

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:84%
writing a bestselling
book on cancer,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
when you're a certified
public accountant?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Great question.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.790 align:middle line:84%
1996, July the 1st, my
father, Grand Bollinger,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:90%
was diagnosed with cancer.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:90%
He died on the 25th of July.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.716 align:middle line:84%
So in a period of 25
days, he was gone.

00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Raced through him.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.298 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: It
just destroyed him.

00:01:48.298 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And he actually-- the
surgery is what killed him.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.055 align:middle line:84%
They took this
whole stomach out,

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:84%
it was riddled with cancer's
tumors, and he bled to death.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And I began at that time,
to begin research treatments

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
for cancer-- natural
treatments for cancer.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Began to learn a lot about these
natural herbs and plants that--

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:84%
very effective at
treating cancer,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:84%
that are not all
that well known.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And over the course of
the next seven years,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.430 align:middle line:84%
after I lost my dad, I lost both
granddads, grandmother, uncle,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.754 align:middle line:90%
cousin, and finally my mother.

00:02:15.754 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cancer?

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: To cancer.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.261 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I'd been
researching for seven years,

00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I'd been compiling
information-- which

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.841 align:middle line:84%
is what I learned to
do in graduate school.

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:24.730 align:middle line:84%
The reason I mention
the masters in tax,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
if you can read through
the Internal Revenue Code,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.106 align:middle line:84%
and you can translate that
nonsense into a memorandum

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:84%
that people can understand,
I can do the same

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.750 align:middle line:90%
with medical literature.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I published
the book was after mom died,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.054 align:middle line:90%
a couple years.

00:02:36.054 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:84%
I had to get this
information out there,

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.229 align:middle line:84%
because I just
wanted to help people

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:84%
to have that knowledge as
they face the diagnosis.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I lost a family
member to cancer-- my sister,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:90%
she had stage four cancer.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.530 align:middle line:84%
They gave for six months
to-- she lasted two years.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
She didn't do
everything alternative.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
She did experimental
treatments, chemo, radiation,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
dabbled a little bit
I think with hemp oil.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
But she really didn't dive
into the alternative medicine.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I wish she would have, but it
was her family's decision--

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and her decision-- to try to
go the conventional route.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Stage four brain cancer is very
difficult to stop, improve.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: It is.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But much like
you, it's a subject

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that I've tried to investigate
all my career, because I've

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:84%
always been fascinated at
how a mutated cell can create

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
these cancer tumors, and
then faster within a body,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually
kill the person.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a simple melanoma,
or cancer of the liver,

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:84%
or like you said in your
case, stomach cancer

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:84%
with your relative-- what
is this thing called cancer?

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well, you
mentioned something

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
that's real important there,
you mentioned the spreading.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.905 align:middle line:84%
And I'll get to
that in a minute.

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:90%
But what is cancer?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is the body's
mechanism to wall off

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:90%
cells that have aberrant DNA.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Cancer cells are different
than normal cells.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Cancer cells ferment glucose
for energy, for instance,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:90%
normal cells are aerobic.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, cancer
cells feed on sugar.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Which is why we've always
heard-- if you have cancer,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:90%
get rid of sugar.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- it
feeds cancer cells.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:84%
But these cells, they
have different DNA.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:90%
They've changed DNA.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Whether it be from the exposure
to the environmental toxins--

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
which according to the American
Cancer Society website,

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.830 align:middle line:84%
about 90% to 95% of
cancers are caused

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.559 align:middle line:90%
by environmental toxicity.

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is that's
caused these cells

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:84%
to have aberrant DNA,
the tumor is really

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
the self mechanism of
the body to protect.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:90%
It walls off the cells.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
But what we do with
conventional treatments

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:90%
is we cut out the tumor.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Now what we have,
in essence, done

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.284 align:middle line:90%
is we have removed the symptom.

00:04:48.284 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
In essence, it's kind
of like the check engine

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:84%
light in your car-- it's
going off, it's flashing,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:90%
something's wrong with the car.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.661 align:middle line:90%
Do we smash it with a hammer?

00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't alleviate the problem.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:90%
But that's really what--

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Put in a brand
new engine, right?

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: We fix the engine,
we fix the problem, right?

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And then the light goes off.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's why conventional
treatments, while they do

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:84%
remove the tumors
a lot of times--

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's not that you need it.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Brain cancer, for
instance, with you sister.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.273 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it grew back.

00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:90%
They took it out, it grew back.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:90%
They took it out, it grew back.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: And
why did that happen?

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she said
after that, though,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:90%
after two operations-- I'm done.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:90%
No more.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Right,
and it happened

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't
fix the underlying

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
problem in the body
with the immune system,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.420 align:middle line:90%
and then the cancer grows back.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes removing
the symptom, the tumor,

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:90%
is essential.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a
fast-growing brain tumor,

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.311 align:middle line:84%
there's no place in the skull,
you've got to remove it.

00:05:37.311 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
But you need to
fix the underlying

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.656 align:middle line:90%
imbalance in the body.

00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that, the
cancer cells go away.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
The check engine light
goes off, because there's

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.293 align:middle line:84%
nothing wrong with
the engine anymore.

00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the cells float
within the bloodstream?

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Cancer cells do.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But a normally
functioning immune system

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:90%
is able to tag those cells.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
They target them, they
see something different,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:84%
they tag them and
they kill them.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They know
something's wrong.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: They know
something's wrong.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll wall it off
into a tumor, when there's

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.970 align:middle line:84%
too many to kill, they'll
wall it off in a tumor.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:84%
We biopsy the tumor to
see if it's cancerous.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:90%
What does that do?

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:84%
It seeds the cancer
into the bloodstream.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.557 align:middle line:84%
Not a very wise choice,
biopsies, in my opinion.

00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:90%
What would you do?

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Just leave it alone?

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: No, well
there's non-invasive tests.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Biopsies are tests,
mammograms are tests,

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:84%
PSA tests-- they're all
conventional tests for cancer.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.941 align:middle line:90%
All of them have their issues.

00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:24.981 align:middle line:84%
There are better tests
that are non-invasive that

00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:84%
don't cause the
spreading of the cancer,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
such as the AMAS
test-- anti-malignant

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:90%
antibody in serum.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Noninvasive blood
test-- you can measure

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:90%
the amount of anti-malignant.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:84%
You can do what's called
a Navarro urine test that

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:84%
measures the amount of HCG--
human chorionic gonadotropin--

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:90%
in the urine.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.176 align:middle line:90%
That's a cancer marker.

00:06:43.176 --> 00:06:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of tests that we

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.966 align:middle line:84%
can do that are non-invasive
that won't spread the cancer.

00:06:46.966 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it true that cancer
cells are in all our blood

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:90%
systems throughout?

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.245 align:middle line:84%
You have it, I have it,
everybody in this building

00:06:55.245 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:90%
has it.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Everyone in this
building, everyone that's

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:84%
watching in this TV
program, George, has cancer.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly creating
cancer cells every day.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a normal bodily process.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But again, back to the immune
system-- mutated cells,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:90%
it just happens.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.015 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:07:09.015 --> 00:07:10.390 align:middle line:84%
The immune system
that's working,

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
though, is able to target, tag
them, kill them, or wall them

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:90%
off in a tumor eventually.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.083 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
tumor that kills you,

00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
though, George--
it's the spreading

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:84%
of the cancer that
kills typically.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
But we're all creating
cancer cells every day.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.574 align:middle line:84%
If you're immune system's
working properly,

00:07:24.574 --> 00:07:26.740 align:middle line:84%
you won't be diagnosed with
life threatening cancer.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
I just finished

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:84%
a documentary miniseries
called "The Truth about Cancer:

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.100 align:middle line:84%
The Quest For the Cures,"
interviewed dozens

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
of medical doctors, and
every one of them to a T

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:84%
said, if you have a fully
functioning immune system,

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:90%
you can't have cancer.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that's
the big question--

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.180 align:middle line:84%
how do you get the immune
system up and running?

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Great question.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.182 align:middle line:90%
There are some basics.

00:07:49.182 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we're all being
exposed to environmental toxins

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.327 align:middle line:84%
that are compromising
the immune system.

00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Some of them we can't
do anything about-- we

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:84%
can't do anything about the
air we breathe, got to breathe,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:84%
can't really control
the quality of the air,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.513 align:middle line:84%
unless you want to move
to the mountain somewhere.

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:03.599 align:middle line:84%
Water we drink, we
do have control over.

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Try to minimize the
chemicals in the water,

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:84%
because fluoride and
chlorine are carcinogens.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
The food that we're eating--
we have control over that.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Pesticides on the food--
if it's not organic,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:90%
you have pesticides.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Pesticides are
xenoestrogens, they

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:84%
have an estrogenic
affect on the body.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
The body's estrogen
to testosterone ratio

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:84%
goes out of whack,
and you give rise

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:84%
to estrogen-sensitive
cancers, like breast cancer,

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.876 align:middle line:84%
cervical cancer, uterine,
prostate, testicular cancers.

00:08:28.876 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:90%
So we can control the food.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.454 align:middle line:84%
Watch out for genetically
modified organisms,

00:08:32.454 --> 00:08:33.490 align:middle line:90%
they do cause cancer.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So the way that you keep your
immune system functioning is

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.020 align:middle line:84%
to take control
over these things

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.460 align:middle line:84%
that we have been given control
over, and eat clean foods,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
drink clean water, exercise,
detoxify-- all these things

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
that we can do, that we know
in our mind that we should do,

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:90%
we need to actually do.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For years modern
medicine and big pharma

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:84%
have been trying to fight
cancer-- we think, right?

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.860 align:middle line:84%
They get millions of dollars,
maybe billions of dollars

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
in funding to try
to fight cancer.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Modern medicine and
pharmacies have yet

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to develop anything that could
completely eradicate cancer.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:90%
Do they not want to do it?

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my god, if
they've solved cancer,

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.664 align:middle line:84%
where's the next
dollar coming from?

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: More people are
making a living off of cancer

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:90%
today then are dying from it.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that quoted by
many researchers and doctors.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Do they really want
to cure cancer?

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Yes-- the people at
the bottom level, that

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.770 align:middle line:84%
are running for
the cure, they're

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:84%
working their tails
off to cure cancer.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:84%
The top dogs in the
pharmaceutical companies,

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:84%
in the American Cancer Society,
a lot of these non-profits,

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I think they're not all that
incentivized to cure cancer,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:84%
because they're making
a living off of it.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you talk about
the war against cancer

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:84%
over the past century,
we've seen much more

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:84%
of a war against natural
cancer treatments

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
than we have against
actually fighting cancer.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:84%
You look at Royal
Raymond Rife, you

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.910 align:middle line:84%
look a Harry Hoxsey, many other
doctors over the past 100 years

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:84%
have been persecuted,
run out of the country,

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
even imprisoned for
treating cancer naturally.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:84%
It almost seems like the
efforts, the funding,

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.514 align:middle line:84%
the manpower, has been focused
on attacking natural cancer

00:10:20.514 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:84%
treatments and
shutting them down,

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to really
finding a cure.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know the FDA
comes down on people who say,

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:90%
this cures cancer.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.870 align:middle line:90%
This does is this.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:84%
We know several people
they're going after right now

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:90%
who have said things like that.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:38.980 align:middle line:90%
How do you get around that?

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well, great
question-- let me be clear.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that I talk
about today, or nothing

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.010 align:middle line:84%
that I ever talk
about, cures cancer.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:84%
None of the supplements, none
of the foods, none of the herbs,

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:84%
none of the treatments,
they don't cure cancer.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:84%
What they do, the thing
that they have in common,

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
is that they will
target cancer cells--

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.972 align:middle line:84%
so they will kill some
of the cancer cells--

00:10:59.972 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they build
up the body's immunity.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.096 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: That's the key.

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:84%
They give your body
the fuel that it

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:84%
needs for the immune
system to run properly,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:90%
and your body cures cancer.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
The supplements don't,
the foods don't, none

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.890 align:middle line:90%
of these treatments cure cancer.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:84%
They give your body the
ammunition that it needs,

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:84%
where your body
fights the cancer,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.148 align:middle line:84%
and that's the way it
was intended to be.

00:11:19.148 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean my dad lived
to 88, he died because he fell.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have cancer.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:84%
I've got an uncle
in Boston, he's

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:90%
90-- he doesn't have cancer.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Yet my sister came
down with it--

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.829 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced she got
it on her cellphone,

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:37.620 align:middle line:84%
because it was right
on her left-hand side.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: We can
talk about that.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's
something going on there.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:46.901 align:middle line:84%
So some people are genetically
strong enough not to catch

00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
George Burns lived to
what, 100 years old?

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Smoked cigars.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
But other people are
predisposed to get cancer.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.565 align:middle line:90%
Why is the difference?

00:11:58.565 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: The difference,
as we go back to frequently,

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:90%
is the immune system.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.970 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at the American
Cancer Society's website right

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.386 align:middle line:10%
now, they've got
a document called

00:12:06.386 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:10%
"Cancer Facts and Figures 2013."

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.636 align:middle line:10%
On that document-- and
most of the most time

00:12:10.636 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:10%
you go to the doctor,
they say, your genetic.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.835 align:middle line:84%
It's genetic, you're going
to get cancer, it's genetic.

00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Well the ACS says only 5% of
cancers have a genetic trait.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:90%
95%--

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.943 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not a lot.

00:12:19.943 --> 00:12:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: It's
very, very small.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.740 align:middle line:84%
The huge percentage, the 95%,
is environmental toxicity.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So we look at the
immune system--

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:84%
some people may have a
more healthy and strong

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:84%
immune system naturally,
to where they can fight off

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
these toxins, where they
can smoke or drink to 100

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:90%
and not get cancer.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Where somebody like my father
that never smoked, never drank,

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.670 align:middle line:84%
didn't really do anything
aberrant-- not that that's

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.170 align:middle line:84%
aberrant-- but anything out of
the ordinary that would cause

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:90%
cancer, he died of cancer at 52.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.230 align:middle line:84%
All the more reason
for someone like

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:84%
me, that might have
that inherently weaker

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.400 align:middle line:84%
immune system, to be
very active at keeping

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:90%
my immune system strong.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you sometimes think,
oh boy, when I get close to 52,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:90%
look out?

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Is that in you?

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: It
was 15 years ago.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Right now cancer doesn't
scare me at all anymore,

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:84%
because I have the
knowledge to treat it.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I know how to treat almost
every different kind of cancer

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.670 align:middle line:90%
naturally.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, how to
fuel the body-- how

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.176 align:middle line:84%
to make the body work to get
rid of those cancer cells.

00:13:19.176 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle line:90%
I've learned the protocols.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:90%
I know the doctors.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.554 align:middle line:84%
I've included most
of them in the book.

00:13:23.554 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not afraid
of cancer anymore.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.790 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, 15 years ago,
that was one of the reasons

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:84%
that I started doing
detoxification, changing

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:84%
my diet, because I was scared
to death of getting to 52

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.784 align:middle line:90%
and catching cancer.

00:13:35.784 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't really catch it,
but I was afraid of that.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.116 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ty, why does it
seem that when they operate

00:13:40.116 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
on someone, when that
oxygen hits the system,

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.949 align:middle line:84%
cancer seems to spread
all over the place?

00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well, when
they operate on someone--

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They open you
up, and something happens.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.089 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: They
operate on someone

00:13:53.089 --> 00:13:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and they cut into
a cancerous tumor,

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.246 align:middle line:84%
cutting into a tumor seeds
the cancer into the blood.

00:13:59.246 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:84%
It causes the cancerous cells
to go into the bloodstream.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where it might
have been isolated.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well,
it was isolated--

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.310 align:middle line:84%
that's the body's
self-protection mechanism,

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:90%
is to wall it off into a tumor.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:09.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not spreading
at that point.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Most of the spreading
of cancer happens

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:84%
from either the diagnostic
treatments, or the treatments

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.412 align:middle line:84%
themselves-- like surgery--
to try to remove a tumor.

00:14:17.412 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:84%
There's no way if you remove
a tumor that you are not

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.490 align:middle line:84%
going to cut into that tumor
and spread some of those cancer

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:90%
cells into the bloodstream.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.827 align:middle line:84%
Then it goes through the
blood, into the lymph,

00:14:25.827 --> 00:14:26.660 align:middle line:90%
and it's everywhere.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about some
people who say, I had cancer,

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:90%
but now I'm cancer free?

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.679 align:middle line:10%
Can they justifiably say that?

00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: Well,
I guess they could

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.864 align:middle line:10%
say that I'm symptom free.

00:14:38.864 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
None of us are cancer free,
because as we mentioned,

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.405 align:middle line:84%
we're all producing
cancer cells.

00:14:42.405 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:90%
So we all have cancer.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of us at this
point still don't

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
have a life-threatening
diagnosis of cancer.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of us may not
have any symptoms

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:84%
of the cancer that's
in our bodies,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.440 align:middle line:84%
because the immune
system's doing its job.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.915 align:middle line:84%
And many people that have
been treated conventionally,

00:14:55.915 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
they're alive years later,
and they're cancer free.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And so people that have
been treated conventionally

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and are alive 10, 15 years
later, I'm so happy for them.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.430 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh, you
only want people

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.638 align:middle line:90%
to get treated alternatively.

00:15:06.638 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:84%
No, I want people
to have the freedom

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:84%
to do whatever they want in
the United States of America.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:90%
This is the land of the free.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.465 align:middle line:84%
You should have the option
to do this, or that,

00:15:13.465 --> 00:15:14.660 align:middle line:90%
it should be your choice.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
chemotherapy, radiation,

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.250 align:middle line:90%
and natural supplements.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Chemotherapy-- it's chemicals.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:90%
How does it not work?

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER:
Chemotherapy is a set

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.590 align:middle line:84%
of chemicals that targets
fast-dividing cells.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Cancer cells are
fast-dividing cells.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So does chemotherapy
kill cancer cells?

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Heck yeah.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And does it
kill everything else?

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.413 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: That's the problem.

00:15:40.413 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:84%
It kills the other fast-dividing
cells in your body.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Your hair follicles happen
to be fast-dividing.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:90%
That's why we lose our hair.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.500 align:middle line:84%
The intestinal lining in your
gut-- fast-dividing cells.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.471 align:middle line:84%
That's where you produce
your immune system.

00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why we get
sick and nauseated

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:90%
when taking chemotherapy.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:84%
The bone marrow where we
produce red blood cells,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:90%
fast-dividing cells.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So chemotherapy, while
it's killing the cancer,

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.870 align:middle line:84%
it's killing your immune system,
killing your bone marrow,

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:84%
killing your body's natural
ability to protect itself.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the problem
with chemotherapy,

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.170 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not selectively
toxic just to cancer cells.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And the most
expansive study that

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm familiar with that
was done on chemo,

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:84%
it was done at the Royal
City Cancer Center,

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Sydney, Australia, published
2004, National Institutes

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.625 align:middle line:90%
of Health, very reputable study.

00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Looked at 22 different
lines of cancer,

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:84%
over 20,000 cancer
patients, they

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.495 align:middle line:84%
determined that on a
five year survival rate--

00:16:30.495 --> 00:16:31.870 align:middle line:84%
which is how we
typically measure

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.799 align:middle line:84%
cancer success--
chemotherapy 2.1% effective.

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I talked to a researcher
from the City of Hope

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles, and she
specifically told me,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.040 align:middle line:90%
I hate chemotherapy.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But right now, this
is what we have.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.524 align:middle line:84%
But she truly admits it's
not the best treatment.

00:16:50.524 --> 00:16:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: It
doesn't work well.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.860 align:middle line:90%
It works well with some cancers.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:84%
It works well some lymphomas,
with some leukemias,

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.784 align:middle line:84%
works well with
testicular cancer.

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, so you've
got Lance Armstrong,

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.846 align:middle line:84%
he used conventional
treatments, testicular cancer,

00:17:02.846 --> 00:17:03.970 align:middle line:90%
it works for some of those.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:84%
But anytime that you have
an advanced cancer that

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.510 align:middle line:84%
has metastasized,
that it has spread,

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.470 align:middle line:90%
chemotherapy is useless.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When some
people like my sister

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:84%
develop stage four brain
cancer, obviously she

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
had stage one, two, and
three, and showed no symptoms,

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:90%
or was never diagnosed.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:84%
How long do you think it
took, Ty, from that stage one

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:35.945 align:middle line:84%
cancer that was in her head
to grow to that stage four.

00:17:35.945 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Good question.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.900 align:middle line:84%
It depends upon the kind
of cancer, and the person,

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
but as a general rule, when
you have a cancerous tumor that

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:84%
is diagnosed, and
it's stage four,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:84%
stage three, even--
life threatening--

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:84%
five years at least
it's been growing.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.626 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:17:50.626 --> 00:17:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: So I am I
am very much in favor

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.100 align:middle line:90%
of early detection.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
can get it early--

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: If you can get
it early, you can beat it.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Now the problem is the detection
methods like mammography

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.054 align:middle line:84%
for breast cancer, they
don't really detect early.

00:18:05.054 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Because by the time
that they detect it,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:90%
it's already a tumor.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.578 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's too late.

00:18:08.578 --> 00:18:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: It's
almost too late.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:90%
So you want early detection.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.090 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at
breast cancer-- thermography,

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
a woman goes in the doctor's
office, sits on a table,

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
they blow cool air
over the breasts,

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:90%
and they take a thermal image.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And the cancer cells are
more primitive cells,

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.355 align:middle line:84%
they don't react
as quickly, they

00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:28.330 align:middle line:84%
leave a hot spot, a red
spot on a thermal image.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:84%
This can detect breast
cancer five years,

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:84%
up to maybe sometimes
six, seven years,

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.670 align:middle line:90%
before a mammogram would.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:90%
That's true, early detection.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you prefer
that test for a woman.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I prefer
advanced thermography.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.980 align:middle line:84%
It can detect the
cancerous cells

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.744 align:middle line:84%
that are just beginning
to form the tumor,

00:18:42.744 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:84%
beginning to get their
own blood supply,

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that a mammogram
would not detect.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.639 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Radiation treatment,
how does that work?

00:18:48.639 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well,
you know radiation

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:90%
is a known carcinogen.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.909 align:middle line:84%
We know that radiation
causes cancer.

00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Look at the tens of thousands,
the hundreds thousands--

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.116 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they use
radiation to kill cancer,

00:18:58.116 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:90%
when we know it causes cancer.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: They use
chemotherapy to treat cancer,

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:90%
but it causes cancer.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a known carcinogen.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Radiation causes cancer, but
we use it to treat cancer.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, isolated cases,
like testicular cancer,

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
you can point that radiation
at a specific point that's

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:84%
not internal to the body,
like the testes in a man.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.560 align:middle line:84%
You can use radiation
and do pretty well.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a cancer
that's in the internal organs,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:84%
it's not selectively
poisonous to those organs.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.900 align:middle line:84%
You radiate
everything around it.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:84%
I've got one of my best
friends in college,

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:84%
his father was diagnosed
with advanced cancer.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
They gave him one
round radiation,

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:84%
he died within a month of the
radiation treatment, radiation

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.249 align:middle line:90%
poisoning.

00:19:35.249 --> 00:19:36.290 align:middle line:90%
The treatment killed him.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might he have
lived longer without it?

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: He would have
lived longer without it.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.999 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the problem--
radiation causes cancer.

00:19:41.999 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:84%
You look at Chernobyl, you look
at Fukushima, all the cancers

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
that have been
caused-- we know this,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
but we treat cancer with
a cancer-causing agent.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a disconnect.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand it-- but
that's the standard protocol.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.089 align:middle line:90%
The oncologists, I don't blame.

00:19:55.089 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:84%
They're doing the best they can
with what they've been given.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With what they know.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.171 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: But the
thing is, many of them

00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
know that it doesn't work,
because a study at McGill

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.805 align:middle line:84%
Cancer Center, in Montreal, they
surveyed oncologists and asked

00:20:05.805 --> 00:20:08.055 align:middle line:84%
them if they would take
chemo, if they were diagnosed.

00:20:08.055 --> 00:20:08.971 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And most say?

00:20:08.971 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Most,
over 90%, said no.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they said no.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Cancer: Step outside
the Box," tell me about this.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.032 align:middle line:90%
This is more natural, isn't it?

00:20:17.032 --> 00:20:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: This is a book
that not only deals with cancer

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:84%
treatments, but a large part
of it is in preventing cancer

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.830 align:middle line:90%
and how to be healthy naturally.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Because you want to
be proactive, and not

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.880 align:middle line:90%
reactive to cancer.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.452 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
have that diagnosis

00:20:30.452 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:84%
of a large tumor
in your intestines

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.852 align:middle line:84%
or your spleen or your
heart or your liver that

00:20:34.852 --> 00:20:36.310 align:middle line:84%
is going to kill
you in six months.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:84%
You want to be proactive
and prevent it.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:84%
What you do with
your cars is what

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:90%
we should do with your bodies.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:84%
You catch it before
the big problem arises.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.100 align:middle line:84%
An ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:84%
With cancer, I'd say
it's worth a ton of cure.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want to be
diagnosed with cancer.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And so you'd asked about
what's in the book,

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.010 align:middle line:90%
it's mostly a prevention book.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are a lot of natural
treatments that you can use,

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and I've sourced the
clinics and the doctors

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.370 align:middle line:84%
that you can contact, but
this is a book for everybody

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.160 align:middle line:84%
to stay healthy, because we
want to prevent cancer, not

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:90%
just reactively treat it.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.277 align:middle line:84%
We want to proactively
prevent it.

00:21:06.277 --> 00:21:07.901 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
missing the boat,

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:90%
I think, with modern treatments.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:84%
With this Run for the
Cure, October every year

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.430 align:middle line:90%
is Run for the Cure.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of good people
trying to Run for the Cure.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:84%
We should try to
run for the cause,

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:84%
or run for the prevention,
or so we don't need the cure.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So we give the body what
it needs, so we never

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:90%
have that diagnosis.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the ideal world.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
been told that cancer

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.610 align:middle line:90%
lives within an acidic body.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So what do we do to make
your body more alkaline?

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well,
probably the easiest step

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
that we can all take is
if you drink sodas, stop.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Because sodas or very acidic.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:84%
The pH, the potential
hydrogen of our body

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.020 align:middle line:84%
that measures the acid
versus alkaline balance,

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.297 align:middle line:84%
it's a logarithmic scale,
which means it's base 10.

00:21:49.297 --> 00:21:51.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you're mathematician what
that means is something that's

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:84%
a 7.0, on the pH scale,
versus something that's a 2.0,

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:84%
it's not five times more acidic
it's one with five zeros.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.160 align:middle line:90%
It's 100,000 times more acidic.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But cancer does
live in an acidic body.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Cancer
lives in an acidic body.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you're drinking
a lot of sodas,

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:84%
your body is
becoming very acidic,

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:90%
because the sodas are acidic.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Your blood's got to remain at
about a 7.3, or you're dead.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So then it begins to buffer
those acids with the minerals

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
from your cells, and then
your cells become acidic,

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's a breeding
ground for cancer.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Now you were talking
about starving cancer

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:90%
from glucose or sugar.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.200 align:middle line:90%
What does cancer do?

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.380 align:middle line:90%
Just thrive on sugar?

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.921 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Cancer
thrives on sugar,

00:22:31.921 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:84%
because these cells that have
mutated DNA, they have changed,

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.320 align:middle line:84%
they have pleomorphed into
cells that live on glucose.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.401 align:middle line:90%
They ferment sugar.

00:22:40.401 --> 00:22:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to get rid
of those cancer cells,

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.210 align:middle line:84%
get rid of their primary energy
requirement, which is sugar.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.066 align:middle line:84%
Quit eating processed,
refined sugar.

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying you
shouldn't eat fruits

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.220 align:middle line:90%
that have natural sugars.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Good thing to remember,
it's man-made, it's madness.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:90%
If it's God-made, it's good.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So if it's natural,
it's fine to eat.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.322 align:middle line:84%
But if it's been tweaked by
man, these processed sugars,

00:23:01.322 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
stay away, because that
feeds the cancer cells.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The white breads--

00:23:04.405 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: The white breads,
the starches, the white sugars,

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:84%
the white carbs, turn to sugar,
and it feeds your cancer cells.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you hate your
cancer, starve it.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How soon can
you start seeing change?

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.742 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I have
seen, not personally,

00:23:17.742 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
but I have seen people that
were diagnosed terminally

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.939 align:middle line:90%
see change within 30 days.

00:23:21.939 --> 00:23:23.980 align:middle line:84%
There was a man that I
interviewed on this latest

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Quest for the Cures,
his name's Chris Wark--

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:84%
he was diagnosed at
26, I think it was,

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:90%
with terminal colon cancer.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:84%
He went natural,
completely natural.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.168 align:middle line:84%
He said it just
didn't make sense--

00:23:34.168 --> 00:23:35.085 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No operation?

00:23:35.085 --> 00:23:37.126 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well, he did
have an operation first

00:23:37.126 --> 00:23:37.997 align:middle line:90%
to remove the tumor.

00:23:37.997 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But after that they wanted
to do chemo, radiation.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:84%
He said it didn't make sense
to him to poison his body

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.020 align:middle line:90%
to get his body well.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.561 align:middle line:84%
So he said, I'm not
going to do that.

00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:49.095 align:middle line:84%
He began to do juicing, organic
salads, just heavy nutrition.

00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:84%
He said, instead of overdosing
my body on chemicals,

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to overdose
on nutrition.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.483 align:middle line:84%
And he said, within I think
about a 60-day period,

00:23:55.483 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:84%
he saw a beginning reversal of
the cancer, and within a year

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.590 align:middle line:84%
or so-- before he was stage
three, terminal, and then

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:90%
within a year, he's cancer free.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:90%
And now it's 13 years later.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ty, what about
the body's ability

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:12.250 align:middle line:84%
to fight cancer just
by positive energy?

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Focusing energy that way?

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well, you
know, eight years ago,

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.210 align:middle line:84%
nine years ago when I
first published my book,

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.736 align:middle line:84%
I would've thought
that was crazy.

00:24:20.736 --> 00:24:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I thought that
had nothing to do.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:90%
But I've learned a lot.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:90%
We're constantly learning.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a good
supplement to this, isn't it?

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.146 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: It is.

00:24:27.146 --> 00:24:27.646 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:24:27.646 --> 00:24:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Positive thought, the
belief system-- look,

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:84%
when you're
stressed, when you're

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.145 align:middle line:84%
exhibiting fear and
stress, your body

00:24:35.145 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:84%
is secreting adrenaline,
cortisol, fight or fight

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:90%
adrenaline.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.140 align:middle line:84%
These hormones have
been shown to compromise

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.720 align:middle line:90%
the immune system.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.256 align:middle line:84%
When you're at peace,
when you're calm,

00:24:45.256 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:90%
when you laugh, OK?

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.554 align:middle line:84%
Laughter-- there was a
study that was done--

00:24:48.554 --> 00:24:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Greatest
medicine in the world.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Laughter
is the best medicine.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I think the Reader's Digest
used to have a column

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.636 align:middle line:84%
called Laughter's
the Best Medicine.

00:24:55.636 --> 00:24:57.010 align:middle line:84%
There were some
studies that were

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.593 align:middle line:84%
done within the last
couple years that

00:24:58.593 --> 00:25:00.980 align:middle line:84%
show that one minute
of laughter stimulates

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:90%
the immune system for 24 hours.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.135 align:middle line:84%
Now your average child
laughs 400 times a day.

00:25:07.135 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:90%
And by the time we become--

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHING]
There's one right there.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: That's
good for you.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:84%
By the time you're an
adult, only 40 times a day.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.857 align:middle line:84%
So we've cut our laughter down
to about what, one tenth--

00:25:15.857 --> 00:25:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had one
of those moments with a friend,

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:84%
a buddy, where you
started laughing,

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and you laughed so
hard it actually hurts?

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.090 align:middle line:90%
You can't stop.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Why does the body even laugh?

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
What is it about that complexity
that makes that happen?

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I think
that laughter is just

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:84%
a natural mechanism that's
been given to us by the creator

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:90%
to keep our bodies healthy.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:90%
It's exercise, too.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:84%
When you laugh hard,
you're actually

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.950 align:middle line:84%
toning the muscles
in your abdomen.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's in the
human system that does that?

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Is it the mind that
makes the laugh?

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.649 align:middle line:90%
Or something physical within us?

00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: I think it's both.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I think it's mental,
I think it's also--

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's healthy.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: It's very healthy.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:84%
It's mental, emotional,
it's physical--

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:90%
and it's a great release.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Because have you ever noticed
that when you've laughed hard,

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.520 align:middle line:84%
you've had a big
bout of laughter,

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:90%
you cry, are you stressed?

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:90%
No, stress is gone.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Tension's gone.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:90%
You are just--

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You take
that deep breath.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:12.556 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: You take a
deep breath, you're like,

00:26:12.556 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:90%
I just worked out.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like a natural
exercise session.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great feeling.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: It's
a great feeling.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.546 align:middle line:84%
Certain hormones
are released then

00:26:19.546 --> 00:26:21.390 align:middle line:84%
that are anti-cancer
when you laugh.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:90%
This has been shown empirically.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And on the flip side of the
coin, one minute of anger

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.074 align:middle line:84%
has been shown to suppress
immune function for six hours.

00:26:31.074 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So one more reason to
laugh instead of be mad.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What natural
supplements and techniques

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.080 align:middle line:90%
do you recommend?

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
We've talked on the radio
show about carnivora,

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.560 align:middle line:90%
an immune booster.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:84%
What else is out there
that will help people build

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:84%
that immune system, so
their body can take over?

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Sure,
great question.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.875 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in the
southern states where I live,

00:26:51.875 --> 00:26:53.375 align:middle line:84%
you can go outside
almost year round

00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and get free vitamins
with vitamin D. Vitamin

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.614 align:middle line:84%
D from ultraviolet rays from
the sun, very important.

00:26:59.614 --> 00:27:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Mixes with the
cholesterol in your skin.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I take a D supplement.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Take a
D supplement, too.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good old doctor told
me a couple years, he says,

00:27:05.905 --> 00:27:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Georgie, your D levels
are a little low.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.197 align:middle line:90%
I want you to raise those.

00:27:09.197 --> 00:27:09.780 align:middle line:90%
So I've been--

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.863 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Great advice.

00:27:10.863 --> 00:27:15.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, Creighton University
study from 2009, 77% of cancers

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:10%
can be mitigated with
proper vitamin D. Very,

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.320 align:middle line:10%
very important to take vitamin
D. Because most people,

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.907 align:middle line:10%
especially in the northern part
of the United States, Canada,

00:27:23.907 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:10%
all over the world, if you're
not getting much sunlight,

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.462 align:middle line:10%
you're probably
low in vitamin D.

00:27:28.462 --> 00:27:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Carnivore, we've
already mentioned.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Great immunomodulating agent.

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So you want your immune
system to be modulated--

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.271 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to rev it up,
you don't want it down regulate.

00:27:36.271 --> 00:27:38.750 align:middle line:84%
You want it nice and even,
like an engine of a car.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.208 align:middle line:84%
You don't want it
revving too high,

00:27:40.208 --> 00:27:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
the carnivora does.

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Another great modulator
for the immune system

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.060 align:middle line:90%
is beta-1 3D glucan.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:46.949 align:middle line:90%
Great modulator.

00:27:46.949 --> 00:27:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck is that?

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: It's an
extract from brown rice.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they get the
glucans from mushrooms.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, some medicinal
mushrooms have beta glucan,

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.470 align:middle line:90%
and they extract it.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I take it every day, my
wife and kids do, as well.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.481 align:middle line:84%
Selenium, very important
in cancer prevention.

00:28:04.481 --> 00:28:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Food-based selenium,
there have been

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.190 align:middle line:84%
studies that show an inverse
relationship in the countries

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:84%
that have high
selenium, low cancers.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.912 align:middle line:90%
Low selenium, high cancer rates.

00:28:13.912 --> 00:28:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm a
booster of turmeric.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:90%
I think the curry within it.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Huge
effect on cancer cells.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Very anti-cancer.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.605 align:middle line:84%
And that's why many of
the auravedic formulas,

00:28:24.605 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:84%
the auravedic medicine,
they all contain turmeric.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And they all contain
black pepper, too.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the black pepper,
causes it actually

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.105 align:middle line:84%
causes your body to be able
to absorb the nutrition that's

00:28:35.105 --> 00:28:36.130 align:middle line:90%
in these other herbs.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.099 align:middle line:84%
So that's why all the
auravedic recipes,

00:28:38.099 --> 00:28:40.140 align:middle line:84%
if you notice, they all
include the black pepper,

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
because it causes your body
to absorb the other herbs.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But turmeric, very important
in fighting cancer.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did the
ancients know this,

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and we somehow
lost it over time?

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Good question.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I think they knew it, because
we have innate wisdom.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.470 align:middle line:90%
And man, we're very smart.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.046 align:middle line:84%
And they were smart 2,000,
3,000, 5,000 years ago, too.

00:29:00.046 --> 00:29:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
we've become smart.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.810 align:middle line:90%
They were very smart then.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:84%
The problem today is that
we have been miseducated

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:84%
in the field of
medicine-- specifically

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.810 align:middle line:84%
degenerative
diseases like cancer.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was telling some
folks out in the lobby

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.450 align:middle line:84%
before the show
that I'm not talking

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.119 align:middle line:90%
about all medicine in general.

00:29:17.119 --> 00:29:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
put a broad scope--

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:84%
like, trauma
medicine, we're great.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Somebody hacks my arm off,
we go to the emergency room.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.613 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
mainstream medicine--

00:29:23.613 --> 00:29:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and I want everybody to
know this-- is phenomenal.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:90%
They do a great job.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:29.725 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Me, too.

00:29:29.725 --> 00:29:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Especially with trauma,
with these surgeries where

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.410 align:middle line:84%
they can replace people's eyes,
and they sew back on limbs,

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and they work with these
veterans that come over

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.743 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing these amazing
surgeries on their legs.

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking specifically in the
area of treating cancer, here,

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.519 align:middle line:84%
that the treatments are
really in the Dark Ages.

00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:45.560 align:middle line:90%
They're not working well.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not indicting the whole
medical system, by any means.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.474 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
would an oncologist

00:29:49.474 --> 00:29:53.150 align:middle line:84%
say to you after
they read this book?

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I've had
responses all over the board.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I've had oncologists tell me
that I am a conspiracy theorist

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.420 align:middle line:84%
quack that is killing
cancer patients.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've also been
contacted by at least three,

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.000 align:middle line:84%
four dozen-- maybe
more-- oncologists

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.107 align:middle line:84%
over the past few
years, asking me

00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:11.190 align:middle line:84%
what they should do because
they or their family's

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:12.100 align:middle line:90%
been diagnosed with cancer.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Killing
cancer patients?

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I've
been accused of that.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not once
have I heard you say,

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:16.570 align:middle line:90%
don't go see your doctor.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Never said that.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not once.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Never said that.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.080 align:middle line:84%
But many oncologists have
contacted me and asked me

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.030 align:middle line:84%
what they should do for
cancer, because they realize

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.620 align:middle line:84%
that the conventional
treatments aren't working,

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and I've actually consulted
oncologists-- as weird

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.389 align:middle line:84%
as that sounds--
in treating cancer

00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:32.430 align:middle line:90%
for them or their family.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.052 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you?

00:30:34.052 --> 00:30:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I want
to help people.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.470 align:middle line:90%
My family suffered.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.840 align:middle line:84%
There's no one that should lose
their whole family to cancer.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.950 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was 35, I was
basically the oldest person

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:45.810 align:middle line:84%
in my family, except
for one grandmother.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.514 align:middle line:90%
I lost everyone else to cancer.

00:30:47.514 --> 00:30:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And people should not
have to go through that.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:51.322 align:middle line:84%
My kids should not
have to go through life

00:30:51.322 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:84%
without knowing
their grandparents.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.800 align:middle line:90%
And so we've suffered.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I want other families
not to have to suffer like that.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.892 align:middle line:84%
I want to give them
the knowledge where

00:30:59.892 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:84%
they can make an
informed decision,

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.349 align:middle line:84%
and treat their cancer
the way that they should.

00:31:03.349 --> 00:31:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If cancer had
a brain, they probably

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:84%
would see you coming
going, oh no, not him.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.570 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: You know, I just
hope that through the DVDs,

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.107 align:middle line:10%
the books, through all the
speaking and then the research

00:31:15.107 --> 00:31:16.940 align:middle line:10%
that I've done that I'm
able to help people.

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.750 align:middle line:90%
That's all that I care about.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.791 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ty, if people
want to get a hold of you,

00:31:19.791 --> 00:31:21.427 align:middle line:84%
track you, what
do you recommend?

00:31:21.427 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:90%
What's your website?

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.450 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: Best place to
get me is www.cancertruth.net.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:30.437 align:middle line:84%
And with that, your book,
everything else, your DVDs--

00:31:30.437 --> 00:31:32.645 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: It's all linked
through on that website.

00:31:32.645 --> 00:31:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well thanks
for helping people.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.290 align:middle line:90%
I think that's so important.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.748 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Thank you, George,
for giving me the platform.

00:31:37.748 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ty Bollinger
on "Beyond Belief."

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.980 align:middle line:10%
He fights cancer.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.320 align:middle line:10%
"Cancer: Step outside the Box."
