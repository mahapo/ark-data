>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, we
love our psychics here

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:90%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:10%
And we've got a doozy for you--

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:10%
Mark Christopher
Nelson, a psychic medium

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:10%
with clairvoyant, clairaudient,
clairsentient abilities.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
He hears and sees messages
from friends and family

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
who have crossed over
to the other side.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, their messages
can provide information

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:84%
about our relationships,
our careers, personal growth

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and can help us make
better decisions,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:84%
achieve goals, and find
greater happiness in our lives.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Mark, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK CHRISTOPHER
NELSON: Hey, George.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.330 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.740 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be fun.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm looking
forward to this.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
I've heard great
things about you.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
How did this ability happen?

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: Well, it started out.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:10%
I didn't plan on being
a psychic medium.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:10%
I was busy being a writer
and working in advertising.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:10%
But it actually goes
back to when I was a kid.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I had a family tragedy
where my father was

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:90%
killed when I was 11 years old.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, gosh.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: And so he went to
work one day, didn't come home.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:10%
And then shortly after
that, I saw him standing out

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:10%
front of our house.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:90%
I was out raking leaves.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:84%
We were living on
the East Coast.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.383 align:middle line:84%
And I was just trying to be
a normal kid trying to do--

00:01:30.383 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Normal
kid things, right?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:90%
And then I saw him.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, all right,
I'm losing my mind.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was raised Catholic.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not used to dealing
with this kind of thing.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm used to the priest just
standing up, do the whole--

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:90%
and I just doing--

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and so I didn't know
what to make of it.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was in my own little mind
thinking, am I losing my mind?

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw him
again at my school.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But there wasn't anything
threatening about it.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.067 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't anything.

00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
He just wanted to say,
hello, I love you.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK, because of the--

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He didn't have
that closure, did he?

00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: He went to
work like any other day.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I learned that,
OK, pay attention

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:84%
when people come
and go in your life.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And so as an adult, I'm
taking care of business.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
We lived in St. Louis,
actually, at the time.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
I wish my dad

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
could have met my wife, our
daughter, saw the house.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like, dad, look
life is going on.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And he came through
and said, I am.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:90%
I have met them.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:90%
I have seen them.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm thinking,
all right, I'm

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
having a benign
schizophrenic experience.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Because this is outside
of what I'm used to.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: But then I started
to get other messages.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And I started to bounce
them off my mom, who I'd

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:90%
say, hey, I heard this about--

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:90%
I had a dream.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I always catch it-- "had
a dream" about my brother

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Glen, my brother Steve.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did she--

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: She'd
say that was right.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.650 align:middle line:90%
How did you know?

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Did you talk to them?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, they're
back in California.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't really talked to them.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to go into
a psychic bookstore

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:90%
where I wouldn't know anybody.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like I wanted
to do my own cold test.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:90%
And I read for the manager.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said it feels
like your son just

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:90%
got beat up really badly.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.452 align:middle line:90%
He's convalescing at home.

00:03:10.452 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And your dad is
taking care of him.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:90%
He says yes.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
start reading for us?

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And it went bang,
just like that.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And then I started
to read out of a shop, then

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:90%
I read out of another shop.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we ended up moving back
to Los Angeles for my wife's

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Someone put in my name
for this TV production,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:90%
had a cattle call.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:90%
I went in.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I was one of 200 psychic
mediums, ended up

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.575 align:middle line:90%
being one of six on the show.

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up winning
the competition.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, you
did, as you said.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Psychic medium Laura Lee,
of course, talks about some

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:90%
of these abilities, too.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:10%
>> When this happened, and
you were a little girl,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:10%
and you started, did
you see dead people?

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.570 align:middle line:10%
Or did you feel
them or hear them?

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Just about all.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:10%
They would come to me,
typically in the evening

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:10%
hours that were at night.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:10%
>> In your room?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, receptive.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.325 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, scared,
scared of the dark.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Not through
the closet, right?

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Not through the closet--

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:10%
very frightened of the dark.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:10%
So anybody who is out
there has children

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:10%
who are scared of the
dark, don't discount it

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:10%
and especially if they
see deceased loved ones.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:10%
That's typical of children.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:10%
But for some reason, I
never grew out of it.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:10%
And my parents
didn't dismiss it.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:10%
I think that's key.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:10%
>> That is important.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.057 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that's key.

00:04:28.057 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Because a lot of parents
think that this is a kid

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:10%
playing a little kid
game or something.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:10%
And they try to
talk them out of it.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:10%
Yours did not.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:10%
>> No, no.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:10%
Curious.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:10%
And I think a lot of
people in my family

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:10%
have had the experience.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:10%
And I think a lot
of families do.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I'm
here to talk about.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:10%
I think a lot of people
have these experiences,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.950 align:middle line:10%
but they don't want to become--

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:10%
they don't want to be
seen as weird or crazy.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:10%
So they keep it under
the covers like I did.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:10%
I kept it under the covers
for many years, literally.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:10%
I would sleep at night with
the blankets up over my head

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:10%
and have a portal, so
I could breathe, just

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:10%
to keep them out of my
sphere, so I could just sleep.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating, Mark, how
it happens when you're a kid--

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --these
experiences just like you.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, like I
said, I totally understand

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and can relate very much
to what she was saying.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Because I see little movies.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:90%
They show up.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And also, too, I
think that depending

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.973 align:middle line:84%
on the spirit that's
trying to come through,

00:05:27.973 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:90%
they'll use what you have.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
George, you have a
wonderful speaking voice.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:84%
You have great facilities
for communication.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:90%
They may want to talk to you.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
They'll use whatever
skills you have.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:90%
They use the skills I have.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
very astute when

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:90%
it comes to that, aren't they?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, I think
that they try to--

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
again, they'll use
what's available to them

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:84%
to try to reach
us and talk to us.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You love helping
other people, don't you?

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I didn't, I would
be in the wrong business.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
things she talked about

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle line:90%
was that going to help kids.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I started doing
paranormal investigating.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And it came from someone
saying our kids won't sleep in

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.230 align:middle line:84%
their rooms anymore,
because they saw a man walk

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.570 align:middle line:90%
through the wall in their room.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up going and
finding out that, all right,

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm hearing the name Wilson.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:90%
There's a guy named Wilson.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Oh, our neighbor, Mr.
Wilson, just died.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.975 align:middle line:90%
And so that made--

00:06:26.975 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're not
prompted or anything.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: No.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It just comes to you.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: You know what?

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.605 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like, George,
you get lots of ideas.

00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:34.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.880 align:middle line:90%
This seems like a good idea.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:84%
For me, I'll hear something
that sounds like someone

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:90%
is whispering in my ear almost.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And it just pops
into my thought.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned not to
discard it or discredit it.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.275 align:middle line:90%
And I'll just go with it.

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you still
communicate with your father?

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yes, on
a regular basis.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:90%
And he'll tell me.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I feel like he
was coaching me today.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:90%
Hey, relax.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Go have fun.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And this would be a nice thing.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it is.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.558 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes, I agree.

00:07:02.558 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Do you need to communicate
with your father still?

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe he needs with you.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.473 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Oh, I think
that I need him,

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:90%
maybe more than he needs me.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:90%
I think he's there.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you lose a
mom or you lose a dad,

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.230 align:middle line:84%
they don't stop
caring about you.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:90%
You lose a sister.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Whoever it is, a family member--

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
they don't stop just
because they're not

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.107 align:middle line:90%
here in the physical.

00:07:26.107 --> 00:07:27.190 align:middle line:90%
They want to be available.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That love is forever.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Completely.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And this past week, I've
dealt with people who have

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:90%
lost a child, lost a sister.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- and then
they know that when

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:84%
we're going through things, they
seem to be very conscious of it

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and want to be
present to help us.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, when they
talk about crossing over,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean, actually?

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well,
it means the idea

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen
it in the movies.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:84%
We've seen things like that
where people are like a spirit,

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:90%
a person is earthbound.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But then they're not really
in the place they should be.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
of the other side

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:90%
is you want to call it heaven.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:90%
I see it as the white light.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be
something that applies,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:84%
regardless of your
religious belief.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:84%
For me, it means going
home, essentially.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest people who
investigates life after death

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.940 align:middle line:90%
stories is Dr. Raymond Moody.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.919 align:middle line:10%
>> I saw my deceased grandmother
as vividly as I have seen any

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:10%
other person.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:10%
I felt her presence.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.529 align:middle line:90%
I heard her voice.

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:10%
And to this day, I'm
still startled by that.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I can't
deny my experience.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:10%
It was completely real to me.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.350 align:middle line:10%
When people have an
apparition of the deceased,

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:10%
one of the things that
they often describe

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:10%
is how natural it seems.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:10%
I think if you're just
sitting abstractly and saying

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:10%
that Aunt Ruth had a
visit from Aunt Jane

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:10%
last night, that you would think
that that must be something

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:10%
totally extraordinary and
out of the order of anything

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:10%
we experience.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:10%
But what people say is, no,
this is completely natural.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:10%
The naturalness of it is one
thing that people experience.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.950 align:middle line:10%
And I can talk about that
from my own experience,

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:36.220 align:middle line:10%
that I realized full well
that my grandmother was dead.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:10%
And I guess I could
have abstractly realized

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:10%
that there is something very
paradoxical in that situation.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:10%
But in terms of the encounter
that I had with my grandmother,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:10%
it was completely natural.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:10%
Because, number one, it was
like all her neuroses were gone.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:10%
It's like she acknowledged
them in some way

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:10%
that that's how I used to be
with a little bit of humor

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:10%
in her eyes, but
also that that's

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:10%
something she left behind.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:10%
And so it was just--

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:10%
I was talking with my
grandmother, and she was dead.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.100 align:middle line:10%
And I was completely awake.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:10%
And another very
odd thing about it

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:10%
was that when I
looked at her, she

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:10%
looked like just
a physical person,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:10%
except that there was a
light just around her, not

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:10%
like a light that I
would experience here,

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:10%
but is very vibrant
in energy emanation,

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:10%
and that in the way that I
can't describe very well,

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:10%
it was like she was
indented, right?

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:10%
That she was pushed back
from the physical framework

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:10%
in a way, and that that's what I
was seeing is this energy line.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He means so much to
this research, doesn't he?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.223 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's one of the giants.

00:11:12.223 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And I love what he
was saying about how people,

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.333 align:middle line:84%
even though they may cross over,
that they still retain that

00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:84%
certain something that you could
recognize as someone you love--

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: --and felt for.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you could feel
their love for you still.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is that glow
that he was talking about?

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I believe
that, George,

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
this chair I'm sitting
on is really energy,

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.920 align:middle line:90%
that we are energy.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Quantum mechanics tells us
that everything comes down

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:90%
to a level--

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's emitting--

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: --of energy.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --something, isn't it?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And so in my experience, spirit,
whether you know them or love

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:84%
them, or you read or bump into
them in another environment,

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.543 align:middle line:84%
they're using energy to
make themselves known to us.

00:11:53.543 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who do you
help the most, Mark,

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
the human who wants to
communicate with the other side

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:84%
or those on the other side
who need to cross over?

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: I think I help both.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Both?

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And the reason is
that I get my information

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:90%
from people on the other side.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And they are usually
in a great place

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:84%
where they want to
communicate to their--

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
this past week, I spoke to a
woman who had her daughter.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:90%
She had taken her own life.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.885 align:middle line:84%
And it put the
mother in a great--

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:23.121 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, God.

00:12:23.121 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Horrible.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: --terrible place.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But this woman in
spirit, this young woman

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:90%
was trying to tell mom, I'm OK.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:90%
I made a mistake.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.833 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doesn't justify it.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: No, no, no.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:84%
But this woman was going
through such great pain.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the spirit wanted

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to help alleviate
her mother's pain.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Because also, too, and
what the doctor was saying

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:84%
is that many of the things that
are quirks and are problems--

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that is based on the
physical, the body.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not our soul.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not our consciousness
so that when we step away

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.950 align:middle line:84%
from this physical
being, we tend

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:84%
to be a little clearer, more
together version of ourselves.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:84%
We don't stop being
who we were, but we

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
have less of the physical
foibles that have maybe played

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:90%
us or bothered us in our lives.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember the
movie "Poltergeist," Mark?

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Oh, of course.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
The little psychic medium would
be yelling, go into the light!

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Go into light!

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Then said, don't
go into the light.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was confused about
that when I saw that.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well,
sometimes people think

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.120 align:middle line:84%
if you have an NDE, a
near-death experience,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:84%
you might be tempted
to go towards it,

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:90%
but it may not be your time.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I have actually
helped cross spirits

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.595 align:middle line:90%
over that are wanting to leave.

00:13:42.595 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you go into the
light, have you crossed over?

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:90%
And can you come back?

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: I don't think so.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't want to--

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good to know that.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Once you go, I think
it's a one-way thing.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a one-way trip.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.777 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: But you can also--

00:13:56.777 --> 00:13:59.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- and we've all
heard conversations.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.635 align:middle line:84%
I've known friends who have had
near-death experiences where

00:14:02.635 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:90%
they're on that edge.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.802 align:middle line:90%
And they're going, should I go?

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Should I stay?

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually
someone that will say,

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:90%
your work here is not done.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:90%
You have more to do.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to-- don't
go into the light yet.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:84%
When you're ready,
you'll have that chance.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the light?

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: The light to me is--

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to call it--

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from my Christian
perspective background,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:90%
it's heaven.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It's where we can meet
our loved ones again.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.348 align:middle line:90%
It's this whole other side.

00:14:33.348 --> 00:14:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.517 align:middle line:84%
And what about the
hell side of this?

00:14:36.517 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: All right.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:90%
I believe that there is hell.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:10%
I've been in places where
bad things have occurred.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:10%
And it's almost like it's a--

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:10%
you can feel this negative
energy in the air.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that there
are demonic presences.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:84%
I haven't dealt with
demonic spirits.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I have dealt with
malevolent spirits.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's occurred in going
into investigations where

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:04.470 align:middle line:84%
murders have taken place, where
bad things have occurred, where

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:90%
spirits can oppress people.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.470 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
difference between

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:90%
the demonic and malevolent.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And I don't look forward
to dealing with it,

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.860 align:middle line:84%
but I always try to
remember that I'm not

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:90%
going in there alone.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I always go in with the
idea that I've got friends

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
on the other side who
are helping me, and God,

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.490 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been psychically attacked?

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that like?

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: You know what?

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like we went to this
place where a serial killer had

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:90%
gone into a home.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.428 align:middle line:90%
And we had it validated.

00:15:36.428 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:90%
But I went in afterwards.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very clear vision
of who I was dealing with.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I went home with--
my wife goes with me--

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.033 align:middle line:90%
Barbara.

00:15:45.033 --> 00:15:45.833 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Barb.

00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:47.422 align:middle line:90%
And we went out.

00:15:47.422 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gutsy person, right?

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes, she is.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:50.770 align:middle line:90%
She stood by my side.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.087 align:middle line:90%
We went into this place.

00:15:52.087 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And we had been
married over 30 years.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:84%
We came home and got
into the worst argument

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:90%
like a screamer--

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: --that was like--

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
unusual for you two?

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: We had two of
those, but one of them--

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.928 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally
leave this place.

00:16:03.928 --> 00:16:05.512 align:middle line:84%
And then we both go,
well, whoa, whoa.

00:16:05.512 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Wait, wait, wait.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:90%
This is not normal.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't normally deal
with our issues this way.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt, OK,
this is oppression.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:90%
This is a psychic attack.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:90%
I felt like this guy had--

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.513 align:middle line:84%
it was a spirit connected
to the Black Dahlia murders.

00:16:24.513 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out of Los Angeles?

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yes, in the Los
Angeles-- we went to a home

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:84%
where the producers
of this one show said,

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:84%
we think something
happened here.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, all right.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.150 align:middle line:84%
If a doctor lived in this house
at the time of the murder,

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.060 align:middle line:90%
he was the one.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:90%
He's here.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me this
and this and this.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.442 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite
shocking, though.

00:16:41.442 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And then Barbara didn't want
to go back to the house.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Because for the production,
they wanted me to go back again.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:46.986 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very negative.

00:16:46.986 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: But it clearly--

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:48.928 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very negative.

00:16:48.928 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: It was like,
all right, it really

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:84%
woke me up to-- they can cause
you to think and act in ways

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.442 align:middle line:90%
that are not normal for you.

00:16:56.442 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, what
is psychometry?

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Psychometry
is the ability

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to read the energy connected
to an object, a thing, a place.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
you, again, believe

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:84%
that quantum mechanics
says, we're all energy,

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.299 align:middle line:90%
you radiate energy.

00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:11.099 align:middle line:90%
I see you.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:90%
You're wearing a nice suit.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.200 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to take
aura photography of you,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:84%
we would see a little
glow coming off of you.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:84%
That energy of yours
imprints on your watch,

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
your tie, everything
that you touch.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm able
to pick up an object,

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm normally able
to hear something

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.948 align:middle line:90%
about the person who owns it.

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:30.748 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like--

00:17:30.748 --> 00:17:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that work?

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Think of
it as psychic DNA.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like you leave
a little bit of--

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:90%
go to a crime scene.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And they have--
they leave your DNA.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, that energy that
we all exude that we all

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.480 align:middle line:84%
are made up, that we
leave a little bit

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:90%
of a residual energy.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why I think
it explains hauntings.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I think that explains
why there are objects

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:90%
that seem to be haunted.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we've heard that.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.920 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's possible.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we leave a
little bit of our psychic DNA,

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
our energy on the things that
we wear, touch, and hold.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.678 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you touch my watch,
will you pick up something?

00:18:04.678 --> 00:18:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes, I think I would.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.137 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You want to try it?

00:18:07.137 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Sure, let's go for it.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You need to hold it?

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: I'd like to.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a heavy one.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Now, that's a watch.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.352 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is a watch.

00:18:14.352 --> 00:18:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: OK.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, one thing.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:84%
What I'm getting for you,
George, right now is--

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:90%
well, there's a couple things.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:84%
One, I feel that
business is going

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.230 align:middle line:84%
to take you to be negotiating
with some people out of New

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:84%
York, and that it's going
to also create this other--

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.182 align:middle line:90%
you're a busy guy.

00:18:35.182 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Everything I know about you--

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.627 align:middle line:90%
George is always in motion.

00:18:37.627 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.752 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: But I get this thing.

00:18:39.752 --> 00:18:42.592 align:middle line:84%
It's another venue
where people are

00:18:42.592 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:90%
going to want to talk to you.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.853 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's going
to be based in New York,

00:18:45.853 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
but I think you're dealing
with a New York based company--

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.152 align:middle line:90%
media entertainment.

00:18:49.152 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I'm getting,
too, is that I'm sitting here.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening to
water behind you.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So I've got to think that in
your house, back at your home,

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.993 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be either a
water issue, water leak, bricks,

00:19:02.993 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:84%
something where
you're going to be

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:84%
doing some work in
the back of your home.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:90%
And I know it's very mundane.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:90%
And what am I?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.958 align:middle line:90%
This old house psychic.

00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, I'll answer
you on some of these.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:90%
Keep going.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: OK, so
I feel that you're

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.560 align:middle line:84%
going to be needing
to dig up bricks,

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:84%
do some renovating in
the back of your home.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.278 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing you walking
around and looking

00:19:20.278 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:90%
at how this should be fixed.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to do this,
I'd like to do that.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So it feels like
you're going to be--

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.850 align:middle line:84%
it's a combination of fixing
and renovating, but revisioning

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.610 align:middle line:90%
the back of your house, OK?

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.745 align:middle line:90%
Also, too, we spoke about this.

00:19:34.745 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But I'm getting
it very strongly.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I feel that you've got all of
these people with the name G--

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.143 align:middle line:90%
beginning with the G behind you.

00:19:42.143 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I felt like that
before I sat down with you.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's just I'm
feeling it now.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:90%
They're saying love.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:84%
They're sending-- I feel like
you've got your team behind

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.770 align:middle line:90%
you, all the letter G--

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're the best.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:53.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --and
that they don't--

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:55.920 align:middle line:90%
they're very proud.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the other thing,
too, is I feel

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.108 align:middle line:84%
that your house is
going to be used

00:19:59.108 --> 00:20:00.703 align:middle line:90%
for either some big celebration.

00:20:00.703 --> 00:20:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's almost like
you want to prepare the house,

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:84%
get it ready for
a party, an event.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's all of this nice
things happening behind you

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:90%
in the house.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Does any of that make
any sense to you?

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:11.865 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
let me address it.

00:20:11.865 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle line:90%
In terms of the Gs, my family--

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:84%
mother, father, two sisters,
me-- we all start with a G. OK,

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.090 align:middle line:84%
it's Gabriel, Georgette,
George, Gayle, and Glenda.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:26.143 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've lost Gabriel and
Glenda, but we're all Gs.

00:20:26.143 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Were all Gs.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:27.890 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, in terms of
what's behind my house, just

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:84%
a few days ago, I was looking
at what's behind my house.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a built-in Jacuzzi
that I have not lifted

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.910 align:middle line:90%
the top of in three years.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And I need to have
a guy come out

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and clean it, service
it, and fix it.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:84%
But some of the
brick around it is

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:90%
beginning to sink and settle.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, oh, gosh,
I got to get that fixed.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
In terms of New
York, I am dealing

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
with a couple
television production

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
companies in Los Angeles,
based in New York that

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.110 align:middle line:84%
want to talk to me about
a couple more different TV

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: What I
would say, George,

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.230 align:middle line:84%
is you're going to get to
be even busier than you are.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm being
told to tell you.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like, be OK with
letting go of some things.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like
that you're going to--

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.950 align:middle line:84%
the priority is going to
shift to you doing something

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:90%
that you really want to do.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing you
doing more, maybe

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
a location thing.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.983 align:middle line:84%
I love what you do, because
you bring in so many

00:21:28.983 --> 00:21:30.150 align:middle line:90%
cool and interesting people.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: But you get to
go to some of these places,

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.620 align:middle line:90%
The other thing, too--

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you have
to spend time in Vegas.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.103 align:middle line:84%
If some of this takes you to
Vegas, don't be surprised.

00:21:39.103 --> 00:21:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Because that feels like it's
going to be taking you there.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing you
looking at objects.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It's almost there's
a museum quality.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Either there's a collection of
some of the work that you have,

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.360 align:middle line:84%
some of the
interesting artifacts.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Or it's going to
take you to where

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.410 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about them,
showing them, and explaining

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're
going to remind me

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
of a kid in a candy
store a little bit

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.422 align:middle line:84%
where this is getting to be
fun, where you get to play.

00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to be really--

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.245 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's got to be
fun, or I don't want to do it.

00:22:06.245 --> 00:22:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: That'll
be your option.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I got my watch back.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yeah, I usually tell
people, let me hold your watch.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.633 align:middle line:90%
I promise to return it.

00:22:12.633 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Sorry.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
were holding this,

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:90%
you were getting these feelings?

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: It's like
someone whispers in my ear.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.140 align:middle line:90%
And so it comes through.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's how it works for me.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you can
tell I'm a chatty guy.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And they just go,
boop, boop, boop.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does this work?

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can everybody feel
the same thing that you feel?

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- or do we have
to be sensitive to it?

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.520 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I think it's
a bit like singing.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like I have
a terrible voice,

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:84%
but with a little coaching,
I can sound not so bad.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.800 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.500 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
some people are just--

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:84%
they're born-- they show
up with amazing voices.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's a gift.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that no matter
where you are on the scale,

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:84%
that you may have a
little sensitivity if you

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:84%
pay attention to it
and you honor it.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's learning
how to quiet other things

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:06.970 align:middle line:90%
in your head.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the average person is,
I got to go take care of this.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:90%
I got to go here.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:90%
I got to show up.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.168 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: If you can
carve out a little--

00:23:13.168 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:84%
a few minutes where
you learn to just hear

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.473 align:middle line:84%
your own voice and/or hear, just
look, listen for just a quiet--

00:23:21.473 --> 00:23:22.390 align:middle line:90%
create a little quiet.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And I do that
through meditating.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And for me, meditating
is 5 minutes.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.560 align:middle line:90%
It's 10 minutes.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not three days
on a mountaintop.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.870 align:middle line:90%
It's 10-- I kid myself.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:90%
I call it a 7-minute vacation.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take a
7-minute vacation.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've dealt with some
pretty high-profile Hollywood

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:37.890 align:middle line:90%
investigations.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did that
all come about for you?

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.813 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, it
started out with the show

00:23:41.813 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:90%
where it's like I show up.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.340 align:middle line:90%
And they bring me into a place.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you, I feel
like my psychic ability

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.623 align:middle line:84%
is like a floor wax
and a dessert topping.

00:23:51.623 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I could read you.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:90%
I can hear this.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:54.940 align:middle line:90%
But they bring me to a place.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And I can start to
hear things there, too.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I was given
the opportunity

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:06.280 align:middle line:84%
to go to a landmark hotel
in Los Angeles, where they

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:90%
were doing a major renovation.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.055 align:middle line:90%
It's a five-star hotel.

00:24:10.055 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:84%
It had been closed
for two years.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well known?

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:13.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yeah,
I'm supposed to--

00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I can't really say the name,
because I signed an agreement.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I get it.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: But I went in
with the general manager

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.800 align:middle line:90%
and head of security.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:90%
They had literally had to--

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:84%
they were having
their tools unplugged,

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:90%
doors locked behind workmen.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And the workmen are just
dropping their stuff.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going in there.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're done with that.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.148 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: I'm not done.

00:24:31.148 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
There's something creepy,
bad going on here.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.990 align:middle line:90%
And so I went to this hotel.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to--

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll preface this.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.900 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go on the
blonde apparition tour.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
going to call it.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.313 align:middle line:84%
Because it turns out,
I go to this place.

00:24:45.313 --> 00:24:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And I say, all right,
there's a woman standing

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:48.430 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the stairs.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:84%
We were in one of the
coldest days of winter.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But I see her in a summery
white dress, and I'm thinking.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this looks
like Marilyn Monroe.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:90%
This is a very high end hotel.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, that was
Marilyn Monroe's bungalow.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:84%
She would spend a
lot of time there.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well she doesn't
want you to go in there.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And so we had to basically--

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I'll go in and say, Miss Monroe,
this hotel is being renovated.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And also, to the
people here, you

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.453 align:middle line:84%
need to respect
that she is here.

00:25:19.453 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But she
didn't die there.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:21.730 align:middle line:90%
She died in her house.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Oh, she
did not die there.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:23.920 align:middle line:90%
But it was a place--

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.600 align:middle line:84%
she would spend-- lived
there for months at a time.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know
where this place is.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And I won't say it either.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: It was a
very beautiful place.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And then so I helped them
get the spirits to calm

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:84%
down so that the tools
wouldn't be unplugged,

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.185 align:middle line:84%
so that literally
when we went up there,

00:25:41.185 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:84%
their electronic
locks didn't work.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:90%
I also had a chance to--

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
there's a guy who collects
unusual things, items

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.140 align:middle line:90%
of celebrities.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
a little dark.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But he gave me this little
piece of black leather.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.020 align:middle line:90%
And I held this leather.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately saw this
woman, 1960 vintage era,

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.430 align:middle line:84%
preening in a rearview mirror,
very blonde, very beautiful,

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:07.930 align:middle line:90%
doing her eyelashes.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out to be a
piece of leather from the car

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.780 align:middle line:90%
that Jayne Mansfield died in.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:90%
It was a little--

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --piece
of black leather.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was tragic.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And so she's
doing her eyelashes.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I have also had a
chance to go to the property.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.290 align:middle line:84%
It's actually adjacent, but
it's on the same street,

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:84%
very close where the
Manson-Tate murders took place.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cielo.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:32.977 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Cielo Drive.

00:26:32.977 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I've been up there
a number of times

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:90%
and had interesting experiences.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to get messages
that I could validate from Jay

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Sebring, one of the victims.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:90%
And it was really--

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.425 align:middle line:84%
they wanted us to know that
they are beautiful again.

00:26:48.425 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And it was a really--

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: They are
beautiful again.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to look at
psychic Marla Frees, who

00:26:53.105 --> 00:26:55.630 align:middle line:84%
was on our "Beyond Belief"
show, as she talked

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.465 align:middle line:90%
about helping law enforcement.

00:26:57.465 --> 00:26:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
come back, let's

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:90%
see if that's what you do, too.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.502 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Sure.

00:27:01.502 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I've worked for
law enforcement.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me about
those cases all the time.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes it's
giving a voice

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:10%
to somebody who needs a voice.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.620 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes it's helpful
to law enforcement officers.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.953 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, tell me how that works.

00:27:14.953 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:10%
What does a law enforcement
person want with you?

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think that
they're at their last resort.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.565 align:middle line:10%
That's when they bring us in.

00:27:21.565 --> 00:27:23.690 align:middle line:10%
Because it's usually a cold
case that I'll work on.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.065 align:middle line:10%
They don't have anything to
lose, so they'll bring me in.

00:27:26.065 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes it's information
about the actual case.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:10%
It's a trajectory
of information.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.930 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes it's a map or
something that I can draw.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.290 align:middle line:10%
But sometimes it
literally is communicating

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:10%
with a deceased loved one.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:41.720 align:middle line:10%
>> I had heard in some cases
where the psychic is so tuned

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:45.560 align:middle line:10%
in, that they tell the police
things only that the murderer

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.650 align:middle line:10%
would know, for example.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:47.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.640 align:middle line:10%
>> And that gets the psychic
looked at as a possible

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.440 align:middle line:10%
suspect.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.240 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, yeah.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.415 align:middle line:10%
We have to be
careful about that.

00:27:53.415 --> 00:27:54.230 align:middle line:10%
Sure.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:10%
I have a story in my book
that's really great about that.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.250 align:middle line:10%
I was shooting a pilot.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.410 align:middle line:10%
And I literally went
into a situation

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:04.442 align:middle line:10%
where I actually became the
perpetrator for a moment.

00:28:04.442 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:10%
And I was working
with a detective.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.960 align:middle line:10%
And I said, listen, I can feel
myself as the perpetrator.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.980 align:middle line:10%
That means the
perpetrator has passed on,

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:10%
so interrogate me like
you would if you were

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.770 align:middle line:10%
talking to the perpetrator.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:21.050 align:middle line:10%
And through me-- well, the
perpetrator and I drew a map.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:10%
And we took that map.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:10%
And we actually put it
on a map of Los Angeles.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.600 align:middle line:10%
This was in Orange
Grove, California--

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:10%
Garden Grove.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.300 align:middle line:10%
Excuse me.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:10%
And the lines were the freeways.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:10%
The star was actually the
murder that we were working on.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And the other elements were
of the other rapes and not

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:84%
necessarily murders
that were in that area.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, do you
work with law enforcement?

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: I have.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.140 align:middle line:90%
And I helped.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:84%
It was the Justice
Department, specifically

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:50.930 align:middle line:90%
in Northern California.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:55.130 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for
human bones in a very--

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.447 align:middle line:90%
a wide, open wilderness area.

00:28:57.447 --> 00:28:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They came to you?

00:28:58.530 --> 00:28:59.240 align:middle line:90%
You went to them?

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.532 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: You know what it was?

00:29:00.532 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Is someone found me.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:90%
They passed my name along.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.735 align:middle line:90%
That's always how it works.

00:29:04.735 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not like you put out--

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because the
people in law enforcement,

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.905 align:middle line:84%
as she was saying,
don't necessarily--

00:29:09.905 --> 00:29:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're skeptical.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: They're skeptical.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.835 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want to
have it out that, where

00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:90%
did you find this evidence?

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it was a psychic point.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A psychic told us.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Oh, so throw it out.

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.240 align:middle line:90%
It can't be worth anything.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hold that
up in court, right?

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: So I did
help with bones.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Very recently, though,
it was a cold case.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It was up in Spahn Ranch,
which is by Los Angeles.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.890 align:middle line:90%
It's the edge of LA County.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:84%
This woman that I
bumped into said

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:84%
that she was out hiking
in the Spahn Ranch area.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And she found an article
of clothing sticking out

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:90%
of the ground.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.440 align:middle line:90%
She pulled it out.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out to be
wrapped around a hunting

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.590 align:middle line:90%
knife, a large knife.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And so
I held the knife.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And I started to get details
about a guy that turned out

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:90%
to match.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember his
name, but Shorty Shea

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:84%
was one of the victims
of the Manson family.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to give his name,
I think Charles or something.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.160 align:middle line:84%
His given name wasn't
Shorty, but I heard the name.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:90%
I think it was Charles.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.760 align:middle line:84%
In any case, it was
the correct name

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.920 align:middle line:84%
of the guy who was
attached to this.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I described a bloody
fight, and that they--

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.020 align:middle line:90%
it was very interesting.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Because she didn't know
what to do with this knife.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.017 align:middle line:90%
And she also was told--

00:30:22.017 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a discovery.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yeah, so it was
a very interesting thing,

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:26.420 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't know this.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to shed
some light, also, too,

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:31.340 align:middle line:90%
with Sharon Tate.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.120 align:middle line:84%
She gave the name
to me of her son.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to validate
that even though she

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.120 align:middle line:84%
didn't give birth to him, they
had a name selected for him.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted people to know
that she's beautiful again,

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:50.942 align:middle line:84%
and that it is possible
to help with cold cases.

00:30:50.942 --> 00:30:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel good
about these when you do it?

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes, I do.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.890 align:middle line:84%
It's in particular-- truth be
known, my father was murdered.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And the murderer
was never found.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.740 align:middle line:90%


00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And I did find details about
him, but that man is deceased.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And my mom didn't want to
follow through, because it

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:90%
was related to organized crime.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And that going way back,
there was really not

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.160 align:middle line:84%
much we could do about
it, as we weren't

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:90%
involved with any of this.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And the police seemed reticent
to do more with us and for us.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was dad in the wrong
place at the wrong time?

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: I think so.

00:31:27.355 --> 00:31:29.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what I feel it was.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.020 align:middle line:10%
Because it made no sense
for him to be where he was,

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:37.250 align:middle line:10%
except that his car broke
down in a rough neighborhood

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.340 align:middle line:10%
in Brooklyn.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.630 align:middle line:10%
And it was at a time
in the late '60s when

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.842 align:middle line:10%
there was a lot of gang
violence happening.

00:31:44.842 --> 00:31:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And he happened to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wrong time.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Mark, how do people
get a hold of you?

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: You can go to
marknelsonmedium.com.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:53.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.492 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: That's my site.

00:31:54.492 --> 00:31:58.700 align:middle line:10%
And I do events,
private readings.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, thank you for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: My pleasure.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:02.150 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:02.360 align:middle line:90%
It was fun.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've talked to a lot
of psychic mediums in my career.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And he is so authentic.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.920 align:middle line:84%
The things he said about
me were all spot on.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.170 align:middle line:90%
And I never told him about it.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:11.970 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.770 align:middle line:90%
