00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.790 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.662 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.492 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.450 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:10%
As you know, I spent a lot
of time in Saint Louis.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:10%
And Saint Louis was where
the original exorcism

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:10%
of that little boy took
place many years ago.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:84%
It was probably one of the
most documented cases ever

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:90%
about exorcisms.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Our guest today on "Beyond
Belief," Deborah King-- shaman,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:84%
priestess, well-known "New
York Times" bestselling author.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:90%
She deals with dark forces.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.375 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea why.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Why would you do this?

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBORAH KING: It wasn't
intentional, George, at all.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:10%
It was because I was
seeking the light

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:10%
and working with a lot
of priests and shamans

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:10%
who are producers of light, but
who also work with the dark.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And I found out you
have to work with both.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the dark
side anyway, Deborah?

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.239 align:middle line:90%
What do you think that is?

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, it's really
our own inner darkness.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:10%
I know we much prefer
to project it out

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:10%
onto other people, other
nations, other continents.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.535 align:middle line:10%
But in fact, it starts within
each and every one of us.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:26.287 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's us?

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It is.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:90%
It's our own feelings.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:84%
We start when we're little
and some parent or caregiver

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
tells us that we won't be
loved if we're like that.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So we pretend that those
feelings aren't real.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:90%
We push them down somewhere.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:84%
By the time we're a
teenager, we don't even

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:84%
know we have those socially
unacceptable feelings.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're jealous
or we're greedy.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, all
feelings kids have.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's our darkness.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's the world's darkness.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not,
it's that simple.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you sense
darkness from normal people

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:84%
if you're just talking to them
in a day to day environment?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: I can, and I've
always been able to.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I
was a young lawyer,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
my business partners
would say to me, how can

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.350 align:middle line:84%
you sense that
about that client?

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say, I don't know.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, we all have
these capabilities.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of
us have in our body,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:90%
it's this amazing truth kit.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:84%
We can sense everything
about other people

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and we've just
sort of turned off.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But I help people learn how
to turn those senses back on.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:84%
They're referred
to as paranormal,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:90%
but they're not really.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:90%
They're actually human.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of being human.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:90%
We can sense.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do some
people get possessed?

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Why are some people evil
and some other people simply

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:90%
aren't?

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: I'm not sure that
there is a definitive answer.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is that, again, we
don't address our own darkness.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:90%
We split off from it.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:90%
We disown it.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:84%
That sets us up for dark
forces that are outside of us,

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.279 align:middle line:84%
And so some people
are just open to it,

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you
know, they've been zapped.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they are.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't feel as if there
are any dark forces around me,

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.270 align:middle line:90%
but might there be?

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, George,
you feel very light,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:90%
so I wouldn't be concerned.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.550 align:middle line:84%
But I think all of us need
to stay on it every day.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
The things that keep us
light are simple things

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.150 align:middle line:84%
like staying positive, having
more happy thoughts than not.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Clean air, good food,
a little bit of exercise,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
sunshine-- those are the
things that actually keep us

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:90%
in the light.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you
can let your guard down

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
no matter how intentioned
you are, right?

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: That's right.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that really
sets us up for darkness is,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.305 align:middle line:84%
oddly enough, is not
getting enough sleep.

00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds
simple, but it's true.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.054 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know,
that is interesting to me.

00:03:50.054 --> 00:03:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I know with myself, just because
of the nature of my late time

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:90%
radio show.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm up
early, getting things

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:90%
ready for the next program.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I probably get about
six hours a day.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Some people might say
that's not enough.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I don't feel
tired and I keep going.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.872 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, will it catch
up with me eventually?

00:04:09.872 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It might.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And you might pick up
the President Kennedy

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:90%
trick of a power nap.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Just a little--

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.164 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love power naps.

00:04:16.164 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh, 5 or 10 minutes.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:90%
10, 15 minutes, you're done.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Doesn't have to be long.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.507 align:middle line:90%
You look and feel great.

00:04:22.507 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a matter
of fact, the long ones,

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.340 align:middle line:84%
you wake up more tired,
I think sometimes.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.827 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: And then it throws you
off for your nighttime sleep.

00:04:29.827 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Deborah, I want to talk
with you about several facets

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of the other side--
the evil forces,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.960 align:middle line:84%
the demonic forces, but
also near-death experiences

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:90%
and life after death.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
You went through an episode
where you battled cancer.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:90%
You beat it.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:84%
You were not at death's
door by any means,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
but there are a lot of people
who go to the other side

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:90%
and come back.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.501 align:middle line:84%
What do you know, and what do
you feel, about the other side?

00:04:57.501 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.208 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, I actually
had a near-death experience.

00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that's what
it was called at the time.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But within a few years,
I learned about it.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I was on my first
date, actually,

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:90%
with the man I later married.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:90%
And he was a crazy Frenchman.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.446 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
a thing he said.

00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: His broken
English then?

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Or what?

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.003 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Right.

00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:90%
And not long here in the US.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:90%
And he was a mountain climber.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
show me mountain

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
climbing in the
middle of winter.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet he did.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Crazy driver.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:84%
We went up into the snows
and we started hiking

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:84%
up a river, this raging
torrent of a river.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
I forgot to tell him that
I didn't know anything

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:90%
about sports.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:90%
I was a bookworm.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I knew
how to do was swim.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.999 align:middle line:84%
And I kept looking at this
river and thinking, wow,

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:90%
I'd hate to fall on that thing.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:90%
You'd be a goner.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it was cold, right.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It was February.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.593 align:middle line:84%
And there's snow on
the ground and I'm

00:05:50.593 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:84%
hurrying, trying
to stay with him.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And he crossed the river on
a piece of solid granite.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:84%
The river went
underneath the granite

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:90%
for quite some distance.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And I ran across, trying
to keep him in sight.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.532 align:middle line:84%
And I slipped and I
fell through a pothole.

00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like ice.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: A little
pothole about this big.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Before we left the
car, he'd outfitted me

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
in-- I had heavy
boots and a coat.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And I had a rope tied around
me, a big, heavy rope.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I was pulled underneath into
the current of this river.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.640 align:middle line:90%
I knew.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.917 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you under water?

00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I'm trapped under there.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And the river is pulling
me along under the granite.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:26.601 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: And there were tree
stumps and big boulders.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.077 align:middle line:84%
And it's about 45
degrees, water.

00:06:32.077 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:90%
And I started.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
toast in minutes.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
I started to become

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.760 align:middle line:90%
very peaceful and very warm.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.871 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The hypothermia
was setting in.

00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:42.412 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:06:42.412 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this bright light
that I was going toward.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And I heard a voice
sort of give me

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
a life review, a very
quick life review.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard a
voice say, not yet.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:90%
And I popped up in a pool.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And some mountain climbers
on the side of the river

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:90%
threw me a rope and I got out.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.003 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:07:02.003 --> 00:07:03.132 align:middle line:90%
Now, where was the husband?

00:07:03.132 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:90%
Or the boyfriend at the time?

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Hey, he's
way upriver, trying

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:90%
to figure out where his date is.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.708 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had no
idea where you were.

00:07:08.708 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: No.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: So that was my
near-death experience.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And I don't urge people
to run out and have one.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:84%
It's one way to get
spiritual enlightenment,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:84%
spiritual evolution
very quickly.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
It's become far better
known these days.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
That's in large part thanks
to the amazing techniques

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:90%
they have now for resuscitation.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
are having them.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could have frozen
to death out there, then.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.411 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Lots of people.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's a prominent
science writer

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.866 align:middle line:84%
right now who says
it's misnamed.

00:07:36.866 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't be near death.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:90%
It should be after death.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Because in fact--

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
you have passed on.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: --you have to died.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:90%
And there's some classic signs.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:90%
I had a few of them.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:90%
That sense of peace.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.819 align:middle line:84%
The tunnel effect or
stairway is very common.

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you see the light?

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I saw the light.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people,
they'll hear a voice.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And so there's some
common denominators

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:90%
to these experiences.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When it was all done,
weeks later, months later,

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:90%
did you change at all?

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Did you get more intuitive?

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Did anything kick in?

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Something happened
to me immediately.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I noticed just within
the first few hours

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.690 align:middle line:84%
that I liked myself better,
that I felt more loved.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:90%
It was the oddest thing.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:90%
It happened out of the blue.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And I now, having read over
the years all the literature

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.970 align:middle line:84%
on this-- it's a
really common feeling.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:84%
So one of the higher
spiritual realities

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.059 align:middle line:84%
is that we are
unconditionally loved.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:38.794 align:middle line:84%
It's just hard as
heck to feel it here.

00:08:38.794 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to feel the love.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.419 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: You know?

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.492 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:41.492 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Deborah, you became
a "New York Times" bestselling

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
author as you began to
document these stories

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and these episodes
that were out there.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Is there a common
denominator here about people

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to battle
demonic forces and evil?

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Are they in some
similar environment?

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Compared to a
near-death experience?

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.814 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or compared to
people who aren't, I guess.

00:09:04.814 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: They're kind
of the opposite.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.128 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're kind
of the opposite.

00:09:07.128 --> 00:09:11.941 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:90%
They're pulled down.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:84%
They're coming away
from the light.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's interesting
with near-death experiences.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:90%
20% of them are dark.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:90%
They're very dark.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:90%
And no one knows why.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:84%
They've been studied
and it has nothing

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:84%
to do with their
religious beliefs

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:84%
or whether they were
a suicide attempt.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.530 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be random.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.735 align:middle line:84%
I think it's far more connected
to where they are spiritually.

00:09:34.735 --> 00:09:37.972 align:middle line:84%
Are they dealing with their
dislike of themselves?

00:09:37.972 --> 00:09:39.430 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
one of the biggest,

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:84%
is if we don't like ourselves,
it pulls us way down.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.150 align:middle line:90%
It pulls us toward darkness.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those individuals
who hurt people,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:84%
whether they are serial
killers or greedy people,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:90%
something's wrong with them.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's part
of the brain or it's part

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:84%
of these forces that
have changed them.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.322 align:middle line:90%
Is it a combination of the both?

00:10:05.322 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: I think
it's a combination.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
set themselves

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:84%
up by not dealing with
their negative emotions.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:84%
They get into
addictive behavior.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, addictive behavior
is a band-aid for us.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:84%
I tried it all myself
before I had cancer.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
When I was young,
I tried drinking,

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I tried drugs, I
tried this, anything

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I could get my hands
on, to not feel.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.105 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the thing
that really opens us up

00:10:29.105 --> 00:10:30.209 align:middle line:90%
to the dark forces.

00:10:30.209 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you that way
when you were a little girl?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you remember battling
your parents over everything?

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Everything.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I had a pretty
dark childhood.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's that
kind of personality.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I know my daughter, much
like you, same thing.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:90%
And then she grew out of it.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Now she's a wonderful
young woman with two kids.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
But we had to battle
her every step

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:90%
of the way over everything.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And she had that kind
of personality, too.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Type A, I call it.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Or type A plus.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.225 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah, A plus.

00:11:06.225 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's tough.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people
out there that have this.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.280 align:middle line:84%
These demonic forces
that are out there,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
or the so-called evil, why is
it there in the first place?

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, I think
there's a balance

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.210 align:middle line:90%
in the universe of good and bad.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:23.597 align:middle line:90%
But why is it there?

00:11:23.597 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Well, that's the reason.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Again, for us to be able
to assimilate at a higher

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness-- that
maybe this is after were' gone,

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:90%
George, and we're dead.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're living on another
plane where everything is one.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Here on Earth, we are able
to see the vast differences

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.540 align:middle line:84%
of black and white, and night
and day, and good and evil.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And it allows us to understand
better and improve ourselves.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:84%
We're here to improve
ourselves constantly.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully we're constantly
working on ourselves.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we surrounded
by these dark forces?

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.216 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: We are.

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.180 align:middle line:90%
We are indeed.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And I never wanted
to focus on them.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to work with people
and take them to the light.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But in order to do
that, I have to be

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:90%
able to deal with the dark, too.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
gone into a room, a party,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.980 align:middle line:90%
and you can sense it?

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.521 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Sure.

00:12:11.521 --> 00:12:14.889 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can sense something
out there or an individual?

00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah, and
I bet you have too.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:17.311 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:18.890 align:middle line:84%
No, no, we're all
capable of this.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It's built into our bodies.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:10%
We have this sense.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.970 align:middle line:10%
We know when we're dealing
with someone who's dark,

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:10%
or we're in a room
that's dark, or a home.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.274 align:middle line:90%
We need to be careful.

00:12:31.274 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We talked in our
previous program about how

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.510 align:middle line:84%
to combat this, how
to fight it off,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and you had some items
that you showed us,

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them household
items, but they tend to work,

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.866 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: They do.

00:12:44.866 --> 00:12:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
old wives' tales.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there are a lot
of things that you can do.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, to clear a
house, one of the most common

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:84%
would be to take Epsom salts
and a little bit alcohol,

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.267 align:middle line:84%
and mix the two in
a small container.

00:13:02.267 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Now, be careful with this.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have to be.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to blow
yourself up, right?

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: You don't want
to burn the house down.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible because
this gets very hot.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That'll get
rid of everything.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
You'll want to have
a helper, and you

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.295 align:middle line:90%
want to have oven mitts.

00:13:12.295 --> 00:13:14.155 align:middle line:84%
And you pour a little
bit of alcohol on

00:13:14.155 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:90%
and you light the thing.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And the gas that rises off of
it actually clears a space.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And so you just go around.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.511 align:middle line:90%
You can clear your whole house.

00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:23.920 align:middle line:90%
You can clear people.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
best ways to clear.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:31.070 align:middle line:84%
You can also clear
objects with sage.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.409 align:middle line:90%
You can clear people with sage.

00:13:32.409 --> 00:13:33.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit harder.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you burn this.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:34.915 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: You do.

00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:90%
You light it and it has a smoke.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.649 align:middle line:84%
This is a good American
Indian technique.

00:13:39.649 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, where do
you buy-- obviously,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to buy
this at your supermarket.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: You buy that at
the health food store.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Just like this?

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Just like that.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And then to put it
out, you just douse it

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.187 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit of dirt, or a
little bit of water, or sand.

00:13:52.187 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:90%
And then you can reuse it.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A health food store?

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.043 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Right, yeah.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: It'll be over
there hanging on the wall.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't know that.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.125 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:90%
It has a great smell.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.955 align:middle line:90%
Smell it.

00:14:00.955 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it is.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Isn't that terrific?

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.081 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:14:03.081 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
No, sage is a long-standing
traditional technique

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.864 align:middle line:84%
for clearing people,
rooms, objects.

00:14:11.864 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, it leaves a residue of
smell of the smoke in the room,

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:84%
so you don't want to do
this in a hotel room.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.933 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:16.933 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Why is there so
much evil out there?

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, that's a
very difficult question.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.290 align:middle line:90%
I think there's more evil today.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I really think that while
man and humankind is ever

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:84%
increasing, and higher
vibration, and moving

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:38.050 align:middle line:84%
toward the light, I think the
dark tries to defeat that.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And so there appears to
be stronger and, I think,

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:41.790 align:middle line:90%
more evil.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:90%
That's my own perception.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we being
bombarded by evil?

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.567 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: To a
degree, to a degree.

00:14:46.567 --> 00:14:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But there's so many ways
we can stay in the light.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you feel like
you're not safe,

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:84%
I would recommend that you clear
yourself, clear your space.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Now here's another.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:90%
This is Rescue Remedy.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a flower remedy.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.400 align:middle line:84%
It's available in
any Whole Foods.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:90%
You can get this anywhere.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.266 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you do with this?

00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, you can spray
it on the room, on yourself.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that?

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.061 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:15:13.061 --> 00:15:15.560 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a great neutralizer.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:90%
It' neutralizes dark energy.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.012 align:middle line:90%
You can also ingest it.

00:15:21.012 --> 00:15:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can?

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: You can.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.261 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:15:23.261 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:90%
It comes in drops.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.730 align:middle line:84%
This happens to be
spray, because it's

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.625 align:middle line:90%
more effective for a room.

00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:29.536 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you
see instant results?

00:15:29.536 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:90%
Or does it take time?

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.284 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Rescue Remedy,
I see instant results.

00:15:32.284 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll see your field
change, your energy field.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you see auras?

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I do.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm not big on seeing.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you why.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:84%
The clairvoyant gift is the most
misleading of all the gifts.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I prefer people use their
gut and their instinct.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:90%
It's much more real.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
You get far fewer
false readings.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:84%
You can get a lot of false
readings with clairvoyance.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.054 align:middle line:84%
You can also get people
who get very proud

00:16:00.054 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:90%
about the whole thing.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So I prefer that they
use their, your center.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.936 align:middle line:84%
Your center tells you
what's true and what isn't.

00:16:07.936 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about people, Deborah,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:84%
who conjure up dark
forces and evil.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:90%
They ask for it.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.620 align:middle line:90%
They pray for it.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And it shows up whether
it's through a Ouija

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.585 align:middle line:90%
board or a chant.

00:16:21.585 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:90%
They just do.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:90%
You know, spells.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Wow.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Super dangerous stuff.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.360 align:middle line:90%
That is so dangerous, you know?

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
letting it in, right?

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:33.441 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Well, yeah.

00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Ouija boards, and seances,
and things like that

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:90%
are not playthings.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:44.590 align:middle line:84%
You need someone with skills
to lead something like that

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:84%
because you are inviting
spirits to come in

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and you can get the
wrong one in the room.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And it or that force can
invade maybe the weakest

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.217 align:middle line:90%
person in the group.

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these forces don't
want to leave either, do they?

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: No, no.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:90%
They're often misguided.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Lots of times it's
a soul who's died,

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:84%
a person who's not
left this realm.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.548 align:middle line:84%
And so what we should be doing
is helping them onto the light.

00:17:12.548 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:90%
They're stuck here.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.600 align:middle line:84%
They're stuck in
kind of a gray zone.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Catholic
Church, of course,

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.109 align:middle line:84%
has a number of priests
dedicated to exorcisms.

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:84%
I don't know any other organized
religion that has that.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.402 align:middle line:84%
They're darn serious
about this, aren't they?

00:17:29.402 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: They are.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were remarkably
agreeable to allowing

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:90%
me to learn from them.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.247 align:middle line:84%
They never made me
leave the church.

00:17:37.247 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:84%
They would allow me to
come right up to the front.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
that whole experience.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.148 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: That's
quite an experience.

00:17:42.148 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:90%
It's very real.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And the books and films
that we have, culturally--

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:84%
"Rosemary's Baby,"
"The Exorcist"--

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:54.100 align:middle line:84%
the reason we like those is
because they are living out

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:84%
something we all sense, that is
a cultural experience that we

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:90%
have on our unconscious.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So the Catholic Church
is quite big on it.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I've also studied
a lot with shamans

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.819 align:middle line:84%
in South America who use
very similar procedures.

00:18:07.819 --> 00:18:09.360 align:middle line:84%
They just call it
by different names,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.802 align:middle line:90%
but it's all the same energy.

00:18:10.802 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Deborah,
poltergeist activities,

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:84%
where they kind of
invade the home,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:90%
people can't get rid of them.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:90%
What did they do?

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Did they do it themselves?

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Did they hire experts like you?

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And if they do, how do
they find people like you?

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, just
go on the internet.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.700 align:middle line:90%
I bet they're very available.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I would encourage people
to call someone in a field

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.360 align:middle line:84%
that they already
feel comfortable in.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
For one person it might be
their religious background.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:84%
For someone else,
maybe they feel

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:90%
drawn to an American Indian.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:84%
But there are practitioners
in every culture.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
you're getting a good one?

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Use your intuition.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Again, use your gut.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel
when they get there?

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.176 align:middle line:84%
What's your sense when you
talk to them on the phone?

00:18:51.176 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you do
these events or seminars

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:84%
around the country,
what do people ask for?

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.844 align:middle line:90%
What do they want to know?

00:18:57.844 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: People are looking
for all different things.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.469 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people
who come and think

00:19:01.469 --> 00:19:03.009 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
getting the light

00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:04.790 align:middle line:84%
actually need to be
cleared of the dark.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's the
other way around.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It's always an unforeseen
thing until they actually

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:90%
walk up to me.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In some
of these events,

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:20.070 align:middle line:84%
have you come across an episode
that even you went whoa?

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:90%
One of those kinds of things?

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: All the time.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.164 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: All the time.

00:19:23.164 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:84%
There's at least one
whoa at every event.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:90%
And you just never know.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm just thinking back to
an event, a recent event

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:84%
in Florida, where the gal
started speaking in tongues--

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:90%
or so it sounded to me at first.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.816 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gutteral?

00:19:41.816 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yes, it
was very foreign.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was sure that it
wasn't of the light.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So speaking in tongues
is usually of the light,

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:84%
but this felt very,
very dark to me.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw the
replay on tape later,

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:90%
I realized I was right.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.925 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a
demonic possession.

00:19:57.925 --> 00:19:59.050 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty scary.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is this going
on in front of an audience?

00:20:00.675 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It was.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
panic and freak out?

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.586 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: They do.

00:20:04.586 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I had three rows run out
of an auditorium one time.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.881 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:08.422 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:20:08.422 --> 00:20:09.297 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no, no.

00:20:09.297 --> 00:20:09.955 align:middle line:90%
Wait, wait.

00:20:09.955 --> 00:20:10.746 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Come back!

00:20:10.746 --> 00:20:12.534 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: They're coming
after me, not you.

00:20:12.534 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about children?

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Are they faced with
these kinds of issues?

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: You know, kids can
sense it automatically.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:90%
Children are unlike us.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
They still know when there's
a spirit in the room.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say I'm
talking to grandma.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.850 align:middle line:90%
She's here.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And the parents are like,
no, no, she died years ago.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:90%
That's your imagination.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:84%
But see, children are
more open to other planes.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
also susceptible

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.360 align:middle line:84%
to demonic forces trying
to take over them?

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: They are,
but I think less so.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:90%
I see this much more in adults.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Far, far less in children.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had earlier,
in our first program,

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:84%
talked about a spirit
or demonic force

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.330 align:middle line:90%
that you saw in your room.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of kids will complain
about somebody in the closet.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.060 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of
something under the bed.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I know it's kind
of freaky to put

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.945 align:middle line:90%
your arm over the side of a bed.

00:21:03.945 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like feel
someone's going

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
to reach under and grab
it and stuff like that.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.732 align:middle line:90%
Are they witnessing something?

00:21:09.732 --> 00:21:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: They are.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they talk
about, mommy, there's

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.760 align:middle line:84%
something in the closet, is
there something in there?

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: They can sense it.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:15.185 align:middle line:90%
They can sense it.

00:21:15.185 --> 00:21:17.685 align:middle line:84%
And so can your dog, your cat,
and if you brought your horse

00:21:17.685 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:84%
in the house, he'd be
able to sense it too.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:90%
We can all sense these things.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.674 align:middle line:84%
It's just adults have--
out of necessity,

00:21:23.674 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:84%
they turn all of
these senses off.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've shut it off.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.185 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah,
we've shut it down.

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And in an emergency or a tight
situation, it turns back on.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does this
take us in the future?

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Does it get better?

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Does it get worse?

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.979 align:middle line:84%
In terms of trying to combat
this evil that's out there.

00:21:43.979 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: I think
we're getting better.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:84%
My sense is we're
going up, but we're

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.200 align:middle line:84%
clearing the darkness
very quickly now.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I believe that since
about the year 2000,

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed more and
more people really having

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.615 align:middle line:84%
amazing spiritual--
what I call initiations.

00:21:58.615 --> 00:21:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Awakenings.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.251 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:01.530 align:middle line:90%
And I feel it in my body.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.070 align:middle line:90%
And then they feel it.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a fact that we
are moving up because the spirit

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
world senses that we're
in a bit of a crisis.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
giving more and more

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:84%
advanced consciousness
to people, giving them

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:90%
opportunities to step up.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I find more
people are truly tuned

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.697 align:middle line:84%
in and aware of
what is out there.

00:22:23.697 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Right.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These forces
that are out there.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:34.750 align:middle line:84%
We are bombarded with horrible
news stories all the time.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Does that affect people?

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they let
their guard down

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:84%
when they get depressed and
sad over stuff like that?

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Absolutely.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.439 align:middle line:10%
And you want to know
what's going on.

00:22:44.439 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:10%
It's critical that we know
what's going on in the world

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:10%
but not take it in over
and over and over again.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.950 align:middle line:10%
Get your news.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.250 align:middle line:10%
Get it in 5 or 10 minutes.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.420 align:middle line:10%
And then don't watch the
same thing all day long.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.187 align:middle line:10%
It really does bring you down.

00:22:57.187 --> 00:22:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:84%
You got to be very careful it
doesn't affect you and destroy

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:90%
you that way.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: We want to
be all connected

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.479 align:middle line:84%
and know what's going
on around the world,

00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:84%
but you don't want to allow
it to pull you into darkness.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.944 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you are convinced
it can hurt your health.

00:23:11.944 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It's happened to me.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.694 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:13.694 --> 00:23:15.693 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: You might have
had this experience, too.

00:23:15.693 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:90%
I think most people have.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:90%
We have to be careful.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I advise against violence--
violent movies, violent video

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.840 align:middle line:90%
games.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just not a good idea
to take all that stuff

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.487 align:middle line:84%
into your body and into
your own energy field.

00:23:28.487 --> 00:23:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.025 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
take that for granted.

00:23:31.025 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:90%
They really do.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.809 align:middle line:84%
Deborah, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Great being here.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So if you
ever are confronted

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:10%
with some kind of evil
force, there are great people

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:10%
out there like Deborah
King, author, of course,

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:10%
of one of her books,
"Entangled in Darkness."

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.960 align:middle line:10%
You can fight
these evil spirits.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:84%
