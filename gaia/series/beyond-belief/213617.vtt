Krys Ra El with us, Noeticist,
soul guide and ether physicist

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:10%
who provides an enticing
atmosphere for the soul

Quite a field you're in, Krys.

Welcome to the show.

>>KRYS RA EL: you, George.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

>>RA EL: Amazing.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.237 align:middle line:84%
It's been an amazing experience
here in Boulder, Colorado.

>>NOORY: Looking
forward to meeting you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
after your great debut
on the radio show.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
funny because I know

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.847 align:middle line:84%
we had that interview
a while ago,

00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and now, here we
are in the physical.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:90%
So instant materialization.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a Noeticist?

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:10%
>>RA EL: A Noeticist
is someone who

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:10%
understands reality
from inside themselves,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:10%
inside their own mind.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a Noeticist, meaning
that a lot of my downloads

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and insights stem from
my own consciousness

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:84%
without any external
influences, books.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a streamline
of information that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:90%
comes straight from the source.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Krys, the late
Apollo 14 Astronaut

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Mitchell started
an organization,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
the Institute of
Noetic Sciences,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.630 align:middle line:90%
very similar to what you do.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:90%
I actually did not know that.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's another hint at
what noetics really is.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it still exists,
so it's still out there.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:90%
You should look them up.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
they'd love you.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:90%
How did you get into this?

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:10%
>>RA EL: So I am here
to offer information,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:10%
wisdom to help
humanity move forward.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So how I got into
this is by being it.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.830 align:middle line:90%
So this is who I am.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I've been
called to do from the source,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:90%
you could say, my own heart.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of
profound experiences

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that are very mystical, but
yet grounding at the same time.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So just taking those
chances to share

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:90%
those experiences with people.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You call
yourself a Starwalker.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: So it's
like a Starseed.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But I don't identify
with one race.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I see myself as an expression of
the source, more of an Ethereum,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:84%
a being who has
become self-aware.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I've had many
different incarnations

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and different realms, different
lifetimes, planets, species.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So I walk amongst the stars,
gaining wisdom and knowledge

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and sharing it with
developing races.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've had an ET
contactee experience, too,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.280 align:middle line:90%
haven't you?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Had plenty.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.048 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did this evolve?

00:02:47.048 --> 00:02:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Since you were a little boy?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Ever since I was
young, I would have

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:90%
very vivid and lucid dreams.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.740 align:middle line:90%
I remember being on different--

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
you could say planets, but,
you know, different crafts.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And I would also meet
people in waking life

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:84%
who would be there one moment
and then disappear the next.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Come to find out, these
were ETs showing up

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:90%
to me in the physical--

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
to help me stay on the path,
help me develop the way

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:90%
I was meant to.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's not including
my walking experience.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.012 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
all benevolent?

00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Every experience--
every experience I've had

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:84%
has been positive,
and I've never

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:90%
had a negative ET experience.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But that's also
because my mission here

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:90%
is one of benevolence.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
If my mission here
was not, then I

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
may have alternative
experiences.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.587 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a good guy.

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: I would like to say so.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a very strange
phone call once, didn't you?

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.165 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes, I did.

00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
take a look at it.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: OK.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.627 align:middle line:90%

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:90%
You want to hang up?

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.045 align:middle line:90%

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:90%
They can not control you.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.515 align:middle line:90%
They can not hurt you.

00:05:01.515 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.256 align:middle line:90%

00:05:14.678 --> 00:05:18.136 align:middle line:90%
They can not control you.

00:05:21.594 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:90%
They can not hurt you.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Krys, what
was that all about?

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Where to begin?

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So that was-- so I
got to preface this

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
by saying a lot of
ET communication

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:84%
isn't just done
through channeling.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not done through just
people sitting in meditation.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's
experiences like this

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
or you meet people on
the street and they're

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:90%
from a different planet--

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Through electronics
and stuff like that.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: So a
couple of years ago,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I was outside making contact,
looking at starships in the sky,

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and I said, can you
come through the phone?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Because at that point in time,
I had a device on my phone

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
that could measure the
electromagnetic field.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And if there was another energy
around it, it would beep.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened that night.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But the next day, they
came through the phone.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And what I think is a profound
about that video is that--

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it from
a logistical standpoint,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:84%
there's my partner
on the other end.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.180 align:middle line:84%
She can't-- she can hear
me, but I can't hear her.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
But then she also cannot hear
this other voice that's coming

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So there is something
otherworldly

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:90%
happening with that cell phone.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And my star team was
interfacing, basically saying,

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.420 align:middle line:84%
hey, we're here, listen to
yourself, they cannot hurt you,

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:90%
they cannot control you.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:84%
The reason it
sounds so distorted

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:84%
is because the
technology that they use

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
is so far beyond a
cell phone that it's

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:84%
like us trying to
communicate with people

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:90%
who live in the jungle using--

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tin cans.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.145 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Tin cans or something.

00:06:55.145 --> 00:06:55.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:55.945 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: So-- yeah.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there a caller ID
that showed up by any chance?

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: There was no caller ID.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:90%
There was no call failed.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:90%
Nothing like that.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
It was just a simple
voice that came through,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.560 align:middle line:90%
but nothing else changed.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:90%
So it was real.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
an iPhone do that.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's strange.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
feel scared at all?

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: No, not at all.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.380 align:middle line:90%
I felt curious.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:90%
I actually felt really excited.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.180 align:middle line:10%
And I-- wanted to learn
who was behind that call.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that I've come
to that conclusion present day.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who do
you think that was?

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: It was my it
was my star family.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:10%
It was my star team, at least
the ones who are in orbit.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Like I said, I'm a walk-in.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in an immersion
program, which

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:84%
means my consciousness is being
streamed from a different star

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:90%
system in Earth orbit.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think they
intentionally diffuse that

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:90%
call to make it sound that way?

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: No, I don't.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Because that's not--
there's a six-minute video.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.380 align:middle line:90%
That's not the full video.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:84%
In that call, I ask, is this
our technology or yours?

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I say something like,
I can't understand you

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:90%
and they say yours.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, ETs are not allowed to
use their regular voices,

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.787 align:middle line:84%
so they can only use
distorted AI sounding voices.

00:08:18.787 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is what we heard.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Right.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Because it goes against
Galactic Federation

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Laws to have direct
interference like that.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So they go around a few
loopholes to communicate.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Krys, give
us your overview

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:84%
of what you think
the human race is.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: What do I think it is?

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I'm sure
you've taken a look at it

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.975 align:middle line:90%
in a perspective.

00:08:41.975 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you think there are
other humans on other planetary

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:90%
systems?

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:90%
So the human race is--

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:90%
an emanation of the source.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.810 align:middle line:90%
It's emanation of the ether.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Humans were not-- humans did
not originate from planet Earth.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
DNA manipulation

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:90%
that generated the human being.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Humans are really Lyrans.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people assume
that Lyrans are cat people

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:90%
and they're not.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Humans, this biological
form is actually

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:84%
what we would call
a space human.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So humans are actually
interdimensional

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.840 align:middle line:90%
ETs, asleep, unaware of that.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Most humans are unaware of their
galactic or cosmic identity.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's the work I
do is help people come

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:90%
into that remembrance.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We are in now
into the third dimension.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:84%
But many people talk
about the fifth dimension,

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
which is a higher
plane of consciousness.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
What do you think of the
humans ascending into that?

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: I think that
all realities are

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:90%
based on thoughts and ideas.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension is not
a plane that you reach.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a concept.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a state of
being that is birthed

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:90%
through your own awareness.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:84%
The more that you can perceive
about reality, the more access

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:90%
you have to it.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
about what dimension,

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
it's more about what you think
is possible or not possible,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:84%
what you think you
can or cannot do.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.918 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What can we do?

00:10:05.918 --> 00:10:07.835 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Whatever we
want to do, whatever we--

00:10:07.835 --> 00:10:08.635 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unlimited?

00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Unlimited.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Unlimited.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:15.320 align:middle line:84%
We're only limited by the fact
that we have picked up programs

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:90%
that make us feel limited.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.340 align:middle line:90%
But humanity is not biological.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:90%
We are the source.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:90%
We are the ether.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.757 align:middle line:84%
So we can do whatever we put
our minds to quite literally.

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:90%
And there's physics behind that.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why I teach ether physics
about how that all takes place.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
Zecharia Sitchin

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.360 align:middle line:84%
was convinced that some kind
of life form on this planet

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:90%
was altered, and here we are.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And he believes that a race
called the Anunnaki came

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:90%
from another planet.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.510 align:middle line:90%
That is in our solar system.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And a 3,600-year
elliptical orbit,

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.950 align:middle line:84%
it goes way out and comes
back, way out and comes back.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Is that conceivable that they
genetically altered whatever

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:90%
was on the planet at the time?

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: It's conceivable,
because anything is conceivable,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:90%
but it's not accurate.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a little truth
to every-- just kidding,

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I like to say, so
you do not alter DNA

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:84%
through manipulating
it physically.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.370 align:middle line:90%
You alter it by your thoughts.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you tell a
people a certain thing

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.725 align:middle line:84%
and they start to
believe it, their DNA

00:11:19.725 --> 00:11:21.140 align:middle line:90%
will start to reflect that.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's consciousness
that alters the DNA.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, the Anunnaki are
not one group of people.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:84%
They are a conglomeration
of ET races

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of
different agendas.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the history
that we're taught

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
is meant to keep humans
in a loop spiraling

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.842 align:middle line:84%
without actually giving
them the keys to freedom.

00:11:42.842 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I like to
do, is give people the keys

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:90%
to their own transcendence.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about DNA?

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Where does that fit in?

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: DNA is living memory.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Your DNA is only limited
to what you personally feel

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:90%
is possible or not possible.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people think that
if you do a certain thing,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:90%
you activate your DNA.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:84%
You activate your DNA through
your own consciousness,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:90%
through your own mind.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if I
believe that I can only

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:84%
walk and have this
physical experience,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:84%
then my DNA is going
to reflect that.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
If I transcend those limiting
thoughts and beliefs,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:84%
now I create the etheric pulse
rhythms that bring in the--

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:84%
or I could say generate
that belief system.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:30.960 align:middle line:90%
We call that DNA.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Krys, we mentioned
you're an ether physicist, as

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:90%
well as a Noeticist.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:90%
What is an ether physicist?

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: So I study
the frameworks

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:84%
of reality, the
principle of creation,

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
you could say, the
principle of being,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and where a lot of
science modern science

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.180 align:middle line:90%
is based in hard matter.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I go beyond that into the
thing that generates matter.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that that is
the keys to our transcending

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:84%
our earthly experience
is going into the ether,

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.680 align:middle line:84%
going into the source and
studying the principles of how

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:84%
energy moves, how consciousness
constructs itself, things that--

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:90%
things of that nature.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this
information come to you?

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Noetically.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm a Noeticist.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Telepathically?

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I meditate a lot and--

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:84%
one of the things about me
is I allow myself to get

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:90%
into very deep states of being.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And in that state of
being is all information.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And so understanding
what I truly am,

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:90%
not just a human being.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:47.060 align:middle line:84%
I have access to information
because I don't block myself.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it comes through me
in meditation through dream.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you know it's real?

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: How do
I know it's real?

00:13:54.630 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that what we do is
we think that imagination is not

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:84%
real, but imagination is
the only thing that is real.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Before you think of anything,
it happens in your mind first.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's real because
I give it validity.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't depend on
any external source

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.870 align:middle line:84%
to validate anything
that I have experienced.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we ever
into a DNA upgrade?

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.243 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:14:23.243 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: All the time.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Upgrades, downgrades,
medium grades because--

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who does the upgrading?

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Each individual
consciousness.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.183 align:middle line:90%
Each soul.

00:14:31.183 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We do it ourselves?

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: We do it ourselves.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, I will say something
about that, though.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.930 align:middle line:84%
If you take 12 people and
you put them in a room

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:43.613 align:middle line:84%
and you say that this
is the year 1933, right?

00:14:43.613 --> 00:14:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, you know, it's
2024, but we took 12 people,

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:90%
we put them in a room.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:84%
We set up the room to
look like it's 1933.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:90%
We talk about 1933.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Their bodies will start
to change to mirror 1933

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's the environment
that they're now picking up

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:90%
on that is shifting their ideas.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And so you can see
in that example

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:90%
that DNA is simply a memory.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:90%
It's what you think is real.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.575 align:middle line:84%
It's what you think
is possible or not.

00:15:13.575 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not based on anything
other than the mind.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some believe that
Earth is a prison planet, Krys,

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
that the souls are
just stuck here.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
of that concept?

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: That's a limited way of
thinking because it's a thought

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.570 align:middle line:84%
pattern that is spread
throughout different spiritual

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:39.240 align:middle line:84%
communities to create
an effect of limitation.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's true.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Because when I understand
myself and you and everyone

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:84%
else as an emanation of
the ether, as the source,

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:84%
then what we deem
to be possible is.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.218 align:middle line:84%
So that's one narrative
that people can fit into.

00:15:56.218 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Earth is a prison planet.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.810 align:middle line:90%
On some level, I could see that.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But that's until you
understand that you're

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:84%
the one creating the conditions
through your misinterpretation

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And once you transcend
that, you can come

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:90%
into a higher state of being.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I find you to
be very enlightened.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Am I right?

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: You tell me.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:90%
That would be-- up to you.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I interviewed
you once on a radio show.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:84%
This is our first "Beyond
Belief" program with you.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem
very enlightened.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a compliment.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Thank you.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:90%
And I appreciate the compliment.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And I hesitate because I know
that even the advanced, the most

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:84%
advanced being in reality
is just beginning.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Because time is not-- time
is not a linear thing.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.440 align:middle line:90%
It's eternal.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is time
and consciousness?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:90%
Are they related?

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Very related.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.280 align:middle line:90%
Time is consciousness.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So time is the
awareness of being.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So when you are aware of
yourself, as something,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:90%
you create time.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Time is not something
held on a clock.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:84%
We say, how long
have you been here?

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:90%
We have 45 minutes.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.960 align:middle line:84%
That clock is simply keeping
track of a point of focus.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:90%
But it's not time.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So time is the linear
progression of one's thoughts.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it so
important to understand

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:90%
how time functions, Krys?

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Because time
leads to gravity.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:84%
It leads to different
kinds of energy, functions,

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.290 align:middle line:90%
and abilities.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.332 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would have
loved talking with Albert

00:17:37.332 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Einstein in his day.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:10%
>>RA EL: Him and Tesla
and Maxwell Faraday

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.510 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of those guys.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:84%
But yes, so time is
important because it's

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.250 align:middle line:90%
the framework of everything.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
When you understand what time
is, you understand what you are,

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:84%
time is the last thing that
gets dissolved before you

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:90%
become your pure self again.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:84%
If you think of the ocean and
you take one drop of that ocean.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And you move it to another drop,
another part of the ocean, still

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:90%
the ocean.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, it is.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: So time
is the same thing.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.655 align:middle line:84%
No matter where
you're at, you're

00:18:18.655 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:84%
still in the flow of the
ether, of the source.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you compress time?

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Can you change time?

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes, you can.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.376 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:25.376 --> 00:18:26.176 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How?

00:18:26.176 --> 00:18:28.510 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: You need to
focus on your thoughts.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:84%
If you focus and you close
your eyes and you become aware,

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of maybe
going for a hike.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
If I can follow and I
can feel that energy,

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.540 align:middle line:90%
it creates a gravity.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm going for a hike.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.740 align:middle line:84%
I see myself going
down the trail.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.480 align:middle line:90%
That is time.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.330 align:middle line:90%
That linear movement is time.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to switch to
whenever I was five years old

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:90%
eating a piece of candy.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, I've traveled back in time.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
If you do this
consistently enough,

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.620 align:middle line:84%
you could literally
teleport from one part

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:84%
of the ether to another because
you change your etheric pulse

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:90%
rhythm.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.310 align:middle line:84%
You become the space that
you are thinking about.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does it seem
like the older we get,

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:90%
the faster time goes by?

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: That's a great
question, George, because--

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.435 align:middle line:90%
we think that there's an end.

00:19:21.435 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we try to
hurry up and get

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.810 align:middle line:84%
things done because we
think that the end is

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.150 align:middle line:84%
coming because we don't
comprehend our eternal nature.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And so humans live this very
hurry, hurry, hurry, pace.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And so time seems
like it's slipping out

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.750 align:middle line:84%
of our hands instead
of understanding

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.290 align:middle line:84%
what time really is, which
is just our thoughts.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And so as we get older, we don't
live in that theta wave anymore.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:84%
We see more rushed through
our life from society,

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.690 align:middle line:90%
from the world we live in.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could
travel back in time,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:90%
where would you go?

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.750 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: So I would say if I
could change my etheric pulse

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.840 align:middle line:84%
rhythm and fit a different
frequency experience,

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I would experience what some
would call a future where

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:84%
humanity understands
the concepts I'm

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:90%
looking to share with them.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, from that vantage point,
the future and the past

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.940 align:middle line:90%
are the same thing.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.508 align:middle line:84%
They're not two
different things.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is the
physicist in you popping up.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: This is--
it's coming out.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I can't hide it.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what I would do.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.900 align:middle line:84%
I would create an
etheric pulse rhythm

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:84%
where I can experience harmony
within this specific human

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.998 align:middle line:84%
collective and see people
transcend their limited beliefs.

00:20:33.998 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you want to
go back to a specific event,

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:41.353 align:middle line:84%
maybe witnessing Jesus
Christ or something?

00:20:41.353 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Touchy topic.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:90%
Touchy topic.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I would rather go and
experience the times

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.640 align:middle line:84%
whenever ETs were on the
planet communicating directly

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.265 align:middle line:84%
with humans without there being
any protocols or anything.

00:20:58.265 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what I would
want to experience.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was working
on a script for a movie

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Mm-hmm.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Never got
made, but it came close.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where a
college professor

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:90%
invented a time machine.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Mm-hmm.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
made it specifically

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:84%
to want to go back into
time to save Jesus.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:90%
And so he made the time machine.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:84%
He went back into
time, and he's there

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.100 align:middle line:84%
at the crucifixion where
they're ready to nail Jesus

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:90%
to the cross.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And he comes in and
he barges his way in.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:90%
And he had a gun.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
guns in those days.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yep.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's holding
everybody at gunpoint.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what they are.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.100 align:middle line:84%
All the Roman soldiers
are all backed off.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he said, Jesus,
you're coming back with me.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to save you.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:10%
And Christ stopped
him and said, you

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:10%
don't know what you're doing.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:10%
This needs to happen.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: That's accurate.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelief.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.420 align:middle line:90%
So time did not change for him.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.930 align:middle line:10%
>>RA EL: So if you were
to travel-- thank you

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:10%
for sharing that, by the
way, if you were to travel,

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:10%
let's say, back in time, to use
that linear sense, the moment

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:10%
you change something
there, you've

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:10%
created another
alternate timeline.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Time is like--

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
timelines to you?

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: What are timelines?

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.920 align:middle line:84%
I call them-- they're
actually time spheres.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're each at the center
of our own time sphere

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and based on where
our energy is focused

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:84%
is where the time, gravity
or the gravity flow will go.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.990 align:middle line:90%
That's what we'll experience.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.323 align:middle line:84%
But if you try to change
something happened in the past,

00:22:30.323 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
you create an
alternate timeline,

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.040 align:middle line:84%
so you can never step
in the same river twice.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:90%
So nothing is set.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Every time I move my hand, it
creates a different dynamic.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into
the ether physics.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you don't believe
in the idea of timelines?

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: No, not in how
they're shared traditionally.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever have
a déjà vu experience?

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.083 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes.

00:22:54.083 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Why does that happen?

00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:00.863 align:middle line:84%
Where you feel as if you
were there at another time.

00:23:00.863 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: If you could
zoom out right now

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and you could view us
talking, which we can do,

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.003 align:middle line:84%
you'd have-- you'd
have more information.

00:23:10.003 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
You'd have more information
because now you're zoomed out,

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:90%
you're not so focused.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So as you have more
information, you

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
can see this part, this
part and that part, right?

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And you come back into
the body, and now you're

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:90%
only at the beginning portion.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And so by the time
you get to this part,

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:84%
you remember that
you saw it before.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Because now, you've
accessed that information.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So déjà vu is what I
call a timeout slip.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:84%
You're traveling through the
ethers, picking up information.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But your focus is here
in this linear body.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And so by the time you get to
that future that you experience,

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.110 align:middle line:84%
you say, oh, I've
been here before.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you have.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.850 align:middle line:90%
You've experienced this before.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you had
a déjà vu experience

00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:00.540 align:middle line:84%
where not only do you feel as
if you've been in that situation

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:84%
before, but that you actually
know what's going to happen?

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: That is so weird.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.195 align:middle line:84%
But it's fun and
you can control it.

00:24:10.195 --> 00:24:11.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing is
you can control it.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your
brain kind of tingles

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.550 align:middle line:90%
when it happens, doesn't it?

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:90%
And do you know why?

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know what?

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I had a doctor try
to explain it to me,

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.500 align:middle line:84%
but he talked about temporal
lobe epilepsy and stuff

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:90%
And I went, no.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: No, no.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.220 align:middle line:84%
We need to go into
the ET conversation

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:84%
of this portion of
understanding it,

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:84%
which would be
everything is frequency.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.652 align:middle line:84%
So as you shift, your
brainwaves shift,

00:24:35.652 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and if you're
sensitive enough, you

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.400 align:middle line:84%
can feel that shift
in your physical body.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.995 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you can learn
how to navigate time

00:24:42.995 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:84%
by focusing on your thoughts
because your thoughts create

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.480 align:middle line:84%
a gravity well and that gravity
well condenses and becomes

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.090 align:middle line:84%
a rhythm, a standing wave that
then becomes an experience.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mentioned
earlier that you

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.380 align:middle line:84%
would have had a great time
talking to Albert Einstein.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Mm-hmm.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But had you
been able to talk

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.810 align:middle line:84%
to him about gravity, what would
you tell him about gravity?

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.745 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: He's
gotten it all wrong.

00:25:06.745 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would
tell him that?

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Yes, because
gravity is not a force.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Gravity is a flow in the ether.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Gravity is generated by
a focused consciousness

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.820 align:middle line:90%
of the source or the ether.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:25.443 align:middle line:84%
So if I imagine, if I
were to have a balloon

00:25:25.443 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
is a good example,
and I'm blowing

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.270 align:middle line:84%
into that balloon,
what happens to-- what

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.420 align:middle line:90%
happens to the balloon?

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It expands.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.348 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: It gets bigger.

00:25:31.348 --> 00:25:32.176 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:32.176 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Right?

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what does
it get bigger into?

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Into itself.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.257 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes more of itself
and it would create a torus.

00:25:38.257 --> 00:25:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like the universe.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.450 align:middle line:10%
So gravity is the
expression and focus

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:10%
of an energy that then
creates a toroidal field that

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:10%
then becomes self-generating and
self-repeating over and over.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's what planets are.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:90%
So planets do not have gravity.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:90%
They are created from gravity.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.722 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And without gravity?

00:26:00.722 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: What about it?

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's nothing.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Everything falls apart.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.613 align:middle line:90%
To some degree, yes.

00:26:07.613 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Everything would fall apart.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.197 align:middle line:84%
It would go back
to pure potential

00:26:10.197 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:84%
until an observer focuses and
it generates energy again.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you focus,
you create gravity.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does
gravity and ether relate?

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Gravity is
the flow of ether.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So the ether being
a pure potential.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.625 align:middle line:84%
Nothing's happening, but
everything's happening.

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:84%
You can manipulate the
ether through your thoughts,

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.870 align:middle line:84%
through shape, through
tone, through sound.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So as I focus in a meditating,
the ether is flowing.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Whatever I'm focusing on,
that ether starts to spiral

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and that spiral again becomes
a standing wave that then has

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.490 align:middle line:84%
frequency harmonics that
then define the thing

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm focusing on, and we
call that manifestation

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:90%
or a solid object.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.375 align:middle line:84%
This is just a materialization
of consciousness.

00:26:58.375 --> 00:26:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me
see what that is.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Crystal, right?

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Yeah, well,
it's an Andara Crystal.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.842 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this
do anything for you?

00:27:06.842 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: It depends
on who you ask.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:90%
For me, yes.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:90%
For others, maybe not.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.962 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You carry
it with you often?

00:27:11.962 --> 00:27:12.762 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:27:12.762 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I do, actually.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a great connector piece.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you get
on a plane with that?

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Mm-hmm.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to
throw some slogans your way

00:27:22.602 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:90%
and tell me about this.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.600 align:middle line:90%
What is gravitic thought?

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Gravitic thought is
what I was just describing.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:84%
The second you start
to think of something,

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:84%
you start to manipulate
and coalesce the ether

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and it creates a gravity well,
which is just a flow or--

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it's a flow in the ether.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you manifest
your own reality?

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Not only
can we, but that's

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.520 align:middle line:90%
all that's ever happening.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's so many
negative agendas coming up

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
with this eclipse,
because the powers that

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.363 align:middle line:84%
want to be or want to
pump out ideas for people

00:27:55.363 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to, because
whenever humans pay attention

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and they think
something, they start

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:84%
to generate that
gravitic thought

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:90%
and then it becomes real.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Krys, if somebody wants
to change their life totally,

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:90%
what do you recommend they do?

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.228 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Stop trying
to change their life.

00:28:12.228 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just go with the flow?

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Not necessarily go with
the flow, but recognize what is,

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.030 align:middle line:84%
accept the truth of
their current situation.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
accept things, you also

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:90%
let them go at the same time.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, you--
arises the solutions.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it
important to understand

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
the function of time,
gravity, consciousness,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.523 align:middle line:90%
and put them all together?

00:28:34.523 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: When you put
them all together,

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.070 align:middle line:84%
you get a transcendent
human species.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:43.040 align:middle line:84%
You get a species that is
mature, wise, sentient, that

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.210 align:middle line:90%
has interstellar capacity.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:49.380 align:middle line:84%
We no longer use nefarious
technologies that harm us.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:84%
We start to harmonize with
other beings in the cosmos.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.200 align:middle line:84%
We get to advance on our
journey as a collective.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When somebody comes
to you for help or advice,

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.780 align:middle line:90%
how do you start?

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.290 align:middle line:90%
What do you give them?

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: What do I give them?

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:10.910 align:middle line:84%
My first initial
thoughts about them is--

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.560 align:middle line:84%
are they able to
expand their mind?

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.488 align:middle line:84%
Are they able to
think outside of--

00:29:14.488 --> 00:29:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Outside the box?

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:16.905 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Outside
the box but also

00:29:16.905 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:84%
outside of the
contemporary thought forms,

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.010 align:middle line:90%
even in the spiritual community.

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:84%
My work is designed
for people who

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:84%
are ready to transcend
lowering thought forms.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.550 align:middle line:90%
So that's just one way.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is meditation
important to you?

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: It's the key
for me, for everything.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Different forms of meditation.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.470 align:middle line:90%
But yes, it's vitally important.

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you meditate?

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Sometimes as
I'm falling asleep,

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:90%
I could sit and meditate.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.770 align:middle line:90%
I can do qigong and meditate.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:45.940 align:middle line:90%
It can be by water.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.610 align:middle line:84%
A conversation can
be a meditation.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Music?

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Music is meditation.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I feel like my life
is a meditation.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.973 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm in a meditative
state 99% of the time.

00:29:55.973 --> 00:29:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
meditation do to you?

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: It helps to shift
the harmonics in my brain.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And if I can do that, I can
change the molecular structure

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.100 align:middle line:90%
of my body.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I control my own energy flow,
my own qi, you could say.

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And I heal myself
through meditation,

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and I can do a bunch of
other really cool things.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there other
ether physicists out there?

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: I'm sure.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they know it yet,

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.580 align:middle line:84%
but I think what I do
is one in a million

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.250 align:middle line:84%
because the contemporary
scientific world doesn't even

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.580 align:middle line:90%
believe in the ether.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I'm an
anomaly in that sense.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
discover ether physics?

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: I've studied a
lot of Dan Davidson, Viktor

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:90%
Schauberger.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.800 align:middle line:90%
I've studied Tesla.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.930 align:middle line:90%
I've studied--

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
studied from the best.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: What's that?

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
studied from the best.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.742 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes, John Kiely.

00:30:50.742 --> 00:30:52.150 align:middle line:90%
But mostly, I studied myself.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's really--
that study of self

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.640 align:middle line:84%
led to John Kiely, Viktor
Schauberger and all those guys.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trial and error?

00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Trial and error.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Wanting to know the truth.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I would go out every night
and meditate under the stars

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.380 align:middle line:90%
and ask questions.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.512 align:middle line:84%
Just say, hey, I want
to know the truth.

00:31:07.512 --> 00:31:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And something that I think
is really important that I

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:84%
need to say is this is why in
this video, listen to yourself.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.410 align:middle line:90%
They cannot control you.

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:15.100 align:middle line:90%
They cannot hurt you.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.550 align:middle line:84%
It came through the phone
because whenever a human being

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.970 align:middle line:84%
can really listen to
their inner source,

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:90%
that's where the magic is.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I call it the zero
point meditation,

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:84%
really getting to that
place of stillness

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and you create your
own gravity well,

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:90%
and you become the information.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.380 align:middle line:90%
You become the teaching.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the
most fascinating thing that

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:39.740 align:middle line:84%
has happened to you since you
started learning all this?

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Seeing how quick my
reality reflects my thoughts.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.816 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.816 --> 00:31:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even just
walking to this,

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I saw a sign that said
ascendant analytics.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.380 align:middle line:90%
I saw something about time.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So I'm seeing a direct
holographic feedback

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:03.250 align:middle line:84%
between thought and intangible
physical experience.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's
just the start of it.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working on a
few other things that

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.350 align:middle line:84%
are developing teleportation
technologies, things

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.000 align:middle line:84%
like this that have a lot
to do with how we think.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's all possible.

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
remarkable, isn't it?

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: It's the most
fun a being could ever

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:84%
have is being conscious
of what they are

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.020 align:middle line:90%
and breaking their own limits.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:90%
It's exhilarating.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:25.630 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people get
it when they talk to you?

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: No.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't understand.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:31.591 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:31.591 --> 00:32:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: I don't
think most people do.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I've had to quell a
lot of my higher--

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:41.012 align:middle line:84%
that's an awful way to
say it, but I've had to--

00:32:41.012 --> 00:32:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten really
good at speaking

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:84%
to people in code in a way
that they can comprehend

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.090 align:middle line:90%
what I'm really talking about.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So some people get
it, but most don't.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You bring it
down to their level?

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: I bring it down--

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I bring it to a space that's
digestible for their current

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.270 align:middle line:90%
perception of reality.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Because what I am is
just a gatekeeper.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I just open up the neurological
pathways for people

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:05.910 align:middle line:90%
to comprehend something else.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:09.987 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do your friends
say about your ability?

00:33:09.987 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: I've lost more
friends than I have.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll say that.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:13.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because of this?

00:33:13.795 --> 00:33:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Yeah, because I
don't fit in into any box.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't subscribe to
any spiritual path.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm a Starwalker, so I've
developed a universal framework

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:29.298 align:middle line:84%
of reality that isn't able
to just be put into a box.

00:33:29.298 --> 00:33:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of
beautiful people show up,

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.120 align:middle line:90%
though, so I will say that.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.245 align:middle line:90%
And they know who they are.

00:33:33.245 --> 00:33:34.550 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The science have
it all right or all wrong?

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: That's not
the words I would use.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I would say all controlled.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.832 align:middle line:90%
They have it all controlled.

00:33:42.832 --> 00:33:44.540 align:middle line:84%
They have it right
for whenever they want

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.800 align:middle line:90%
to use it for their benefit.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.010 align:middle line:84%
They have it wrong whenever
they want to use it

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.780 align:middle line:90%
for the freedom of humanity.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we heard your
conversation with Einstein.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.520 align:middle line:90%
What about Nikola Tesla?

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Yeah, I would
love to talk to him,

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.450 align:middle line:84%
because him and Michael
Jackson, actually.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was a tragedy.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.233 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Losing him.

00:34:05.233 --> 00:34:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yep.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:11.610 align:middle line:84%
But those level beings, those
people are advanced souls.

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:14.659 align:middle line:84%
And there's a-- do you
remember the "Twilight Zone."

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I sure do.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: One of my favorite
episodes in the "Twilight Zone,"

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.235 align:middle line:84%
I'm forgetting the title, but
there's this guy who came in.

00:34:20.235 --> 00:34:21.360 align:middle line:90%
He was an extraterrestrial.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.199 align:middle line:90%
Looked human like us.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.366 align:middle line:84%
Because most extraterrestrials
look like us, George.

00:34:24.366 --> 00:34:26.670 align:middle line:90%
They're not ETs with five heads.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Some are, but most of
them look like this.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, he has a
package he wants

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.889 align:middle line:90%
to share with this village.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And the people in the village
are yelling and screaming.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:90%
They don't like him at all.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:38.909 align:middle line:84%
Little boy comes
up and says, I want

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:40.270 align:middle line:90%
to see what's in the package.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:84%
The guy goes to show him and
one of the villagers shoots him.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So the guy's laying
on the ground

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:51.219 align:middle line:84%
and the boy opens up the
box and inside the box

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:53.058 align:middle line:90%
was the cure for cancer.

00:34:53.058 --> 00:34:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
there to help people.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Mm-hmm.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.100 align:middle line:84%
So humans have to get to
the level of consciousness

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:84%
within their own everyday life
in order to really comprehend

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.180 align:middle line:90%
the nature of reality.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.640 align:middle line:84%
They have to let go of most
of outdated scientific data

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and really start to
ask the hard questions.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.290 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:15.288 align:middle line:90%
What is ether physics?

00:35:15.288 --> 00:35:16.580 align:middle line:90%
How does reality actually work?

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.390 align:middle line:90%
How does time work?

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.430 align:middle line:90%
What is gravity?

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Not just to be
appeased, but to really

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.330 align:middle line:84%
come into a higher level of
functioning within their lives.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you
talk to Tesla about?

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: I would talk to Tesla
about privatizing his work.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So, brother, you have
a lot going for you.

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:40.040 align:middle line:90%
This is not meant for the world.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.830 align:middle line:84%
This is meant for those
who are ready for it.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And they would eat you alive
if you come out the wrong way

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.030 align:middle line:90%
with this kind of technology.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But I'd also talk to
him about teleportation

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and interdimensional travel.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Michael Jackson,
what would you say to him?

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.298 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: I would
say the same thing.

00:35:58.298 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I would actually
say thank you to him

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.530 align:middle line:84%
because I think he
knew what was going on.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he teach
you the moon dance?

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Oh, yeah, he did.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:04.350 align:middle line:90%
He taught me a lot.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:04.700 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
thank you to him,

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.720 align:middle line:84%
but I would also let
him know he's not alone

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.275 align:middle line:90%
that there's others like him.

00:36:13.275 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
could wave a crystal

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:25.178 align:middle line:84%
ball or magic wand over the
planet, what would you wish for?

00:36:25.178 --> 00:36:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: You see, that's the
thing is, I can't do that.

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Although I know I know
how to consciously,

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:35.440 align:middle line:84%
telepathically communicate
with great masses of people

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:90%
all at once.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't impose anything
because all I can do

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.570 align:middle line:84%
is offer invitation
for people because it

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.733 align:middle line:84%
has to be the planet's
decision to want to reach

00:36:45.733 --> 00:36:46.900 align:middle line:90%
a different state of being--

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the individual.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: And the individual.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't force it?

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: I can't force it.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:52.900 align:middle line:84%
People hear me and
they see this interview

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.020 align:middle line:90%
and they think it's bogus.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Then it's not for them
because there's still

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:58.810 align:middle line:84%
things I would like to
talk about that people

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:00.150 align:middle line:90%
have to be ready for.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume you
have a family at home

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:05.930 align:middle line:90%
watching you and me right now.

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Mm-hmm.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they do
to learn the things you've

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.803 align:middle line:90%
been talking about?

00:37:11.803 --> 00:37:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: What do they
do to learn the things I

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:90%
have been talking about?

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do they
get into this mode?

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Very simply put, keep it simple.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Go outside, spend time in
nature, sit by the water,

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.320 align:middle line:90%
sit under a tree.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Think about how the
tree spirals and moves.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I would offer a phrase
called notice the stillness.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you observe the clouds,
but then you feel that breeze.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.230 align:middle line:84%
But then you look at
the water, they're

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:40.260 align:middle line:90%
all moving in the same flow.

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the etheric energy
that sustains everything.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So I would suggest that
they get outside in nature

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and just observe, just
be present and let

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.240 align:middle line:90%
the sentience teach them.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.300 align:middle line:84%
They will teach themselves
through osmosis,

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.830 align:middle line:90%
through simply being.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Let go of all of the
modalities and be

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.695 align:middle line:84%
present with their
own awareness.

00:38:00.695 --> 00:38:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course,
I'm convinced

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:08.740 align:middle line:84%
this planet has been gifted
by all kinds of ET races.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.440 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned some earlier.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Where do they all come
from in terms of--

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.240 align:middle line:90%
where are they?

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: So we have a
series, not a series.

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:24.230 align:middle line:84%
We have a different groups of
ETs physically in our orbit.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:27.520 align:middle line:84%
We also have ETs who are
physically here on the planet

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.890 align:middle line:90%
that are walking amongst us.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:90%
You would not know.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.890 align:middle line:84%
We also have ETs who are
interfacing through bodies

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:36.970 align:middle line:84%
like myself speaking
from different spaces,

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:40.060 align:middle line:84%
whether you call that from
the future or the past.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.660 align:middle line:90%
So they're all over.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing, George, is
that reality is like this.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.298 align:middle line:90%
It's intermingled.

00:38:46.298 --> 00:38:48.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the ETs are
here and the humans are here.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:49.910 align:middle line:90%
It's all connected.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.770 align:middle line:84%
The thing that separates us
is our level of consciousness.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.690 align:middle line:84%
You're only going to experience
what you can perceive

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and what you think is real
because it's all here.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
mentioned the Lyrans--

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Lyrans.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On this planet.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.490 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
Pleiadians and the others?

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: So that's the thing.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the Pleiadians
are Lyrans.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.280 align:middle line:90%
They're a humanoid race.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:90%
They're a humanoid race.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So you have the Illyrians,
which are all space humans.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:84%
You have different
kinds of Reptilians.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:26.010 align:middle line:90%
You have Arcturians.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:31.060 align:middle line:90%
You have-- a bunch of beings.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.870 align:middle line:90%
There's the Irma, right?

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Which are the space
cats, not the--

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Lyrans, are not space
cats, and I know

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I keep saying that, but yeah.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have cosmic
transformative on your website.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yeah.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Cosmic Frequency.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: It's the
frequency of the cosmos.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So again-- sharing
transcendental wisdom

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.120 align:middle line:84%
through the work I do, just
offering a different frequency

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:58.920 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.925 align:middle line:84%
It would be like that
if I had a magic wand,

00:40:00.925 --> 00:40:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I would just be waving
this energy and just

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.680 align:middle line:84%
there as an invitation for
people to receive or not.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned
earlier that you've

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.970 align:middle line:84%
lost a lot of friends because
of your belief system.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:12.330 align:middle line:90%
Did you scare them?

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:13.270 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: So I don't think
it's necessarily how I am

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.290 align:middle line:84%
or how I operate as
much anything to fear.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.092 align:middle line:84%
It's more of it's
uncomfortable for people

00:40:21.092 --> 00:40:22.550 align:middle line:84%
because they're
not ready to let go

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.725 align:middle line:84%
of their own, their own thought
forms and their own ideas.

00:40:25.725 --> 00:40:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't get it?

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.558 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Yeah, I don't
think they get it.

00:40:28.558 --> 00:40:30.290 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people--

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:32.270 align:middle line:84%
want to jump ahead
before they've

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:34.425 align:middle line:90%
integrated where they're at.

00:40:34.425 --> 00:40:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll try to get to
something like understanding

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:84%
what teleportation
is, but that's

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:42.290 align:middle line:84%
not something that's just given
to a species or to a person.

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is grown and
developed within you, that you

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.110 align:middle line:84%
come to a deeper
understanding as a byproduct

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.650 align:middle line:90%
of your own consciousness.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So I think people simply don't
see the path that I've taken--

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.120 align:middle line:90%
to get here.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I've had to sit and actually
think about this stuff,

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.270 align:middle line:84%
really get serious
with myself about it.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is
memory and perception to this?

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Oh, that's
a great question.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.380 align:middle line:90%
Memory unlocks DNA.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.510 align:middle line:84%
If I remember a past
life, as some would say,

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:16.100 align:middle line:84%
which is really just a
simultaneous experience,

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I would then develop the DNA
harmonics that would give me

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:21.720 align:middle line:90%
the experience of that life.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.250 align:middle line:90%
So memory is very important.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Perception is equally
important because to a bug,

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.410 align:middle line:90%
a shoe is a great place to live.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:36.410 align:middle line:84%
A rotten shoe,
let's just say that.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.300 align:middle line:84%
To us, a human, a shoe is a
great thing to put on our foot.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.050 align:middle line:84%
So the perception
of the bug gives it

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:90%
one experience of reality.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.920 align:middle line:84%
The perception of the
human gives it another.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a believer
in reincarnation, Krys?

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: Yes, but not
in a linear sense.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.380 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In what way?

00:41:52.255 --> 00:41:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: So
reincarnation as in a--

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.370 align:middle line:90%
what's the opposite of linear?

00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:59.720 align:middle line:90%
It's happening all the time.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So you could be speaking to
a future version of yourself

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.890 align:middle line:84%
here physically
and never know it.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So time again is
not a linear thing.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.540 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a sphere.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So on the higher levels
of consciousness,

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I could incarnate and
want to be someone

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.800 align:middle line:84%
who's talking to the amazing
George Noory at Gaia.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.620 align:middle line:84%
On another experience
in my higher self,

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.520 align:middle line:84%
I could want to be a kid
walking through a grocery store.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I leave the studio, I go to the
grocery store, talk to a kid.

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Could be me.

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you hopeful for
the future of this planet?

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't hold hope, but I'm
very optimistic because I

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:40.170 align:middle line:84%
see that humans are making
the right decisions to enhance

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:43.590 align:middle line:84%
their perception, to
advance their minds,

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.070 align:middle line:90%
to learn different skills.

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:47.538 align:middle line:84%
And they're not buying a
lot of the narratives that

00:42:47.538 --> 00:42:48.580 align:middle line:90%
are being forced on them.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.380 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I think we're
on the right track.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
had many past lives?

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: I've remembered a lot
of my simultaneous experience.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How far back do you go?

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: I remember how I
got here as an Etherean,

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.570 align:middle line:90%
as I go back to the source.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:05.652 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're an ET.

00:43:05.652 --> 00:43:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Some would say that.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:07.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.190 align:middle line:90%
But an ET is--

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:12.380 align:middle line:84%
not in form, but
in consciousness.

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The level of thinking that I
have allowed myself to get to

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.392 align:middle line:84%
is one of a lot of
interstellar races.

00:43:17.392 --> 00:43:18.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why I can
talk the way I do,

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.820 align:middle line:84%
because it's not coming
from the planet's

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.340 align:middle line:84%
contemporary general
thought forms.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I'm definitely not
from here, that's for sure.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember
how you got here?

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Yes, I do.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:31.595 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spaceship?

00:43:31.595 --> 00:43:32.395 align:middle line:90%


00:43:32.395 --> 00:43:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Immersion pod.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So I-- there's these pods
on certain spaceships

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and you put your
extraterrestrial body to sleep

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and the soul is just
a pulse through them

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.450 align:middle line:84%
or it's a frequency
in the ether.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:51.490 align:middle line:84%
You can actually reroute that
frequency to a different avatar

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:90%
like in the movie "Avatar."

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: And that's what I've
done is I traversed the ethers

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and sent my soul signature to
this body to speak here now.

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.370 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I got here.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're speaking
to a group of 10,000 people,

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:84%
what's the one message you
would want them to get?

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:16.600 align:middle line:90%


00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RA EL: That it's OK to
let go and to move on.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.650 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to let go and move on.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And that could be taken
in a myriad of ways

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and that there is more humans
in the cosmos like them.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But they have to let
go of the stories

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that they've been told in
order to start to perceive

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:38.500 align:middle line:90%
that level of reality.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
people find you, Krys?

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: cosmicfrequency.org.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.490 align:middle line:10%
I'll be offering a
Cosmic Academy where

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:48.130 align:middle line:10%
they will be able to go through
a whole series of classes

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:52.310 align:middle line:10%
and then also have specialties
after those series of classes.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Instagram is cosmicfrequncy.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.030 align:middle line:84%
There's not a second "e"
in the word frequency.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And YouTube is
Cosmic Frequency 9.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Krys, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RA EL: Thank you, George.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.013 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is so heartening to
know that there's somebody out

00:45:07.013 --> 00:45:09.370 align:middle line:84%
there who cares about
the future of this planet

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and, more importantly,
the future of us.

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
