00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LAURIE MCDONALD:
As a child, I really

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.960 align:middle line:84%
did see higher vibrational,
violet-colored entity that

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.390 align:middle line:84%
called me by my
name, that guided me.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Somebody recommended
hypnotherapy--

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.760 align:middle line:84%
and was profoundly,
fundamentally changed.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:90%
I focused my mind.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I controlled my body and
looked into the eye, face

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:90%
to face with two small grays.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Are they
talking to you in that state?

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.305 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: They are.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes talking,
sometimes screaming, crying.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Screaming?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Our
scientists now tell us

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that anyone with blue eyes
has a genetic mutation.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.630 align:middle line:84%
I say more of a
genetic manipulation.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are two things
to master on the planet earth.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:90%
One is love, the other is--

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:84%

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.940 align:middle line:84%
She's the president of the

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Laurie, welcome to the program.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LAURIE MCDONALD:
Thank you, George.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.273 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in hypnotherapy?

00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:18.423 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen to you?

00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: I had
been considering

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:10%
being a psychologist.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:10%
It had been pointed out to me
that I could be a psychiatrist.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:10%
I had some issues
from my own childhood,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:10%
and somebody recommended
hypnotherapy.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I went and did a session and
was profoundly, fundamentally

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:10%
And I realized in
that moment that you

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:10%
can talk for 10 years about
something that's bothering you

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:10%
and it might be all logical
and makes sense to you,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:10%
but the emotion of the impact
of the situation is illogical.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And to work from the
foundation in the subconscious

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:90%
creates a rapid, whole healing.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In the session you
did, were you the hypnotherapist

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.570 align:middle line:10%
or were you the patient?

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I was the subject--

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:90%
patient.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And healed
and marveled at it

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and knew right then and there
that the whole picture was

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:84%
working with the
depths of the mind,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.860 align:middle line:84%
not just the trauma part
that was articulating

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.413 align:middle line:90%
their situation.

00:02:16.413 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is
hypnotherapy different

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:90%
from general hypnosis?

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Hypnotherapy
is-- because we're

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:84%
looking to age to propagate
health and wholeness,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
we want to look for
inner child healing.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, for other hypnosis, say,
we're doing a clinical session

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and somebody wants to lose
weight or to stop smoking,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:84%
then we're healing them
on a different level.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.000 align:middle line:10%
We're doing more
behavioral modification

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.647 align:middle line:10%
in that type of hypnosis.

00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, do you
have any special traits

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
or gifts in addition to the
practice of hypnotherapy?

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Such as?

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I mean,
are you perceptive?

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Are you intuitive?

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: After so many
years, about 25 years,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:10%
I always say like a little
prayer or affirmation prior

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:10%
to a session to ensure
that I'm giving everything,

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:10%
that I'm totally in tune and
holding their energy so that I

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:10%
can speak the most effectively
and articulate the words that

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:10%
are going to allow
this person to drop

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:10%
into the alpha brainwave
and become receptive

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:10%
and open for an
exploration of their mind

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:10%
or their experiences.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:10%
So I'm intuitive.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You have wired
up patients before

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.058 align:middle line:10%
and have monitored their
brainwaves, haven't you?

00:03:39.058 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: That's right.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:10%
When you're hooked
up to an EEG, we're

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:10%
able to watch as the subject is
moved from the beta brainwave,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:10%
the one we're
communicating in now,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:10%
dropped down into the alpha.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:84%
We bring them all the
way down to the delta.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to go too
deep because then they're

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
almost asleep, and it's
hard for me to hear them.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now,
that's a good point.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But are they talking
to you in that state?

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: They are-- sometimes
talking, sometimes screaming,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:90%
crying.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Screaming?

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.655 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: It's very
important that we

00:04:11.655 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:10%
create some form of a
barrier so that if they're

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:10%
reliving a traumatic experience,
such as alien abduction,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:10%
that they can adjust
their perception of it

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:10%
to view the memory as opposed
to relive it because it's

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.427 align:middle line:10%
extremely traumatic.

00:04:28.427 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in the alien abduction

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:90%
end of this?

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, I'm
a lifelong experiencer.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Personally, OK.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But
here's the thing.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I didn't consider
myself any different.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.838 align:middle line:84%
I figured that everyone was
having some form of experience.

00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everyone
was having contact.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And my contact
wasn't necessarily

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:84%
with what was overtly
or obviously what would

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.610 align:middle line:90%
be deemed an extraterrestrial.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:84%
As a child, I really did
see higher vibrational,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:84%
sort of violet-colored entity
that called me by my name, that

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:90%
was loving, and that guided me.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was when I was
about six that I woke--

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not your imagination?

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: [CHUCKLES] No.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I woke up and looked
out my bedroom window,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and I saw two gray
aliens with my brother.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And I went to knock on the
window to get their attention,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and that same violet one told
me to take one step back.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, they told me
to lay down and to go to sleep,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:90%
and I did.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And funny, when
I was about 32, I

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.430 align:middle line:84%
was having a
traumatic experience.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:10%
I was trapped in some
sleep paralysis stage,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:10%
and I was feeling pain.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:10%
But to the right of me, I
heard my name being called,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:10%
and it was the same
sort of violet entity.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally
had the ability

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
to consciously move my attention
to them, they said two words.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:90%
They said, "focus and control."

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:90%
And I did both.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:90%
I focused my mind.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:90%
I controlled my body.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I sat up and looked
into the eye, face to face,

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:84%
eye to eye contact
with two small grays.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was calm,
feeling psychologically

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:84%
prepared for the
situation, thinking

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
that I might be greatly
informed in this moment.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed that they tilted
their head to each other,

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
just ever so slightly, as if
they didn't know what to do.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.070 align:middle line:10%
And it seemed like
just instantaneously,

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.530 align:middle line:10%
a taller gray appeared.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was still quite
calm, quite cool.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed its
energy was perturbed,

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:90%
and it advanced towards me.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:10%
And its head and felt or
appeared somewhat claw-like,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:10%
and it had about
a 12-inch needle,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:10%
looked like a chopstick.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, geez.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And that's
when I became afraid.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:10%
And I leaned back
and pulled my knee in

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:10%
to do like a kind of
a reverse roundhouse

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:10%
kick into the side of the
head, and I whited out

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:10%
and lost consciousness.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But in the morning, I was
still suffering from the pain.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they injected you?

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: Well, I tore my
abdominal muscles fighting

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:10%
and had to have
surgery, herniated them,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:10%
had to have a mesh
implant put in.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.325 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: So I don't think
that they're very friendly.

00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
lucky they didn't

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:90%
do something horrible to you.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I think they did
enough things horrible to me

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:84%
During that time, a lot that
was happening in the phenomena

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.890 align:middle line:84%
itself was the
hybridization program,

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and I intuitively feel
that that was their intent.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.030 align:middle line:10%
I think that what they were
there to do was extract ovum.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Even at that age?

00:07:59.320 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: 32.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 32.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, that's true.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Please, George.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What?

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.170 align:middle line:84%
They were coming at you
since you were what, six?

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, I've seen the
gray ones less than other ones

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:90%
that were higher vibrational.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:17.890 align:middle line:10%
Any time, now at my age, I
can sense which ones, what

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:10%
their intentions are.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:10%
They're all agenda-oriented.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:10%
There's about six
abductor races,

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:10%
and several other
ones that come.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.110 align:middle line:90%
They're agenda-oriented.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Once we understand
the agenda, get

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.680 align:middle line:84%
to know the players
in the game--

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: You begin
to learn the rules,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:10%
and you can deflect
specific energies

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:10%
or decide not to engage.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:84%
I simply don't
engage with anything

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't show respect
or, basically, love.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.140 align:middle line:84%
If they're not open
and loving, then I

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:84%
have no desire to communicate
because they're self-serving.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Other
than your brother,

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:84%
did your family have
any kind of experience--

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:90%
your mother or your father?

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:10%
In 1939, my
grandmother on the farm

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:10%
said she came out of the
house with a basket of laundry

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:10%
hooked on her hip.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:84%
She went around to hang it
and saw over the corn fields--

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:84%
it was after harvest
time then; corn was low--

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and there was a UFO hovering.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:10%
And she stared at
it, and she said

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:10%
she was mindful to
hold on to the laundry

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.710 align:middle line:10%
because she didn't want
to have to wash it again

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:10%
in an old wringer washer.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:90%
And so she held tight to it.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, you were
worried about the laundry?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And she said she watched it
wobble, seemingly wobble,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:90%
and then shoot out of sight.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And she held that memory until
I questioned her about it

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.953 align:middle line:90%
in my 30s.

00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laurie, you had
an interesting relationship

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:90%
with your mother.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what happened.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.190 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: So as I found
out when I turned 50,

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:04.230 align:middle line:10%
I just did a small TV show
on the abduction phenomena

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:10%
and got a phone
call after it aired.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, Laurie,
this is your mother.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a mother.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.942 align:middle line:84%
And she's like,
this is your mother.

00:10:13.942 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did she abandon you?

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: She did.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:10%
And she said it
was very important.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.460 align:middle line:10%
After her watching
the show, she sees

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.070 align:middle line:10%
that I run this
California's largest support

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:10%
group for experiencers--

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:10%
president of a
non-profit organization

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:10%
that deals with that subject.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:38.100 align:middle line:84%
She said that during the
time that she was pregnant,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.280 align:middle line:84%
she had been visited
multiple times, almost

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.480 align:middle line:90%
like once a month.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:10%
They would take
her aboard a craft,

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:10%
examined her, all
the time telling her

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.000 align:middle line:10%
that not to be afraid, that
their interest was only

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:10%
in her baby.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you had no idea
this was going on at that time?

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Never knew this
until I was 50, after years

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:90%
of being in the field.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.460 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: So she had said
that the morning I was born,

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:10%
she had gone out early
to sit in a lawn chair--

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:10%
it was September--

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:10%
and two small entities
appeared on either side of her.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.320 align:middle line:84%
When I asked her
to describe them,

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:84%
she describes something to
me that sounded like a Zeta,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
not like a gray, although
the height was similar.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:84%
She said she moved forward
through the apple orchard

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.340 align:middle line:90%
into the clearing--

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.330 align:middle line:84%
clearings where they turned the
tractor during harvest time.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And above that was a UFO,
and she was instantaneously

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.830 align:middle line:90%
upon it.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Her first thought was it was
much bigger on the inside

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
than on the outside of
this particular craft.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.205 align:middle line:84%
And her feet were cold because
the floor felt metal-like.

00:11:42.205 --> 00:11:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And they had laid her on
a table that she described

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:84%
looked like an
ironing board that

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:90%
shows you the era she's from.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classic.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And again, I
told her multiple times

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:84%
when she would get scared that
it was only about the baby.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
She said she heard
a loud popping sound

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
towards the end of it in her
head, near her nasal passage.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And then she later woke up
on the lawn near the house,

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
bleeding both vaginally
and from the nose.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:10%
She was calling out for
help, and there was nobody

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:10%
there because the whole
household was somehow sedated.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you never
knew this as a kid?

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Never.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:90%
No, no because--

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.655 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] the neighbors
took her to the hospital,

00:12:21.655 --> 00:12:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and I was born that
morning at 9 o'clock.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.800 align:middle line:84%
My parents have black
hair and brown eyes.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:90%
My mom's about 5'1".

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:90%
My dad, not much taller.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.485 align:middle line:10%
I am not.

00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did
you get your height?

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I have no idea.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't look like them.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And she had a very hard
time bonding with me.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:84%
It reminded her
of her abductions.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
She had gone to the
doctor and told them

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.330 align:middle line:90%
about what was happening.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:90%
They said it was hormonal.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:84%
He sent her to a therapist,
and the therapist eventually

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:84%
told her, you know, just shut
it down because you sound crazy

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and you risk losing
your other children.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So she shut up, and
she kept a journal.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:90%
And later--

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: When
I was 50, she said

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:84%
that she would give me
the journals so that I

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:84%
could see what had
happened to her

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and why she couldn't keep me.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:84%
It was very difficult. She
couldn't breastfeed me.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.160 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't eat.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't eat any milk.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.583 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So she gave
you up as a baby?

00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: She gave me
away to different relatives

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and bounced me around and
then eventually put me up

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:90%
for adoption.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:90%
But I was never adopted.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you know of her
as your mother at any point?

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: No.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:90%
She never mothered me ever.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't even recognize
her on the street

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:84%
if I saw her until
she talked to me.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And she said if there is a
support group like you run back

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
then, maybe things would
have been different,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't have
felt so scared.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is she still alive now?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: She is.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So a few years back, about
five years now maybe,

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I was going to do another
TV show with Jim O'Connell,

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.980 align:middle line:90%
a show called "Experiencers."

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, well, how
about we bring my mom on and let

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
her experience that
very specific freedom

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:84%
of speaking the
truth without fear

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.627 align:middle line:90%
and let her tell her story.

00:14:16.627 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And he thought
that that was a great idea.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:84%
But then he talked to her
all summer-- honestly,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:90%
he knew her better than me--

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and what happened was I
got a call from Canada

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:33.367 align:middle line:84%
saying that my mother had just
suffered a brain aneurysm--

00:14:33.367 --> 00:14:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD:
-followed by a stroke

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and to get back to Canada
as soon as possible.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And I did, and she survived
but was unable to speak.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't speak any longer.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, geez.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: Her neural
pathways have been distorted,

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:10%
and the words in her mind
were not the words coming out

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:10%
of her mouth.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:10%
And that was a weird
timing, very unusual.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And then not a week
later, Jim O'Connell--

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:84%
the headline in the
online newspaper

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:84%
said, UFO experiencer and TV
host Jim O'Connell suddenly

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:90%
passed away in his sleep.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: And he was
gone, and that was that--

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:10%
just like that.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All these
people around you

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
that had some kind of influence,
directly or indirectly,

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.220 align:middle line:90%
were gone.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yes.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:90%
My mom survived, though.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, a couple of
years later, she still

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
struggles with speech,
but I brought her

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.853 align:middle line:84%
to a conference I was doing
in Detroit and let her.

00:15:41.853 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's my hometown.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.825 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, I grew up in Windsor.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:45.863 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:15:45.863 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: She's there now.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Windsor is a great spot.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:90%
I used to go there a lot.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Do you continue to
have these experiences?

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I do, actually,
but they're different now.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Now I feel that my
consciousness has expanded

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and I no longer look at
the phenomena the same way.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that any interaction
with a UFO or an alien

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:84%
isn't so much about
them, that it's more

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:90%
about the human experience.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:10%
It sort of knocked on the
door of my consciousness

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:24.300 align:middle line:10%
and allowed me to see that I
was more than what I thought

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:10%
and that it opened the door
to multi-dimensionality,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:10%
that the soul itself
is multidimensional.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And I came to some conclusions
that some of the hybridization

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:84%
programs, and particularly
with the gray human,

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:42.300 align:middle line:84%
were to hijack our ascension,
to hijack our ability

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.860 align:middle line:84%
to move through space
and time without a body.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:10%
And because I've had so many
out-of-body experiences--

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.030 align:middle line:10%
I've been a meditator
for over 40 years.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I've had out-of-body
experiences.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I spent five years
at a Buddhist temple,

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:84%
learned more about
extraterrestrials

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:84%
and other worlds in the
thousand cases that I've worked.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But I went there
initially because I

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.420 align:middle line:84%
was continuously having
an out-of-body experience.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:84%
Every time I'd relax, I'd
pop right out of my body,

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.650 align:middle line:90%
and I could see me.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:90%
And so what did that tell me?

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:84%
It told me that I was still
Laurie without the vessel.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a chance to
interview author Ron Felber

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.780 align:middle line:84%
of the Mojave abduction--
that's his book--

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and he talked about
that incredible case.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.282 align:middle line:10%
- So they're
experimenting with them.

00:17:30.282 --> 00:17:33.847 align:middle line:10%
Did they ever physically
take them somewhere?

00:17:33.847 --> 00:17:39.722 align:middle line:10%
- Well, these experiments
went on for hours.

00:17:39.722 --> 00:17:40.522 align:middle line:10%
- Emotional.

00:17:40.522 --> 00:17:42.863 align:middle line:10%
Emotional is what
I would call them.

00:17:42.863 --> 00:17:44.280 align:middle line:10%
- And as I mentioned,
they thought

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:10%
they were going to
have a heart attack.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.250 align:middle line:10%
And so when they would
get so worked up,

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.742 align:middle line:10%
praying and literally
pinching one another--

00:17:53.742 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:10%
and this is the
kind of detail that

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:10%
makes it so incredible to
me, pinching one another--

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:10%
what do you see?

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:10%
What do you see?

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:10%
Describe this to me.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is exactly
what people would do.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:10%
And so when they felt they were
on the verge of either going

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:10%
mad or dying physically,
a mist would come in,

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.625 align:middle line:10%
and it would calm
them, like anesthesia.

00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:17.500 align:middle line:10%
- Like a spray, yeah?

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah, like a mist would
just cloud into the camper,

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:10%
and it would calm them.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:10%
And it was almost like
scientists keeping,

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, animals
alive for experimentation.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.270 align:middle line:10%
We don't want them
to die because we

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:10%
need to do more experiments.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:10%
- Wow.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:10%
- And so they were
kept purposefully

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:10%
from having heart
attacks or from going.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:10%
- Keeping them calm.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:10%
- Exactly, which I
found quite incredible.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:10%
But they do wind
up on the craft.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.770 align:middle line:10%
But they do wind
up on the craft.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.780 align:middle line:10%
They wake up with no memory
of being on the craft,

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:10%
and it was recovered
retrogressively.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:10%
- Do they know if it
took them anywhere

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:10%
or if they just were
carried along the craft?

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.550 align:middle line:10%
- I'm telling you, it's
another interesting aspect

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.700 align:middle line:10%
of the story.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:06.008 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned this sort of
triangular mining searcher

00:19:06.008 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:10%
they called it that the--

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:10%
- The crown was separate
from the bigger craft, right?

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:10%
- Correct.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:10%
But he came out of
the bigger craft.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:10%
- OK.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:10%
- And they felt the
ground rumbling.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:10%
They felt the ground
vibrating beneath them.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.210 align:middle line:10%
And they felt the camper
ultimately being lifted up.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.405 align:middle line:10%
The entire-- like the
ground didn't change.

00:19:25.405 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:10%
- Sucked it right in?

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.490 align:middle line:10%
- Yes, everything-- the
horizon, everything.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:10%
- That happens.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.090 align:middle line:10%
- They felt a very cool--

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:10%
everything got cold, and
the rest is blank to them

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:10%
and, again, was recovered
through retrogressive hypnosis

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.885 align:middle line:10%
by Dr. William Anixter in
Asheville, North Carolina.

00:19:41.885 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was quite
an abduction case.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But as you have said, there are
different kinds of abductions.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:10%
So physical abduction,
you're going

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:10%
to find that is maybe
mantis, reptilian.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they're more into
psychological abduction.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
consciousness extraction

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:84%
from the body where
they just move that,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.350 align:middle line:90%
and that's a different form.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:84%
There's about five
different types of abduction

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.620 align:middle line:84%
that have been reported to me
over the last 25 or 30 years.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.927 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some friendly,
some not, right?

00:20:16.927 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: You know,
most of the abduction,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:90%
by nature, is not friendly.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:90%
It's self-serving.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:10%
They're not doing it for us.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:90%
They're doing it for them.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:90%
They don't call us by our name.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:84%
They don't show
a lot of respect.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:34.420 align:middle line:84%
They keep us calm
for them, not for us.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And knowing who
to interact with,

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.570 align:middle line:90%
it's a big universe we live in.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple M
class, star planets,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.780 align:middle line:84%
the red dwarf star systems
that we look at now.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
There are four or five
stars around every star

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.450 align:middle line:84%
that we can see that have
a longer, slower wave.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Those planets could possibly
be habitable by some

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:90%
of these extraterrestrials.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Some also are inter-dimensional.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:10%
But above all that,
there is another form

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:10%
of being that is a beautiful,
unconditional, loving entity

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.310 align:middle line:10%
where I learned
many of the things

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:10%
that I teach in some of
the retreats that I do.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:90%
A lot of it is on being human--

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.680 align:middle line:84%
what the definition of
the word "human" is.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks it means
"people" or "person."

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:90%
And, in fact, it does not.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:84%
"Hue" is the word we
use to measure the depth

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.710 align:middle line:90%
or saturation of light.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:10%
"Man" comes from the
word "manifestation"--

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:10%
to come into the physical
or to be embodied.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.090 align:middle line:90%
A "hue-man" is a light and body.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Being race and gender are
subcategories of that.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And once we know
what we are, we're

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:84%
far better at answering some of
the larger, more philosophical

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.470 align:middle line:84%
questions that the
humans have been

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.420 align:middle line:90%
pondering for a millennium.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:10%
When you know what you are,
you have an understanding

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:10%
between fate and destiny--

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.670 align:middle line:10%
fate or the circumstances of
your life, but not your life.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:90%
We have an opportunity to grow.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.000 align:middle line:84%
The whole phenomena teaches us
about consciousness expansion.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.330 align:middle line:84%
What we really are and
why we're having this

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:90%
has nothing to do with the ETs.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:90%
They're simply using us.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say that most
of your hypnotherapy practice

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
is based around
abduction cases or not?

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It's about 50-50.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I do a ton of deep trauma,
emotional work, inner child

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:84%
work, help people
find their potential,

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:84%
allowing them to be what
they're supposed to be.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:84%
But America and many other
countries, the people

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:90%
are the walking wounded.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:90%
They're hurt.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.090 align:middle line:90%
They've suffered.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:84%
They're not free
to express them.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Their outside self and
their other personality,

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.830 align:middle line:84%
their true self or spiritual
self, is different.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:10%
And so we're always
projecting who we are

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.090 align:middle line:10%
or what we are to other people,
and it's not necessarily

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:10%
our entire truth.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But through the progression
of hypnotherapy,

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:84%
the integration
of the whole self,

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:90%
one becomes self-actualized.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When these
individuals come to you

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and they think
they've been abducted,

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:23.810 align:middle line:84%
how did they start
the conversation?

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:90%
What did they say?

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It's not easy, you
know, depending on how vocal

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:84%
they've been or who they've
been allowed to speak with

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.590 align:middle line:90%
or who's accepting of them.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:10%
But for the most part,
it's very difficult.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Strange things have happened.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I did a case study on
one man who was straight,

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:84%
ended up becoming homosexual,
then straight, and then

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:90%
homosexual again--

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
all the time having quite
scary psychological--

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
of his abductions?

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.722 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, that's
actually a common thing.

00:23:53.722 --> 00:23:56.990 align:middle line:10%
There are many commonalities
among different experiencers.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.330 align:middle line:10%
These commonalities
help indicate

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:10%
what race is abducting them.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.000 align:middle line:84%
When we know who, we're
better able to understanding.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I kind of like to
psychologically

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
profile specific races
so that we know how

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.990 align:middle line:90%
to behave in their presence.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So reptilians are
very regimented.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:10%
All we have to do is be just as
regimented and owning our power

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:10%
and being our true self,
basically exhibiting no fear.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia program
"Truth Hunter," Linda Moulton

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Howe had a chance
to talk with a man

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:33.230 align:middle line:84%
who talked about
these abduction cases

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:84%

friendly or not.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:40.670 align:middle line:10%
- Did you see any humanoids
of any shape or size or type

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.950 align:middle line:10%
in any of your dreams?

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:10%
- Yes, ma'am.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:90%
- Which type?

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:84%
- Oh, skin similar to ours--
however, grayish in color--

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:84%
elongated heads, larger
sockets for eyes, larger eyes.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:90%
And during that, I was seeing--

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:84%
there was one about
where my feet would be,

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and I could see expressionless
face as a little bit worried

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:90%
but was trying to keep me calm.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:84%
- Did you get the
telepathic impressions

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:17.660 align:middle line:84%
of warning there aren't enough
of us, there's more of them?

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.120 align:middle line:10%
Something is going to
happen that's going

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:10%
to be a big problem?

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.430 align:middle line:10%
And that these beings
have been trying to help

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:10%
and now they can't because
they don't have enough numbers

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.720 align:middle line:10%
versus what is there?

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:10%
- Similar perhaps.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:10%
But I think it's more along
the lines of what we're

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:10%
doing that's going to harm us,
such as sending signals out

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:45.590 align:middle line:10%
into space is not a safe thing
to do, that we have technology

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:10%
that we need to expand
on but it's being kept

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:10%
from everyone behind locked
doors or closed doors

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:10%
but only to certain individuals
or something to that effect

00:25:55.530 --> 00:26:00.440 align:middle line:10%
and allow all minds to come
together to get things done

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.590 align:middle line:10%

It's a garden planet in a

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials
that are coming here

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:90%
who people are saying--

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't have clients come
to me and say, oh, they

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.470 align:middle line:84%
told me we're overpopulated,
and we have to do--

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't listen to that.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.660 align:middle line:10%
That's-- I've heard
that since the '50s.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe that
channeled information at all.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's another
form of manipulation.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:10%
And really, I think
that they're coming here

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:48.380 align:middle line:10%
for their own selfish needs.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Just like about
10,000 years ago,

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:84%
when the Anunnaki
came from Nibiru,

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:84%
they are originally
gathering gold to spray

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.450 align:middle line:84%
into their atmosphere to
create a stabilization.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:10%
We spray heavy metals
into ours right now

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:10%
to create another form of
stabilization for our planet.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not exactly the
healthiest thing.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.080 align:middle line:84%
But in certain
circumstances, there

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:20.930 align:middle line:84%
is what you would consider
collateral damage.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:24.240 align:middle line:10%
Their coming-- some
things are created--

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:10%
or terra form to
move into the planet.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if that's
the case either.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.400 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on
which ones are coming.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:10%
So when the Anunnaki came,
they created a type of being,

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:10%
which I think is us.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Right now or right then,
about 10,000 years ago,

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:84%
the indigenous
people of the planet

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:90%
had black hair and brown eyes.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.070 align:middle line:90%
All indigenous cultures--

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like me.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yes, had
black hair and brown eyes.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:54.033 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki brought the
blond hair, blue eyes.

00:27:54.033 --> 00:27:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Nordic-looking.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: The Nordic-looking
into this being.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Our scientists now tell us
that anyone with blue eyes

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.720 align:middle line:90%
has a genetic mutation.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I say more of a
genetic manipulation

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.100 align:middle line:90%
because it's through that form--

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.267 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have blue eyes.

00:28:11.267 --> 00:28:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I do.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so all
blue-eyed people then

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:90%
are related, if it's a mutation.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a manipulation.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's when we began to see
some changes on the planet.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's why they came.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:10%
They came to take our
gold, liked what they saw,

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.670 align:middle line:10%
thought they could
manipulate, and stayed.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Others come to harvest genetics.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
our junk DNA holds

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:84%
multiple strands of other
extraterrestrial DNA

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.410 align:middle line:90%
and they just harvest from us.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:48.110 align:middle line:10%
But at this point, in our
personal and soul evolution,

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.770 align:middle line:10%
we're waking up to
the fact that we are

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:10%
more than what we think we are.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.400 align:middle line:10%
And because we are a
multi-dimensional entity,

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:10%
we need to begin to
grow up a little bit

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.060 align:middle line:10%
and stop exhibiting fear.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are two things
to master on the planet earth.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.790 align:middle line:90%
One is love; the other is fear.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Both are dualistic in nature as
this is the planet of duality.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And in that learning, we gain
personal empowerment back

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:84%
to that self-actualization
of living and learning

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.702 align:middle line:90%
what we're supposed to be.

00:29:23.702 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much
of that has to do

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:84%
with the ability

It's everything.

All roads lead to consciousness.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.970 align:middle line:10%
Once you see that,
then that consciousness

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:10%
can begin to expand.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:40.100 align:middle line:84%
When we peel away the
limitations of culture

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.960 align:middle line:84%

begin to see the true self.

>>MCDONALD: Well, I mean, when
I do past life regression work,

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm always surprised
when I see people

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.732 align:middle line:10%
find historical reference to
the past life that they had.

>>NOORY: Do you believe them?

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well,
when they are naming

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:07.730 align:middle line:84%
places and dates and then later
we do a little bit of research

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and find that there
was a town named that

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.905 align:middle line:84%
and there are records
of a birth name of that.

00:30:12.905 --> 00:30:15.140 align:middle line:84%

could have studied that.

have studied that,

I don't need them to

They don't need
to come, you know.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:10%
- So I would say to people that
feel the need to self-identify

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.580 align:middle line:10%
with a label--

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.760 align:middle line:10%
like I say, getting
smaller and smaller.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.680 align:middle line:10%
Why do you need to define
yourself in that way?

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.200 align:middle line:10%
Why do you need a label?

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Why can you not
just be what you are

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and say, this is how I
live my life, and live it.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:19.930 align:middle line:10%
But it's this need to create
a construct with which

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:10%
to self-identify,
which I call a label.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:31.860 align:middle line:10%
And the totality of these
labels, I call phantom self.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:10%
Phantom self because
it is an illusory self.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.470 align:middle line:10%
It is the construction
of a self identity,

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:10%
which is nothing more than
a series of experiences.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.160 align:middle line:10%
And so what we've
been manipulated to do

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:10%
is self-identify
with what we are

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:59.170 align:middle line:10%
experiencing instead of the "I"
which is having the experience.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.690 align:middle line:10%


00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.760 align:middle line:10%
And so then you've got
all these phantom selves,

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.093 align:middle line:10%
and you play these phantom
selves off against each other

00:32:06.093 --> 00:32:11.020 align:middle line:10%
and, oh, yes, will run the show.

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:16.930 align:middle line:10%
And the greatest
of all religions--

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:24.450 align:middle line:10%
the religion that basically
like spawns the others,

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:30.110 align:middle line:10%
but it's the religion, the
greatest religion, in my view,

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.690 align:middle line:10%
of human society--

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:10%
it's the religion of "I am
a," the religion of "I am a."

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.530 align:middle line:10%
And it has its own mantra, and
it goes like this, (CHANTING)

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:10%
"I am a, I am a."

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:50.460 align:middle line:10%
And it plays out
like this, (CHANTING)

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:55.740 align:middle line:10%
I am a (STOPS CHANTING)
man, woman, Black, white,

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:10%
this religion, that religion,
this sexuality, that sexuality.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.250 align:middle line:10%
"I am a."

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:10%
And what it's saying is, I
am a label or set of labels.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.410 align:middle line:10%
"I am a" finds himself.

Kind of what he's

00:33:19.155 --> 00:33:20.322 align:middle line:90%
So the psyche of the human--

00:33:20.322 --> 00:33:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, interpret that.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It's made up of
different aspects of the self.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.030 align:middle line:90%
We have the inner child.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:27.128 align:middle line:90%
We have an inner rebel.

00:33:27.128 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:84%
The person that all of a
sudden decides, you know what,

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.490 align:middle line:84%
screw this, that's
your inner rebel.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.950 align:middle line:84%
We have an inner judge, that
voice in the back of your mind

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:84%
saying, maybe you
shouldn't do that.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So we have all these
different aspects of the self.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the
"I am" energy, I

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.780 align:middle line:84%
think that St. Germain
started to bring that.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Interesting good.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.930 align:middle line:84%
It'll give you a sense
of part of the self,

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.765 align:middle line:84%
but all of those aspects,
phantom selves are,

00:33:50.765 --> 00:33:53.780 align:middle line:84%
need to be integrated
into the whole self.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's not so much "I am."

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.690 align:middle line:84%
It gets to the point where
you are empowered in it.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:90%
"So say I."

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.970 align:middle line:90%
And with that, you are creating.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:84%
You are co-creating
your world, your life,

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking
steps to move forward.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.960 align:middle line:90%
"So say I" and "I am."

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.800 align:middle line:90%
I am this.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.600 align:middle line:90%
I am that.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.735 align:middle line:84%

say I," I am creating.

>>MCDONALD: It depends.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.145 align:middle line:84%
I hear-- I read a lot,
and people are saying,

00:35:07.145 --> 00:35:09.020 align:middle line:84%
oh, they have post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.300 align:middle line:84%
PTSD is from a single

That's why you have it.

What they're suffering from is
post-abduction stress disorder

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.500 align:middle line:90%
because it's ambiguous.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.550 align:middle line:90%
You're unsure.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.370 align:middle line:90%
You're afraid.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Is it real?

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Was I dreaming?

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And the person creates

I'm not exactly
the same that way.

eye-to-eye contact,

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.460 align:middle line:90%
I was psychologically prepared.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I thought about it.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Before, I was doing
field research.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I had cameras set
up on the outskirts.

>>MCDONALD: It's evolved.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.940 align:middle line:84%
The grays don't show
up quite as much.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have learned
how to shut that energy down

and to disengage.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:40.270 align:middle line:10%
So everything is energy, so
it resonates or harmonic.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:42.890 align:middle line:84%
You have to resonate with
it in order to see it.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:50.850 align:middle line:10%
trueyouhypnotherapy.com.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.990 align:middle line:10%
They follow me on
Twitter @lauriestrueyou.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Or I have a clinic in Sacramento
treating hypnotherapy.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often are
you seeing patients?

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, I have
a full-time practice

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.930 align:middle line:90%
and have 25 years.

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they come
to you, primarily?

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: They come all
over the world to Sacramento.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes feel
a little bit bad.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.640 align:middle line:84%
They're coming from beautiful
vacation destinations

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.925 align:middle line:84%
to stay in Sacramento for a
week or so worth of sessions.

00:37:19.925 --> 00:37:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
age ranges of patients?

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I have
done children.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.150 align:middle line:10%
I had a case study
from a 7-year-old

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.630 align:middle line:10%
until she was 28, an abductee.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:35.480 align:middle line:10%
And to the very old, I did
an older fellow for vice,

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.200 align:middle line:10%
and we regressed him
on camera because it

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.350 align:middle line:10%
was on his bucket list.

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: He wanted
to know he is--

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.660 align:middle line:84%
what most people
didn't know about

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.670 align:middle line:84%
that session was when he came to
me, it was because he's dying,

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and he needed to
know before he died.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.690 align:middle line:84%
He needed to get
into those memories.

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He wanted answers.

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And he needed
to make some sense of it

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:56.930 align:middle line:90%
and get the answers.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:57.380 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, we all do.

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Laurie, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: You know
it's my pleasure.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, George.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:02.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's right.

00:38:02.995 --> 00:38:05.990 align:middle line:84%
We do all need answers, and
hypnotherapy may very well

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:08.060 align:middle line:90%
be the one way to do that.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.260 align:middle line:90%
Have we been abducted?

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.400 align:middle line:10%
Have we not?

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.140 align:middle line:10%
But at least we can
get some answers.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.820 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
