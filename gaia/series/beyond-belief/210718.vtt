00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.765 align:middle line:10%
You know, every once in
a while in your life,

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:25.770 align:middle line:10%
comes an individual, who has
a profound effect on yourself,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.770 align:middle line:10%
such as the case with
Dr. Art Rosengarten,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:10%
a psychotherapist
and tarot expert.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
He has been studying and reading
the tarot cards for the past 40

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
years and has
taught, researched,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:84%
lectured, and written books on
the tarot, as well as published

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.527 align:middle line:84%
his own tarot deck, which
is absolutely fascinating.

00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Art, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ART ROSENGARTEN:
Thank you, George.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.285 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be here.

00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.868 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: I've
been wonderful.

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These tarot cards, when
you first introduced them to me

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:90%
about 30 years ago--

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe it's
been that long--

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:90%
you taught me a lot.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Good.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:10%
Well, the tarot is a
wonderful teacher of us all.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:10%
And one of the great
early tarot, I guess,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:10%
metaphysical scholars
of the 19th century

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.790 align:middle line:10%
said that tarot is a book that
informs by making one think.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: True.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSENGARTEN: And I would add,
it informs by making one think

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:10%
and also intuit
because it really is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:10%
a tool that opens up intuition.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far back does
the tarot card go, Art?

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: About
600, 700 years.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:84%
First made its presence
in Renaissance Italy,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and as far as where it
originally comes from,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:90%
it remains a mystery.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:84%
It definitely has roots
in ancient Western mystery

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:84%
schools, but I think
the first designer

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:84%
of tarot, which
is a big question

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
in the tarot community,
I think it all goes back

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.600 align:middle line:90%
to the deep human imagination.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:84%
It came out of somebody's
collective unconscious.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was tarot, once,
originally like a parlor game?

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Well, yes.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, originally, it was used
in the court as a parlor game

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and as an interesting
set of cards

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
that the nobility
like to play with.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:84%
It didn't really become
more of a metaphysical tool

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
for about several hundred
years, when it moved to France.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And the French saw a
tremendous metaphysical layers

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.957 align:middle line:90%
of meaning in the tarot deck.

00:03:03.957 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many cards
in a deck are there?

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: 78 cards now.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:90%
And think of it as two decks.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.840 align:middle line:84%
There's the Minor Arcana,
which is like playing

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:90%
cards, standard playing cards--

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:90%
four suits and court cards.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
In the tarot, there are
an additional court card,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.680 align:middle line:90%
the knights.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:90%
So instead of 52 cards, it's 56.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's an
additional 22 cards,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:90%
which are the higher keys.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And these, you could think of
as the universal archetypes

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:90%
that are in the deep psyche.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does every card
have its own meaning,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
or is it done with a
combination of cards?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Every card has
its own discrete non-redundant

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:90%
meaning.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So there is some overlap, but
each card has its own spectrum

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:90%
of possibility.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like, the
death card, for example,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:84%
when you pull that,
does that mean

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:90%
the person is going to die?

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: No.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:84%
It means that death is part of
the universal reality of life

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and death, and death can be
understood on many levels.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Death could represent change,
metamorphosis, transformation,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:84%
dissolution, the end of
a cycle, for instance,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:90%
or physical death.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.820 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the context.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, a lot
of times, with tarot--

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I've
learned from you--

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:84%
it has a profound
effect on people.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:84%
But in many cases, you
pick the card for them,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
especially when
we do radio shows.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, in person,
they pick their own card.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Is there a difference there?

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: That's
a good question.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:90%
My experience is, not really.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:90%
It's almost secondary.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
However, in person,
when I allow a person

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.430 align:middle line:84%
to select their own
cards, they tend

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:84%
to take greater
ownership of the reading

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.867 align:middle line:84%
and can't point their fingers
and say, you picked the card.

00:05:32.867 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did it.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Yeah, you did it.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it's
irrelevant, in my opinion,

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.160 align:middle line:90%
who picks the cards.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:05:41.035 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some
pictures of tarot cards,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and you can explain to
us what we're looking at.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.460 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSENGARTEN:
Well, on the right

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:10%
there, you see the High
Priestess is a tarot card

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:10%
from the Aquarian tarot.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, understand
that there are maybe

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
600 or 700 different
published tarot decks, which

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.070 align:middle line:84%
display different artists
interpretations and executions

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:84%
of these symbols, but
there's only one tarot.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
There's one tarot, but many
different artistic renditions

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Versions of it.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Tarot cards
are essentially oracles.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:84%
If you were to ask
a great wise person,

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:90%
say Carl Jung, why does tarot--

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:90%
why does tarot work?

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Why does the I-ching, the
Chinese book of changes,

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:90%
why does it work?

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, it works
because it's an oracle.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And what oracles do
psychologically is,

00:06:53.990 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
they translate in a problem or
a question into a dream image,

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:84%
into a symbol, in
a dream language.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So they take it out of
the ordinary reality,

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and they move it into
more of an imaginal realm.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.730 align:middle line:84%
They take the thing
that's out of it

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:90%
and turn it into a symbol.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:84%
They also point to the unseen,
the things that are outside

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:90%
of our field of awareness.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:84%
They show possibilities
which are filtered out

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:90%
in our thinking.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
a favorite tarot card?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Well,
I have several.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I have several, and it's
hard to pick just one,

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.260 align:middle line:90%
and it depends on the deck.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:02.820 align:middle line:84%
But I think the card that, I
think, I'm really drawn to,

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:84%
as you asked me this question,
is the temperance card

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's about
blending opposites

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:90%
in a very creative way.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like working with
opposites and feeling

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:90%
the synergy between opposites.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the hermit
card because you like that too.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Yeah, well,
the hermit is the number nine.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Nine is a very special
number in the tarot.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.919 align:middle line:84%
The hermit-- today, we
would think of the hermit

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:39.610 align:middle line:84%
as representing individuation
or self-realization,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and it has a sense of
being very determined

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and tenacious at climbing that
mountaintop to realization

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.565 align:middle line:84%
without caring too much about
what other people think.

00:08:56.565 --> 00:08:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
let's look at what

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Theresa Bullard
thinks and get me

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.375 align:middle line:90%
your reaction to what she says.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.750 align:middle line:10%
>>THERESA BULLARD: So next,
we come on the hero's journey

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.660 align:middle line:10%
to meet the hermit,
and this is our guide

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.300 align:middle line:10%
that helps to shine
a light upon our path

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:10%
and illuminate the way.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
This guide may take on the
form of another person, who

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:84%
embodies wisdom and offers
us some sage advice,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.180 align:middle line:84%
or it may be our own inner
teacher or higher self

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:84%
that we meet through
deep meditation

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:90%
and time of solitude.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The hermit teaches us that
by going inward and knowing

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, we can come to know
the source and, from there,

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.030 align:middle line:90%
understand the universe.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
The hermetic principle
of correspondence

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:84%
tells us, as the
inner, so the outer.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, the numerology associated
with the hermit is number nine,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and nine is the end of the
numerical series of 1 to 9.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So nine is the
culmination of everything

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:90%
that has gone on before it.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:90%
It's the completion of a cycle.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to the end
of one stage, the descent,

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and we're about to begin a
new stage, at the turning

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:84%
point, which is then
followed by an ascension.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:10%
And so, nine represents
the conclusion,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:10%
and it ties together all
the different key elements,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:10%
the lessons, the
insights that have been

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:10%
gained from the previous cycle.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, with this ending, there
are some weighty aspects

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.700 align:middle line:10%
that come with nine, and
these are balanced, though,

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:10%
by the fool, which
is zero, which is

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:10%
the gateway to any new cycle.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And that zero represents the
youthful appreciation for life,

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:90%
and it never grows old.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:84%
But the hermit, on the
other hand, is the end.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:90%
It's like the ancient of days.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
It's the part of us that's
experienced and wisened.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's the aspects
of our consciousness

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
that can be very old
and yet very wise.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.480 align:middle line:84%
He is the culmination of
all the fool's experiences

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.118 align:middle line:84%
in the first nine
steps of this journey.

00:11:01.118 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what did you
think of what she just said?

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Very well stated.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I agree with
everything she said.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.092 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
fascinating, tarot cards.

00:11:10.092 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I've got a friend of
mine in Saint Louis.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.820 align:middle line:84%
She just started taking up
the tarot card as readings,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and she does a little
YouTube channel.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And she shuffles the
deck and picks the card

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:90%
that pops out of the deck.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of weird, but
can anybody learn this?

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN:
Anybody can learn it,

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:84%
but it requires serious study,
and practice, and a teacher.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:90%
There's a tendency to freelance.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:84%
People have a lot of ideas,
and they may be intuitive.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And they may jump in without
getting enough, I think,

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.110 align:middle line:84%
of the proper training
and study of tarot.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:90%
But anybody can study and learn.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:84%
When I was a graduate
student in psychology,

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
one of the tools that
require time to learn

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:90%
was the Rorschach test, right?

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And just to master giving a
Rorschach and interpreting it,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:84%
it really would take
about, at least,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:84%
a term of graduate school to
really practice and know it.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I think, if a person put
that focus on the tarot,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:84%
they could learn the tarot
in about four months, maybe.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not bad.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.770 align:middle line:84%
But they need a
teacher like you,

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Art, to tell them the
difference between what's right

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:90%
and what's wrong.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Absolutely.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:90%
They need a qualified teacher.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference between a
tarotist and a psychic reader,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And a true tarotist is
not necessarily psychic.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:84%
They're intuitive,
but they're more

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:90%
diviners than psychic readers.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.800 align:middle line:84%
They believe in the
process of divination.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And interpretation.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: And
interpretation.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, psychic readers, some
are brilliant psychics.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
know the tarot very well,

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
but they can use it
as a springboard.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.110 align:middle line:84%
They look at some
details in a card,

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and that opens a lot of
psychic associations for them.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.110 align:middle line:84%
But they don't necessarily
know the deck of tarot the way

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:90%
a tarotist might.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Art, what
is vision logic?

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Vision logic is
a next level of consciousness

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:84%
above normal thinking, which
occurs when a person does

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:90%
a lot of intuitive work.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:90%
They may be in therapy.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:90%
They may following their dreams.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:84%
They may do things
like this, and there's

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:84%
a shift in the way
we think, where

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:84%
ordinary thinking starts moving
into seeing, visually, ideas.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
at this vision logic, still,

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:90%
and you can highlight it for us.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: So when a person
shifts into vision logic,

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:84%
synchronistic things
happen all the time.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.520 align:middle line:84%
There's always
synchronicity going on

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:84%
because they're looking for
things colorizing together,

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%
things that gather together.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:84%
It opens up the
intuitive, which is--

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Intuition is the perception
that sees possibilities

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And so, there's almost an
organic natural evolution

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness to this
next stage of vision logic,

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:84%
where we become
much more intuitive,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and the visual sense supersedes
the cognitive logical way

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that we tend to
process information.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:24.415 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you
interested in tarot cards, Art?

00:15:24.415 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Well, I
was in graduate school

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:84%
at the Institute of Asian
Studies in San Francisco,

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
studying Buddhist and
Jungian psychology.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And I took a weekend
workshop on the tarot cards

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:84%
taught by a philosophy
professor of Indian philosophy.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.943 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just because?

00:15:44.943 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Because it
seemed really interesting.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.970 align:middle line:84%
How do Western tarot cards
fit into a Eastern thinking

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:90%
and Jungian thinking?

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:90%
And it was fascinating.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Seeing these cards and
these pictures were actually

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
illustrating what
different levels

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.910 align:middle line:84%
of psychological and
spiritual experience that we

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:90%
read about and talk about.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:15.530 align:middle line:84%
They were beautiful markers
of psychological experience.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And so, I got very
excited about it.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And I started
studying it in depth

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and ended up writing my doctoral
dissertation on the tarot,

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
in comparison to dream
analysis and projective

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
storytelling, which is the
thematic apperception Test.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
It's another well known
psychological tool

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:45.190 align:middle line:84%
to see if tarot cards, the
tarot reading is total magic.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.803 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's happening by a
random shuffling of the cards.

00:16:49.803 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It has
spontaneity to it.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.345 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Spontaneity.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And could a technique
like this be,

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.300 align:middle line:84%
at least, as consistent and
valid, reliable and valid

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.069 align:middle line:84%
as some of these other more
accepted psychological methods

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:90%
and tools?

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very elaborate
interesting study.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And yes, in fact, I saw
that the tarot readings

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:84%
could be on the same
footing as a dream analysis.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:84%
The difference being that
it came into being, really,

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:32.547 align:middle line:84%
in a totally acausal, you
could say, magical source.

00:17:32.547 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Fascinating.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you used
to pick on the radio,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.007 align:middle line:84%
I think you picked three
cards per person, right?

00:17:39.007 --> 00:17:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Yeah.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you use them all or
you just pick one of the three?

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: No, I
would shuffle, spread.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd pick all three
cards, and I'd

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:84%
read them in a spread very
short, quick spread there.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Normally, when I
do a full reading,

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
if somebody contacts me,
I'll do an 11-card reading,

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and that takes about an hour.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But in that context, a
three-card reading or even

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:84%
a five-card reading, which
is a little bit more--

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intense.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: --can be
done in about five minutes.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the rainbow
realm of consciousness, Art?

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:20.340 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Well, I
call it rainbow realm

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:10%
because like a rainbow, which
just appears, and it's serene,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:10%
and it's colorful, and
it's somewhat magical,

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:10%
and it can be seen by
multiple observers,

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.530 align:middle line:10%
and then it just
dissolves and disappears.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
a tarot reading is.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:90%
It's like out of nothing.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
these cards appear,

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and we have this experience
that can be very powerful,

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.950 align:middle line:90%
but it's very transitional.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:90%
It's very temporary.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, it is over,
and it dissolves.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think the realm of, say,
divination is a rainbow realm.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.538 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Consciousness plays a
part of this too, doesn't it?

00:19:10.538 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Well, of course.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything
is consciousness.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
various stages

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness with this?

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Well, I
think, tools like the tarot

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.380 align:middle line:84%
shift us out of our normal
dualistic way of thinking,

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:90%
a normal adult thinking.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And like I was saying,
we start moving

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:40.900 align:middle line:84%
into more intuitive perception
through vision logic, which

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.523 align:middle line:84%
is a doorway to higher
levels of consciousness.

00:19:44.523 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
these higher realms

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:51.800 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness from the
yogic perspective is important.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.590 align:middle line:10%
>>YOGI AMANDEEP: There are seven
dimensions of consciousness,

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:10%
which are known as
sepat bhumika, seven

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:10%
dimensions of consciousness.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Then, consciousness
shifts from one dimension

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:90%
to the other dimension.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:13.490 align:middle line:84%
There's an in-between
point, a twilight zone.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:84%
That space is known
as stori, which

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:90%
means glimpse of the truth.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Before the sun rises,
you see the rays.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:84%
The sun is not out yet,
but you see the rays.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.035 align:middle line:90%
That is known as satori.

00:20:28.035 --> 00:20:31.670 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:37.190 align:middle line:84%
First is self-realization, and
then comes cosmic realization,

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:90%
universal realization.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:90%
There is dynamism happening.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:84%
There is creativity happening
in your consciousness,

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:90%
but it is not through thought.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it is not the human
mind, which is creating it.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.220 align:middle line:84%
It is a global,
conscious mind, what

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.110 align:middle line:84%
we call the mind of God, which
is there to manifest that.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So through the meditation,
you start listening to God,

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.010 align:middle line:84%
for the lack of a better
word, because God, ultimately,

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:90%
is a word.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
There is ultimately
not being who

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.940 align:middle line:84%
is sitting there saying, I
am God because that would

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.010 align:middle line:90%
be very egotistical, you see?

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So that being, that which
cannot be destroyed,

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that which cannot be named,
that which cannot be defined,

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:17.225 align:middle line:84%
that which is ultimately
understandable to that eyeball.

00:21:17.225 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that the
sages of the Indian traditions

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
of the Yogic traditions,
of the Buddhist traditions,

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and, indeed, of Christian
mysticism, Jewish mysticism,

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:84%
they all paint a picture
of these different realms.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And they call them angelic
realms, or subtle realms,

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.020 align:middle line:90%
or God realms.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're realms
that we enter,

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.503 align:middle line:84%
as our consciousness becomes
more and more subtle.

00:21:49.503 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>YOGI AMANDEEP: You
start having access

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:90%
to what we call satyajit ananda.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.040 align:middle line:84%
More and more access
to such brilliance,

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.020 align:middle line:90%
consciousness ananda.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.840 align:middle line:84%
From that, purpose,
natural purpose arises.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to fight
or struggle for it.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.160 align:middle line:90%
You see, it is inclusive.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:90%
It is serviceable.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, it will
uplift you, and it

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:90%
will uplift anybody it touches.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that echo some
of the things you teach?

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Absolutely.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I like
about the tarot is,

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:84%
the tarot is not a direct ticket
to the non-dual, ultimate state

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
of advanced layers
of consciousness.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a transitional phase from
ordinary everyday thinking

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:41.880 align:middle line:84%
to beginning on the path to
shift the way we perceive.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And the tarot
operates in a way that

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
opens our intuition
and our imagination.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what is
very important in our culture

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:55.470 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a jump to
the top of the mountain.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:07.860 align:middle line:84%
We need to transition,
transform our way of processing

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:13.610 align:middle line:90%
to begin to be more spiritual.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And the tarot is a
good transition place.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about
the tarot cards that

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:90%
make things so accurate?

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Well, I think
it's the process of divination.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
One is, we start
with the motivation

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.250 align:middle line:90%
to know more than we know.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a great motivation.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Then, the process of preparing
for a reading, in a way,

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.040 align:middle line:84%
creates an altered
state of consciousness.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Just shuffling the
cards and selecting

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:84%
starts to shift the
way we normally think.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're asked, when
you come to a tarot reading,

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:84%
to suspend disbelief
for the moment

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and let's see what the
tarot oracle shows us.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.100 align:middle line:84%
All of these
preliminaries, in a way

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:84%
are setting the table
right for synchronicities

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:90%
to occur and to have impact.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And once we then
apply what I call,

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:22.670 align:middle line:84%
George, the prime directive
of all tarot card reading,

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and the prime directive is
the card is always right.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is, isn't it?

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:30.905 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN:
It's always right.

00:24:30.905 --> 00:24:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us to
shift our thinking

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:42.760 align:middle line:84%
until we can feel what it's
saying, where it is right.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a shift in our normal
way of linear way of thinking,

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that we accept, as given,
that there are no accidents.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:84%
This card is there
for us now, and we

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:84%
need to embrace it and see
what our associations, what we

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.475 align:middle line:90%
can learn from it.

00:25:03.475 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many different
possibilities are there

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.080 align:middle line:90%
with all the cards of events?

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Well, a
full tarot card reading,

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
say, of 10 cards or 11
cards, is such a rare event,

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:27.170 align:middle line:84%
that for those cards to come
fall in the same positions,

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.860 align:middle line:84%
again, exactly in the
same positions, the odds,

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:84%
by chance of that happening
are in the trillions to one.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.825 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: In
the trillions to one.

00:25:37.825 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a snowflake.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:84%
A tarot card reading
is a rare event

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.240 align:middle line:84%
that has its own natural beauty,
and symmetry, and uniqueness.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.007 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's why
they're so fascinating.

00:25:50.007 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a still
here, Art, I want you to see.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And tell us what
we're looking at here.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Do these echo most of the
cards that are in a tarot deck?

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN:
Yeah, Raider-Waite

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.810 align:middle line:84%
was published in
1909 by Arthur Waite,

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:84%
the great English
occultist and scholar.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And this deck, the Rider-Waite
has become the standard tarot

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:90%
deck of the modern age.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough, George,

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:84%
the images here were all done
by a young American artist.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Waite was British.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:37.940 align:middle line:84%
But a young American artist
named Pamela Coleman-Smith.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:90%
She's 22.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:43.130 align:middle line:84%
She's brought to London because
she was a surreal artist.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:84%
She's an imaginal
artist, and she

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
drew these images, which
most serious tarotists today,

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:54.090 align:middle line:84%
still use the Raider-Waite
because it's a perfect tarot

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:54.890 align:middle line:90%
deck.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What brought the
tarot card into the modern age?

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: I think
when it moved to France,

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and Elephas Levi or Levi was
one of the great champions

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.110 align:middle line:90%
of the tarot cards.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It got picked up in
Europe by intellectuals,

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:84%
who were really interested
in Western metaphysics.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And it drew a lot of
the great intellectuals

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:31.340 align:middle line:84%
when it particularly
when it moved to England,

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.550 align:middle line:84%
like George Bernard
Shaw and Aleister

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Crowley, people like that.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And it drew a lot of
people at the turn

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.310 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century
in the beginning, who

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:50.930 align:middle line:84%
became very fascinated with that
Theasophie, and spiritualism,

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:90%
and these types of movements.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And from there, in the 20th
century, it migrated to the US

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.650 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And there are the great
relevance of Jungian

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and humanistic psychology
started in the '60s basically

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:84%
saw a natural resonance
with the tarot deck.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's when
I learned the tarot.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So it took more of a
psychological turn,

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:84%
psychospiritual turn, starting
in the '60s until now.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tarot seems to be
very interested these days.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.070 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be on the uptick.

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.400 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: I think popular
culture, today, is now--

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.760 align:middle line:84%
it's a whole new world with
this younger generation.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are segments
that are now bringing it

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:90%
into the information age.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Though, I'm not clear
that it's on the uptick.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a dumbed down
popularization of the tarot.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:13.870 align:middle line:84%
But serious study
of the tarot, it

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:17.680 align:middle line:84%
remains to be seen if the
younger generations are

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:84%
going to take it on the way,
say, our generation did.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Gaia News went
out to find out that question.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: OK.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Tarot and oracle decks
for divination are the best

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Sellers.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:84%
US Game Systems, a leading
publisher of tarot cards,

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.110 align:middle line:84%
tells the Financial
Times, they've

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.840 align:middle line:84%
had to double their print
runs in the past year

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.360 align:middle line:90%
because they sell out so fast.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not just tarot.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
The "New York Times"
reports data from Yelp,

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:84%
showing searches for
supernatural readings

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:90%
more than doubled in April.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Why are so many people
turning to these methods now?

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:10%
Mitch Horowitz, author
of "The Seeker's

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.538 align:middle line:10%
Guide to the Secret Teachings
of All Ages" explains.

00:30:05.538 --> 00:30:07.830 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ: People are
interested because there's

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.120 align:middle line:10%
truth in these things.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.620 align:middle line:10%
They discover truth
in these things,

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.430 align:middle line:10%
just like they discover truth
in therapy, and in philosophy,

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.090 align:middle line:10%
and in spirituality.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So people gravitate to
things, where there's

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:90%
some sense of discovery.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout history, people
have sought their own path

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:84%
to self-discovery and healing,
especially during times

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.913 align:middle line:90%
of uncertainty.

00:30:29.913 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
important to keep

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:84%
in mind that the occult and
the esoteric are evergreens.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:84%
They're a permanent fixture of
our culture and our society.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.370 align:middle line:84%
There does seem to be
an uptick of interest

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:90%
during periods of crisis.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, during
the Civil War,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.200 align:middle line:84%
there was an uptick of
interest in spiritualism,.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.030 align:middle line:84%
The same was true during World
War I. During World War II,

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.220 align:middle line:84%
sales of the Ouija
board doubled.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So when people are
anxious, they seek

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.260 align:middle line:84%
to avail themselves of
insight, whether it's

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.380 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, or therapeutic,
or occult in nature.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The act of tarot reading
is the ultimate do-it-yourself

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.770 align:middle line:84%
entry into the
esoteric teachings.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Some believe there is a
form of channeled energy

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.720 align:middle line:90%
from the cards.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I perform
tarot readings myself,

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:90%
mostly in private.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I ask myself the question,
is there anything here,

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.890 align:middle line:90%
or is this just a Rorschach?

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Is this just a random draw?

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
a possibility

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.870 align:middle line:84%
that certain divinity
pictograms or tools, like tarot

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.360 align:middle line:84%
or the I-Ching,
they may represent

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:84%
a kind of frozen snapshot
in time that gives us

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.390 align:middle line:84%
a sense of everything that's
going on all around us

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:90%
at a given moment.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:84%
If one accepts that time
itself, linear time,

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
is really just an
illusion, we've

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:47.170 align:middle line:84%
been able to prove that to
ourselves in various ways.

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And hence, tarot
seems to give us

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:53.560 align:middle line:84%
a broader perspective on what's
going on than we normally

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.713 align:middle line:90%
have access to.

00:31:54.713 --> 00:31:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's pretty
dramatic, isn't it?

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.422 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Well said.

00:31:57.422 --> 00:32:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I agree with a lot
of what he said.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:06.220 align:middle line:84%
One thing he talked about is
the Rorschach, mentioning like,

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:10.330 align:middle line:84%
is this just an inkblot
that we project whatever we

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:13.120 align:middle line:90%
want to project or see in it?

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
that a tarot card

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:19.960 align:middle line:84%
is different than a
Rorschach because it

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:84%
does have a projective level,
and that's the first level.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:27.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll show a card and say, well,
what's this card saying to you?

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.130 align:middle line:90%
What comes up for you?

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:29.650 align:middle line:90%
What do you see in this card?

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:33.130 align:middle line:84%
But the tarot also
has a second level,

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and it has meaning
from its own side.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So you might say, well,
I think this card is

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.650 align:middle line:84%
all about what I'm doing here
and what I'm thinking here.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, OK,
that's important.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.330 align:middle line:90%
And we can talk more about that.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you a little
bit about that this tarot

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:84%
card means from its own
side in terms of, say,

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:00.100 align:middle line:84%
500 years of
scholarship and study

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.600 align:middle line:84%
by leading commentators
and scholars of the tarot.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, together, we
will try to find a click.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So what I call,
saying, oh, OK, now I

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.320 align:middle line:90%
know where that's at for me.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm a psychologist.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.587 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That helps you.

00:33:21.587 --> 00:33:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: It
helps me personally.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:27.220 align:middle line:84%
But I've always been
about, hey, this

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.310 align:middle line:84%
is a tool that
professional psychologists,

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and social workers,
and therapists,

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and psychiatrists ought
to avail themselves of.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And here, we get into a
little bit more controversy

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.180 align:middle line:84%
because the medical
establishment

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:50.650 align:middle line:84%
has their own lock
on what they see

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:54.730 align:middle line:84%
as acceptable, valid,
ethical practices.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So they misunderstand
how the tarot

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:84%
might be used as a supplemental
tool in a wide range

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:06.160 align:middle line:90%
of therapeutic tools.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.300 align:middle line:84%
For instance, they
may do dream work.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.449 align:middle line:84%
The tarot is maybe more
effective than dream work.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:16.449 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of tools
and psychotherapy

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:17.800 align:middle line:90%
that are accepted.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.210 align:middle line:84%
But when we come to
these tarot cards,

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.690 align:middle line:84%
the tarot carries a
lot of shadow content.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, I've been on the edge of
trying to take out the Woo Woo

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:84%
quality of it and
say, look, this

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.770 align:middle line:84%
is about symbols
and synchronicity.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And tarot cards tend to
show the bigger picture,

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:84%
and that's what my
patients basically say.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:53.350 align:middle line:84%
But they have to
be used skillfully

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:57.670 align:middle line:90%
within the context of therapy.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.310 align:middle line:90%
That's my orientation to it.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does tarot
tie into divination?

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Well,
divination is the method

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:12.550 align:middle line:90%
that sets a tarot reading up.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:90%
That's what a tarot reading is.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Divination is blind selection.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:25.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the preparation of
a reading that sets up

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:84%
the mood, that is
blind selection

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:32.740 align:middle line:90%
from a large set of unknowns.

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, there is supreme
focus on what arises momentarily

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:51.040 align:middle line:84%
in the present moment in
a card and the invitation

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:57.280 align:middle line:84%
to associate to it and to feel
and to take a look at what that

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.120 align:middle line:90%
is saying to you right now.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's how tarot
readings are divination.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Carl Jung, the
psychiatrist, dealt with tarot?

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Interesting.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung was
really very involved

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:19.270 align:middle line:84%
with the I-Ching the Chinese
divination divination tool.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:24.580 align:middle line:84%
He only makes one mention in
his collected works of the tarot

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.310 align:middle line:84%
because he never really got
around to it, because he

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:90%
was doing so many things.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But what Jung says
in his writings is,

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:40.630 align:middle line:84%
it seems that the tarot
deck captures the archetypes

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:90%
of transformation.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
how Jung would see it,

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.560 align:middle line:84%
that the symbols of
the Major Arcana.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.900 align:middle line:84%
in particular, are a special
set of universal archetypal

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.880 align:middle line:90%
realities that we all have.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're a special set of
archetypes of transformation

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:03.650 align:middle line:90%
to higher human consciousness.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So those hierarchies are really
images of higher potentialities

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:90%
of the human mind.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about intuition?

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come in?

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Intuition
is the function

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:84%
that allows us spontaneously
to perceive possibilities

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:27.800 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you enter in
to a divinatory process,

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.680 align:middle line:90%
it invites intuition.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.600 align:middle line:84%
The imagery is the
language of intuition--

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:90%
images, pictures.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.210 align:middle line:84%
When we relate
directly to a picture,

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and we apprehend, which
means, we relate to it

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.430 align:middle line:90%
without interpreting it.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:38:00.120 align:middle line:84%
We just feel it
until we get a click.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Then, we can offer
an interpretation.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:10.300 align:middle line:84%
That is actually the
vehicle to the intuitive.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you to
do a reading for me, Art.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And through the
magic of television,

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.360 align:middle line:84%
we will make your
tarot cards appear.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:17.993 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: I am.

00:38:17.993 --> 00:38:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1, 2, 3.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.698 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
give me a reading.

00:38:22.698 --> 00:38:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: All right.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.157 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
say, what do we do?

00:38:25.157 --> 00:38:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: OK, so now,
here, we have two decks.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:31.410 align:middle line:84%
This is my deck,
tarot of nine paths.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I use this for deeper,
more spiritual questions.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the Raider-Waite
deck, the full 78

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.040 align:middle line:84%
cards of the Raider-Waite,
which we talked about.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.340 align:middle line:84%
This we do for more,
what we might call,

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.850 align:middle line:84%
domestic questions about
your life, what to do,

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.510 align:middle line:90%
what's happening in the world.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So I would ask you, do you
have a question, George?

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
a life question?

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: It can be a
domestic or an essential deeper

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.430 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.140 align:middle line:84%
It can be about you
personally, or can it

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.975 align:middle line:90%
be about anything else.

00:39:05.975 --> 00:39:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
let's talk-- let's

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:09.578 align:middle line:84%
do one about this country,
the United States.

00:39:09.578 --> 00:39:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Very good.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People seem to
be sad, depressed, angry.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Will we get out of that mess?

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Great question.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I would say, let's
use this deck,

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.470 align:middle line:84%
and we'll do the
three-card reading, OK?

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: OK.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
ask you, when I'm

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:34.640 align:middle line:84%
going to give you the
instruction of selecting

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:38.180 align:middle line:84%
the cards, you're going to
pull it and not turn it over.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:84%
You're just going
to hand it to me--

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Down?

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Down.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So the first card, we're
talking about America.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, this card is what
the way it appears now.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:52.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, we'll put that right here.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:58.565 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: And the next
card is, what's really going on.

00:39:58.565 --> 00:40:02.613 align:middle line:90%


00:40:02.613 --> 00:40:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: OK.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, the third card
is what we need now.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.050 align:middle line:90%


00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:18.207 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to remove this
other deck, so we can now--

00:40:18.207 --> 00:40:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want these
shuffled together, or can they--

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.415 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Yeah, we
can remove that, too.

00:40:22.415 --> 00:40:25.490 align:middle line:84%
We'll just look at
these three cards, OK?

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:29.000 align:middle line:90%
And America, right?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.800 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:38.560 align:middle line:10%
And so, the first card
that we chose for this

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:44.090 align:middle line:10%
is the way America appears
now in terms of what's

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.620 align:middle line:10%
going on with our time.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:51.335 align:middle line:84%
And so, the card that we
got, George, is the lovers.

00:40:51.335 --> 00:40:54.090 align:middle line:90%


00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.900 align:middle line:10%
That seems
counterintuitive in a way,

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:04.460 align:middle line:10%
which is an agent of union, OK?

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.723 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way I would interpret
that, given the question

00:41:07.723 --> 00:41:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and given what
we're talking about

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:19.180 align:middle line:84%
is, the American union, right
now, got a real problem.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.680 align:middle line:90%
We've got a real problem.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:25.300 align:middle line:10%
And America, in principle,
was formed, we could say,

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.370 align:middle line:10%
on the principle of
the lovers, which

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:32.530 align:middle line:10%
is a union of opposites and
inclusion, in a way, I think,

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.510 align:middle line:10%
that's in our Constitution.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.170 align:middle line:90%
That's in our basis.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So now, you ask the question,
what's going on with America?

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's saying,
well, it appears

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:51.280 align:middle line:84%
that the issue of the Union, of
the nation is what's going on.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Split apart.

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN:
It's falling apart.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.390 align:middle line:90%
But that's how it appears.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's really
going on right now?

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The magician.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.140 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Which
is an agent of--

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A sleight
of hand is happening.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:06.630 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSENGARTEN: What's that?

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:08.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A sleight of
hand that's happening.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: No, not
sleight of hand in tarot.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:17.810 align:middle line:84%
The magician is about
visualization, focus,

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:19.950 align:middle line:90%
intention.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And my belief is
that that's part

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:38.100 align:middle line:84%
of the problem is that America
is not united in its intention.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:44.410 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what we're
shooting for in a united way.

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And so, we can't use the
magician, where there's

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:51.300 align:middle line:84%
so much talent in this
country and potential

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.890 align:middle line:84%
to create new things,
to magically bring

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.850 align:middle line:84%
about the types of
radical changes,

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I think, are called for right
now because we're divided.

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think what's really
going on is, we could say,

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.920 align:middle line:84%
we're needing to use
our creative magician

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to solve the really challenging
problems that probably

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.530 align:middle line:84%
are related to,
we're not united,

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.690 align:middle line:90%
but we're based on united.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Our Constitution is
about one nation,

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.800 align:middle line:90%
and it's polarized tremendously.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And the polarization
is blocking our ability

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:44.870 align:middle line:84%
to use our imagination, our
visualization, our intention

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:49.310 align:middle line:84%
of the magician to really
deal with the serious issues

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:50.690 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's how I would
work with these question,

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.650 align:middle line:90%
these cards.

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:02.925 align:middle line:84%
Now, the final position
here is what we need now.

00:44:02.925 --> 00:44:05.830 align:middle line:90%


00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And here, this is
the judgment card--

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Awakening.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:16.810 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSENGARTEN: --and it's
an agent of awakening.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time, the call, the
final judgment, the decision,

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:28.610 align:middle line:90%
the decision.

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:35.760 align:middle line:84%
We need to wake up now
and act as one nation.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or?

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.190 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:43.022 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a fourth card
will tell us that?

00:44:43.022 --> 00:44:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Why don't
we pick from this deck

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:45.880 align:middle line:90%
for the fourth card?

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let
you pick it, George.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:49.070 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or the one card.

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:57.051 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: --one card, you
put it right in front of you.

00:44:57.051 --> 00:44:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A chariot.

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: OK.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
that mean, Art?

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.710 align:middle line:10%
The chariot is the quest--

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:14.510 align:middle line:10%
the quest and the challenge.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And the chariot travels
across the skies,

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:27.560 align:middle line:84%
across a wide expanse, bringing
teachings of higher wisdom.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:33.650 align:middle line:84%
The chariot is carrying the
Holy Grail in the chariot.

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So there's hope for us?

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSENGARTEN: I think the
higher teachings, the higher

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:42.590 align:middle line:84%
wisdom, which is
always about love.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It's always about higher
universal love, which

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:53.880 align:middle line:84%
unites the whole world, there
is hope for that message

00:45:53.880 --> 00:46:00.340 align:middle line:90%
to arise to manifest.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Without it, there's a
lot of hopelessness.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:11.740 align:middle line:84%
We need something
that large and deep

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:16.810 align:middle line:84%
because the polarization,
the lack of union

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:23.260 align:middle line:84%
is blocking our ability for
the creative problem solving

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.820 align:middle line:90%
of the magician.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we need.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.820 align:middle line:10%
We need to use our,
I'm going to say,

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:36.270 align:middle line:10%
magical powers to
solve major problems.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking magical
problems using creative problem

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:43.900 align:middle line:90%
solving, visualizing.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Art, how do
people get a hold of you?

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.450 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Go to my website,
moonlightcounseling.com.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:51.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Simple.

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:52.270 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSENGARTEN: Simple.

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And they can set up
a reading with me

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.205 align:middle line:84%
or a counseling session,
whatever they like.

00:46:57.205 --> 00:46:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:46:59.080 --> 00:46:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSENGARTEN: My pleasure.

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:00.463 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure seeing you.

00:47:00.463 --> 00:47:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Always a
pleasure seeing you.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:07.070 align:middle line:10%
The tarot card, they
determine your future.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.810 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:14.000 align:middle line:90%
