00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.290 align:middle line:10%
You know, the intent of this
program is not to scare you.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.850 align:middle line:10%
But you're going to get a
little chilled on this program

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:10%
today with my guest Ron Felber.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Ron has written a
number of books.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:90%
He's a former deputy sheriff.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.820 align:middle line:84%
He has a PhD from
Drew University,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and is the author of
an incredible book

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:84%
called "The Mojave
Incident, A Chilling

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Story of Alien Abduction."

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Ron, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RON FELBER: Good to be here.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
an amazing story.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:84%
How did you come
across it first of all?

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:10%
>>FELBER: You know, I
was involved in business,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.840 align:middle line:10%
so I had a sales force that was
pretty extensive at one time

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:10%
and spanned the country.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I was on the
East Coast, and I

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:84%
hired a fellow named Paul Moran,
who was on the West Coast.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:90%
We became good friends.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And through business, I would
go out there on business,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.629 align:middle line:90%
we'd have a dinner or so.

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:14.170 align:middle line:84%
We got to know each
other well enough

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that he confided in
me about a friend who

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:90%
had had this experience.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to share it,
but he knew I was a writer.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And to put the two
of us together,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:84%
he thought two credible
people he could trust

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and could trust each
other, and so the story

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.420 align:middle line:90%
evolved from there.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you a
UFOlogist at all before this?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: No.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really like
people my age generally,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with "The Twilight
Zone" and Rod Serling,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and just loved
that kind of story.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.472 align:middle line:84%
And I was a writer, so
I admired his writing

00:01:47.472 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and I admired many of
the science fiction

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.410 align:middle line:90%
writers, HG Wells, et cetera.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But as far as actually
being involved

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:84%
in UFOs from a nonfiction,
reality point of view, no.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.404 align:middle line:84%
Give us an overview of
the Mojave incident.

00:02:03.404 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Well, I think
one of the things that

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
makes this so
chilling is that it

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.160 align:middle line:84%
involved two people in a very
isolated area of the country.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:90%
This would be the East Mojave.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So these are two--
a young couple,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:90%
upwardly mobile professionals.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Married?

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Married, two children.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:84%
They leave the children
behind to get away.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:90%
A little vacation.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: A vacation.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
The wife wants to go to a place
called Whiskey Pete's to dance

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:90%
and listen to some music.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:90%
The husband wants to go hunting.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.670 align:middle line:90%
So they combine it.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
They wanted then to go to
the Midland Hills campsite.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And this didn't happen
often, but it was sold out.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So what they decided to do then
was to go into the East Mojave,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:90%
into the desert themselves.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Alone.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Alone.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where he was going
to go hunting the next morning.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:90%
They built a campfire.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And some of the most dramatic
and most credible and most

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:84%
unearthly things you could
imagine went on after that.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's talk
about some of that.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So the desert is filled
with noise in the evening.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.562 align:middle line:84%
So they cook up a
couple of steaks.

00:03:10.562 --> 00:03:11.520 align:middle line:90%
They have their camper.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:90%
They have their campfire.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Actually, afterwards they're
roasting marshmallows

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and throwing some breadcrumbs
and whatnot to these kangaroo

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:90%
rats which are running around.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.171 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
secluded, right?

00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Absolutely secluded.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.410 align:middle line:84%
But the desert, as
I said, is noisy.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So Steve Hess-- so
Steve and Dawn Hess.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Steve Hess, the husband,
looks over his shoulder

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and behind a
mountain and he sees

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
a UFO about 30 feet
in diameter just move

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:90%
to the right of the mountain.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About how far away?

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.428 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Not far away.

00:03:44.428 --> 00:03:47.014 align:middle line:90%
Maybe 50, 75 yards.

00:03:47.014 --> 00:03:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, not far at all.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Not far at all.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: So the
wife was already

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
kind of ill at ease being
in the desert as they were.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And the UFO tucked behind,
almost like it peeked out,

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:90%
peeked out at him.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.017 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And came back.

00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: And he has this chill.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's hovering?

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yes.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.031 align:middle line:84%
And he had a UFO experience
when he was a child,

00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:09.905 align:middle line:90%
but he almost forgot.

00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:84%
He was eight or nine
years old, fishing.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:90%
They ran away.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
He and a friend ran
away from a UFO.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:84%
But it came crashing back into
his mind when he saw that.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't want
to alarm his wife,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:84%
because she's already a little
uneasy about the desert.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.694 align:middle line:90%
So he just keeps it to himself.

00:04:26.694 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're roasting
marshmallows.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
they're stargazing.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
this is a double star

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:90%
and this is this constellation.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And the wife, who is not so
familiar with these things,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.254 align:middle line:84%
says, well, if this
is a double star, that

00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:40.170 align:middle line:90%
must be a triple star.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that one?

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: And this
thing is shining

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:84%
bright as a diamond in the
black sky over this mountain

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.110 align:middle line:90%
range, Tabletop Mountain.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And he gets very nervous
then, but he tries to keep it.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't want to
make her more alarmed.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.600 align:middle line:90%
So the one turns into nine.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: And these
nine shiny objects

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:84%
form the configuration
of a large M sprawling

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:90%
over the mountain range.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he think they
were nine separate objects?

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yes.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yes.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And they start blinking, as
if in coordinated fashion

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:90%
communicating in some way.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.927 align:middle line:90%
Now they're all alarmed.

00:05:15.927 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
First he says, well, maybe
it's a weather balloon.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's a military exercise.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's this or that.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:84%
But he has this
experience from when

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:84%
he was a kid, which
chills him to the bone.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.302 align:middle line:90%
So now they're really scared.

00:05:28.302 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So they start
looking at it, trying

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what it
could be, maybe it's

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.560 align:middle line:84%
a military operation, when all
of a sudden nine become 100

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:90%
and the 100 become 200.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: And the
entire sky is lit up

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:84%
with these shining objects
blinking to one another.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Now they're really alarmed.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.789 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
makes them terrified

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.830 align:middle line:84%
is when these things start
falling to the ground.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Coming down.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: And what they
see are these red eyes

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:84%
in the dark, hundreds of red
eyes charging towards them.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And the husband, who was
there to hunt, goes back

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.309 align:middle line:90%
into the camper, gets a--

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gets his
shotgun or a rifle.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: --shotgun and
a loop of ammunition.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That'll help.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Exactly.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.550 align:middle line:84%
But the wife then starts to
get these telepathic messages.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.880 align:middle line:84%
If you try to harm us, if
you don't do what we say,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:90%
we'll kill you.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:90%
So she grabs the--

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were that direct.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So she grabs the husband's
arm, says, put the gun down.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And then he starts to feel
the same telepathic message,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.620 align:middle line:90%
get in the camper, just shut up.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Get in the camper.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Put the gun down.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.801 align:middle line:84%
And so he brings the
gun back and they

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:90%
sit in the back of the camper.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the camper.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: And almost like
hypnotized they walk back.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.230 align:middle line:90%
They see two monitors.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:90%
They call them like gray--

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.540 align:middle line:84%
like almost like fire hydrants
that are like electric--

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
emanating electricity or a
force so that every time he

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.466 align:middle line:84%
moves forward to get out,
they move forward toward him.

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
electrical current

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:90%
that he's jarred back by.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: So they're trapped.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they're sitting in
a camper, shotgun across his--

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.009 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Petrified.

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Absolutely petrified.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Their hearts were palpitating
so that they really

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:84%
thought they were on the
verge of heart attacks.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: And that's
when they see out

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.600 align:middle line:84%
of the clouds above
the camper come

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
a UFO the size of a football
field, just hovers above them.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is beyond
the little ones

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.600 align:middle line:90%
that are all over the place.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Now these sort
of gremlin creatures,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:84%
the red-eyed creatures,
are running around.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And this-- you know,
one of the things that

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
made it so compelling
to me and so credible

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:84%
was first of all, the people
themselves were very, very

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.230 align:middle line:90%
credible.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
But the story is so intricate
and the story is so broad

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.220 align:middle line:90%
that it just rings so true.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But these gremlins were
surrounding the camper.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Admiral
Robert Moore has

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:84%
a statement that could be a
little relevant to this kind

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:90%
of a case.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT MOORE: Hi.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm retired Admiral Moore,
actually forced retirement.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.050 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the
military, I got

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:19.410 align:middle line:84%
wind of various things regarding
extraterrestrials and UFOs,

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and I started to
speak out on it.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.227 align:middle line:84%
The so-called guys in black
came and visited me one time

00:08:25.227 --> 00:08:26.935 align:middle line:84%
in the black suits
and the black glasses,

00:08:26.935 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and basically told
me to shut up.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't, and as a result
within six months later,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.600 align:middle line:84%
was called on the carpet
and forced into retirement.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So I moved out here in the
desert near these bases

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.100 align:middle line:84%
to kind of keep
an eye on things.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.140 align:middle line:90%
And I sort of--

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:90%
I refer to this as Area 52.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of interesting
things out here.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.470 align:middle line:90%
And so far I've been lucky.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.900 align:middle line:84%
However, I'm worried about
those guys in the black coming

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:90%
to visit me once again.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
the former admiral

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:84%
may have touched a little bit
on some of the things that

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:90%
have been going on out there.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I think that this particular
area of the desert, the East

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Mojave--

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get to these sort
of illuminated creatures--

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: --that the
Hesses encounter.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:84%
But the Peyote Indians had
cave drawings, petroglyphs,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.270 align:middle line:84%
that really are
identical in description

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle line:90%
to what the Hesses described.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this has been
going on for a long time.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: I think so.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And actually under
hypnosis, they really

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.707 align:middle line:84%
talk about the breadth of this
and how long it's gone on,

00:09:29.707 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:84%
so I think it's been going
on for quite some time.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So these creatures are
all around the Hesses.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And they changed their name
for a while too, didn't they?

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: The Hesses you mean?

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yes.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.760 align:middle line:84%
What happened was, yeah, they
didn't want a lot of publicity.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:84%
They had young children and
you know how that can go.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So I used the name the
Hesses in the original story,

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.844 align:middle line:84%
and then changed it to
Tom and Elise Gifford.

00:09:52.844 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did that?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: I did, yeah.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:90%
At their-- because I--

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To protect
the innocent, right?

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Exactly.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.409 align:middle line:84%
I thought that would
be preferable to them

00:09:59.409 --> 00:10:00.580 align:middle line:90%
under the circumstances.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.810 align:middle line:84%
As it turned out, they came
out and actually on "Coast

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
to Coast" did a premier
interview for the first time

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.470 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These people,
when this was going on,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:90%
did they actually get captured?

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
They were trapped in
the back of this camper.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.911 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're in the camper.

00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: And I mentioned
this huge UFO comes and hovers

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:90%
above them.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:84%
It starts to shoot a beam
about 200 feet in diameter,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and seems to be collecting
things, shooting things

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:90%
down and picking things up.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, they watch that.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Also, there's sort of
a triangular vehicle

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.590 align:middle line:84%
then, that seems to be
performing some kind of mining

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:84%
operation, because it's
scanning the desert basin,

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and again picking things
up from the ground.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.235 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Picking things up.

00:10:48.235 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: So what they
thought, because there's

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:84%
a smell at this point of sulfur
and a heavy phosphorous-type

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:84%
odor, and a
drilling-- they could

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:84%
feel the vibration in the
camper itself from the ground.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: So they thought it
was a kind of mining operation,

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
like maybe this UFO was
refueling or collecting

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.877 align:middle line:90%
some kind of samples.

00:11:09.877 --> 00:11:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
rare earths in that--

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they were in the
wrong place at the wrong time,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.110 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Either that-- I mean,
there's two ways to look at it.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
One is that they were in the
wrong place at the wrong time

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.351 align:middle line:84%
and this was a kind
of coincidence.

00:11:20.351 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said, all right,
well, here are these people,

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:84%
so let's see what
experiments we can do.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.816 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
experiment on them.

00:11:25.816 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Or Steve Hess, who
had had this experience when

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:84%
he was eight or nine years
old and this new experience--

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that this was something that
was very much planned and quite

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:90%
the reverse

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe
tied together.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Exactly.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So then what happens?

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: So
they're just stunned

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
to see this huge craft overhead,
and this sort of mining

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.380 align:middle line:84%
operation that I
described, and then

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
this beam of light sort
of scanning the desert,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:84%
picking things up, pulling
things down, putting

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:90%
things down.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And nine illuminated figures
surround the camper now.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: So they're
absolutely trapped.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So of course, they
put the curtains shut.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
But these things are so
brilliant in terms of light

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:90%
that they shine through it.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.920 align:middle line:90%
It's an absurd thing.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they're like ghost--

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
ghostly illuminated figures.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: They actually
had physical form,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.810 align:middle line:84%
so they describe them
very vividly in the sense

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that their height is
maybe 5 foot 4, 5 foot 5,

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:84%
so they're not tiny, like
these gremlin-type creatures.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: They have dark eyes
that are sort of lifeless.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And Dawn has described
them as like narrowing,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:84%
but not the parts
of retina and pupil

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.770 align:middle line:90%
that a human eye would have.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.190 align:middle line:90%
They have large heads.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:84%
They have spindly appendages
with three fingers,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and an underdeveloped
torso, like maybe

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:90%
a five-year-old child.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they felt
they were physical.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Absolutely.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:90%
No question about that.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I really made a point of getting
very accurate descriptions

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely physical.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And then the
experiments started.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Dawn Hess
said, I thought

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:84%
that we were trapped like
animals in a cage being

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:22.590 align:middle line:84%
experimented on or that
we were going to die

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:84%
or had died already and
were in hell being tortured.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.866 align:middle line:84%
And they're still in the
camper when this is going on?

00:13:28.866 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: They're
trapped in the camper.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.116 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what
did they do to them?

00:13:32.116 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Well, as
you can imagine,

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.730 align:middle line:84%
these are hugging
each other, praying.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These beings
are all around them.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.063 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Their
hearts are palpitating

00:13:40.063 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and they feel like they're
on the verge of having

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:90%
heart attacks.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But what happens then
is a kind of experiment

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I guess you would call
it, where each of them

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:90%
is almost drilled mentally.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And out of their
minds, they're forced

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:03.610 align:middle line:84%
to relive some good memories and
some terrifying and horrifying

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:90%
memories.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.368 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In their life.

00:14:05.368 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: In their life.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Very emotional.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: So for example, and
I don't want to dwell on this,

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
but Dawn Hess when
she was younger

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.280 align:middle line:90%
had had a molestation situation.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.882 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: And she was forced
to relive that moment to moment

00:14:20.882 --> 00:14:21.682 align:middle line:90%
and to--

00:14:21.682 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
they do that to her?

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Well, under
discussion and hypnosis,

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.460 align:middle line:90%
that question was asked.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.410 align:middle line:90%
And the answer was this.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
emotions like we do.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:84%
They want to make contact
with humankind in a major way.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But they don't feel they can
do it unless two things happen.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:84%
One is that over time,
humans are desensitized--

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To them.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: --to them, the
fact that they exist.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And numbers would
really point to that.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just 30 years ago,
maybe 10% of the population

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.802 align:middle line:84%
thought Earth had been
visited by aliens.

00:14:58.802 --> 00:15:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Now it's something
like 75% or 80%.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.468 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now it's huge, yeah.

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: So a huge
change has gone on.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So there has been
this desensitization.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is that they want

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.600 align:middle line:90%
to understand human emotions.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would look at
these as experiments

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:84%
to see fear, sadness,
terror, et cetera,

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.397 align:middle line:84%
so that this communication
can happen without hysteria.

00:15:18.397 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're
experimenting with them.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Did they ever physically
take them somewhere?

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Well, these
experiments went on for hours.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.049 align:middle line:90%
And as I--

00:15:30.049 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Emotional, emotional
experiments, I would call them.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: And as
I mentioned, they

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.198 align:middle line:84%
thought they were going
to have a heart attack.

00:15:36.198 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And so when they would
get so worked up,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.907 align:middle line:84%
praying and literally
pinching one another--

00:15:43.907 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and this is the kind of detail
that makes it so credible

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.040 align:middle line:90%
to me--

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.040 align:middle line:90%
pinching one another.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Describe this to me.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is exactly
what people would do.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And so when they felt they were
on the verge of either going

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:84%
mad or dying physically,
a mist would come in

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.015 align:middle line:84%
and it would calm them,
like anesthesia or--

00:16:07.015 --> 00:16:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a spray, huh?

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Like a mist would just
cloud into the camper

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and it would calm them.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost like
scientists keeping,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, animals
alive for experimentation.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.400 align:middle line:84%
We don't want them
to die, because we

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:90%
need to do more experiment.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: And so they were kept
purposefully from having heart

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.746 align:middle line:90%
attacks or from going--

00:16:27.746 --> 00:16:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keeping them calm.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Exactly, which
I found quite incredible.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But they do wind
up on the craft.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a story.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.971 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: But they do
wind up on the craft.

00:16:35.971 --> 00:16:40.930 align:middle line:84%
They wake up with no memory
of being on the craft

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and it was recovered
retrogressively.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they know
if it took them anywhere

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.347 align:middle line:84%
or if they just were
carried along the craft?

00:16:48.347 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: I'll tell you, it's
another interesting aspect

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.850 align:middle line:90%
of the story.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned this sort
of triangular mining

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:56.830 align:middle line:90%
searcher they called it.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Now that was separate from
the bigger craft, right?

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Correct.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But it came out of
the bigger craft.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.099 align:middle line:84%
And they felt the
ground like rumbling.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:84%
They felt the ground
vibrating beneath them.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And they felt the camper
ultimately being lifted up.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The entire-- like the
ground didn't change.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:90%
The horizon--

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sucked it right in.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yes.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything, the
horizon everything.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.616 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That happens.

00:17:19.616 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: They felt a very
cool-- everything got cold.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And the rest is blank
to them and, again,

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:84%
was recovered through
retrogressive hypnosis

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:32.530 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. William Anixter in
Asheville, North Carolina.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Around that area
is a hotbed of UFO activity.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.770 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, a Palm
Springs television station

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.154 align:middle line:90%
did its own investigation.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.240 align:middle line:10%
- In a remote area of Southern
California's Mojave Desert,

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:10%
strange things seem to
happen in the starry sky.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:10%
- It's just standing
there flashing.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:10%
Do you have any idea what it is?

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.630 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:02.430 align:middle line:10%
- Nice.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:10%
I hope I got it.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.380 align:middle line:10%
- We thought that was the
weirdest thing I ever saw.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:10%
- People are
documenting what they

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:10%
say are unidentified
flying objects.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:10%
We traveled to the area where
these sightings are happening,

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:27.610 align:middle line:10%
to Giant Rock, arguably
the largest freestanding

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.280 align:middle line:10%
boulder in the world.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.270 align:middle line:10%
It's in the desert
north of Joshua Tree.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:10%
- This was a place where
a family of three lived,

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:10%
George Van Tassel, his wife
Eva, and his three daughters.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's also a place where
they had a UFO convention.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.530 align:middle line:10%
- Barbara Harris is
a UFO researcher,

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:53.710 align:middle line:10%
she says in the 1940s and '50s,
as many as 15,000 people would

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:10%
show up to hear
Van Tassel speak.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:02.880 align:middle line:10%
He claimed to have contact
with Venus and flying saucers.

And as I mentioned,
it goes back--

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
you can go back 500, 600, 700
years to the Indian tribes that

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.230 align:middle line:90%
lived in that area.

it just stunning

00:19:16.161 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that they would be doing the
Mojave twins, for example,

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:24.670 align:middle line:84%
ground art that can only be
seen from an aerial view, that

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.087 align:middle line:84%
almost duplicates the
description I just gave you

00:19:27.087 --> 00:19:28.420 align:middle line:90%
of that the Hesses talked about.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, and it appears
that it's still ongoing.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Hesses' case,
when did that happen?

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: It happened
in October of 1989.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: '89.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yes.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at these
clips from 2012, '13, '14.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
People are seeing strange
things in the sky.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:90%
It's ongoing.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yes.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
my own theory about this--

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and it plays much with
the desensitization idea--

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:84%
is that over time, if you
look at these sort of hazy

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.390 align:middle line:84%
photographs that were taken in
'56, '57, when the term flying

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:84%
saucer was first coined,
to Betty and Barney Hill

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s, to Budd Hopkins and
a lot of the abduction research

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:84%
he did, to the Phoenix
Lights where Fife Symington,

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.209 align:middle line:84%
the governor of Arizona, saw
an aircraft the size of a--

00:20:14.209 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laughed about
it in the beginning,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.130 align:middle line:90%
but changed his tune.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: He surely did.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:90%
He surely did.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was on the
Larry King show with him

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and he fully admitted
that what they saw

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:84%
might have been
extraterrestrial.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: I saw that, and
it's an incredible description

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:90%
that he gave.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Point being
I think there's really

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.760 align:middle line:84%
a progression towards exactly
what Dawn Hess was discussing,

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.400 align:middle line:84%
which is a major encounter
between an alien civilization

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:90%
and humans that will happen.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I would think-- when we
asked her under hypnosis,

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.230 align:middle line:84%
when will this happen, because
she said this will happen--

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:90%
so I said, in my lifetime?

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.150 align:middle line:84%
She goes, how long
will you live?

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: So I said, well, how
about my children's lifetime?

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.410 align:middle line:84%
She said, in your
children's lifetime.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that timetable,
as you just pointed out,

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.220 align:middle line:90%
is really much on schedule.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I think it's headed that way.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they get hurt
at all during this situation?

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Well, you know, one
thing I just wanted to add,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:84%
there were different
kinds of alien beings.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And just before
they were taken up

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
onto the craft, a sort
of angelic figure--

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.059 align:middle line:84%
and by this I mean
literally a kind of--

00:21:19.059 --> 00:21:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a god-like angel.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Like an angel came
down to-- because they, again,

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:90%
were incredibly distressed.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:90%
You'll survive this.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be all right.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:84%
You'll be back
with your children.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Things will be OK.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:84%
They called her, because it
was clearly a feminine force,

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.660 align:middle line:90%
their comforter.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's when things
started to subside.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And they wound up going
up into the craft.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:84%
But the religious
elements of this,

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
you really wonder
if it's because they

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:84%
were testing their mind
and trying to probe,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and so they had a predisposition
towards religious images,

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.790 align:middle line:84%
devils, the gremlins,
scientists, angels, et cetera,

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:84%
or if in a way this
isn't like lifting

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
a veil on a whole universe, a
whole parallel universe that

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.570 align:middle line:84%
exists side by side with us but
we don't see very, very often.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost
as if, Ron, they

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:84%
sense the tension from the
human, the obvious tension,

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and they step in
and change things,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:84%
or they bring other elements
into it to calm them down.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:23.980 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So I find what is fascinating
is the intricacy of it,

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.310 align:middle line:84%
that it's so intricate, that
it's like another universe.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not just an encounter.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a veil lifting to
something entirely different

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:84%
that could exist
side by side with us.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were both
the Hesses hypnotized?

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yes.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And like
Barney and Betty Hill,

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:47.710 align:middle line:84%
under hypnosis they told
a very similar story.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.190 align:middle line:84%
I remember I'm 21
years old at the time

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and I interview
Dr. Benjamin Simon,

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:90%
who was their psychiatrist.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on the phone with him,
recording him from Detroit.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I was at a radio station
there called WCAR.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking to him about
this incredible case, Barney

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.890 align:middle line:90%
and Betty Hill.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Sure.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is 1971,
and the Hill case

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:84%
had been disclosed
by "Look" magazine

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.140 align:middle line:90%
several years before that.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.580 align:middle line:90%
And it was an amazing story.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And I specifically
asked Dr. Simon, I said,

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.180 align:middle line:90%
were they telling you the truth?

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, George,
whatever happened to them--

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
happened to them, he says.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:84%
But whatever happened to them,
they believe it to be true.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, under
hypnosis, as I

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
hypnotized both of
them separately,

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:90%
they told the same story.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I've never
seen that happen before

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:90%
with people who were lying.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So he says, I think
they're telling the truth.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:84%
What they saw, they think
they're seeing, was the truth.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And in separate
cases of hypnotism,

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.170 align:middle line:84%
they both reveal the same
thing, how they were picked up,

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.070 align:middle line:90%
everything else.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like the same
thing with the Hesses.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.835 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Absolutely.

00:24:05.835 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
They were done
separately, then together.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:84%
But the stories
completely meshed,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
almost like pieces in
a puzzle, because they

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.380 align:middle line:90%
were separated on the craft.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.471 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: And they talk about--

00:24:17.471 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Steve Hess talks about
fighting, struggling.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know, George,
if you see these--

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.806 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is human nature.

00:24:23.806 --> 00:24:24.606 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Oh.

00:24:24.606 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you see them
under hypnosis,

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:84%
you can see this
fellow literally

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:84%
while he's talking about going
through the motions and the--

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's not acting.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: No.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did it end,
the abduction case end?

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Well, basically they
were examined on the craft.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:90%
We got that from the hypnosis.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did
they do that to us?

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think
they had experimented enough

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:90%
with us, but they keep doing it.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:10%
Well, you know, this is what--

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:10%
this was a question that came
up during hypnosis to Dawn Hess.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
extraordinary thing,

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.520 align:middle line:90%
and talk about chilling.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.770 align:middle line:84%
What's chilling
is to see somebody

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:84%
that's sort of shy, again
college-educated, so

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:90%
articulate, et cetera.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: But not somebody
that's very, very outgoing,

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and not somebody that's
very direct in that she

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:84%
would talk like a normal
person would talk.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But when asked, so why are they
doing this, all of a sudden

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:90%
the mechanics changed.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden she's
rigid in her chair.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uptight?

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.363 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: All of a sudden
there's a cadence to her voice

00:25:35.363 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:90%
that's almost robotic.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And she says, there
are five galaxies

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.720 align:middle line:90%
and there's one supreme.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And the one supreme wants
to bring the five galaxies

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.180 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And he's starting with Earth.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:84%
He wants them to
live in harmony.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to deliver
a message that if we

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.962 align:middle line:84%
destroy ourselves or are on the
verge of destroying ourselves,

00:25:54.962 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it
sure looks like we

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:84%
are on the verge of
destroying ourselves--

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We sure are.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: --we will intervene.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And it won't be a
good thing, because it

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
will change the destiny,
the plan for humankind.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:84%
That's the first time I've ever
heard that they would admit

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.180 align:middle line:90%
that they would intervene.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Most of the things I've
heard in the past, Ron,

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:84%
they have this hands-off
attitude toward us.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
But they would
step in, you think.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: This was very clear.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So this was an
interesting comment.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So I said, what
else do you know?

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:90%
I know where the universe ends.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:90%
And again, very staccato voice.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Our universe ends
where theirs begins.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Our universe ends when its
matter stops mattering to us

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.120 align:middle line:90%
and starts mattering to them.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: What an
incredible play on words.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.015 align:middle line:84%
That was like worthy of
Shakespeare or Chaucer.

00:26:45.015 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: But spit out like--

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:90%
very, very direct.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you listen
to that message,

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.550 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of a veiled threat.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:84%
When things stop-- when this
Earth stops mattering to us,

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.750 align:middle line:90%
it will start mattering to them.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm assuming the
camper is brought

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.070 align:middle line:84%
back down to good old
planet Earth, put down

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.570 align:middle line:90%
on the Mojave Desert.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.490 align:middle line:90%
The craft takes off.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:14.620 align:middle line:84%
At what point do the Hesses
kind of wake up and say, whoa,

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.760 align:middle line:90%
what happened to us?

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Actually, so they're out of
the camper the next morning.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
The sun is out, of course, and
they're laying on the ground.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.340 align:middle line:84%
The campfire is
dead, so they know

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:84%
a significant amount
of time has gone by.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:90%
They think the world has ended.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.825 align:middle line:84%
They literally think
that there was a--

00:27:31.825 --> 00:27:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is a
"Twilight Zone" movie now.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: They think that
there was an alien invasion

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:38.959 align:middle line:90%
and that the world is ending.

00:27:38.959 --> 00:27:40.208 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They both think this.

00:27:40.208 --> 00:27:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yes.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So they turn the
radio on, of course.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.950 align:middle line:90%
What they expect to hear is--

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:84%
they hear like a country western
song, Randy Travis singing

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.270 align:middle line:90%
a song or something.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:49.690 align:middle line:90%
They go--

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Life goes on.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:51.611 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Well, let's go.

00:27:51.611 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:84%
They started fishing
through the radio channel

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:90%
and there's no report of it.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're stunned,
because again, to them,

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.320 align:middle line:90%
this is their world.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:84%
This is like such a traumatic,
huge event in their life

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.890 align:middle line:84%
that they can't imagine
that the rest of the world

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know about this.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Prior to your book,
how did the word come out--

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:84%
where your friend, for example,
who told you about this,

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.236 align:middle line:90%
how did it get out?

00:28:20.236 --> 00:28:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Prior
to it, it didn't.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the
Hesses go public?

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: It didn't.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did not.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.105 align:middle line:90%
They just told your friend?

00:28:25.105 --> 00:28:25.905 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:28:25.905 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:90%
What happened was, frankly--

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess they spoke
to their parents about it,

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and sort of with
a mixed reaction.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Well,
I'm sure you think

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:37.970 align:middle line:90%
this is what happened to you.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.639 align:middle line:84%
Parents probably went, eh, what
were you smoking out there--

00:28:40.639 --> 00:28:42.457 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: I don't want
to speak for them.

00:28:42.457 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in the Mojave Desert?

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:43.882 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:28:43.882 --> 00:28:45.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
speak for them, but I

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:84%
don't think it was the most
satisfying engagement, where

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:90%
we're sure, we believe you.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.850 align:middle line:90%
It didn't go that way.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:56.276 align:middle line:84%
And just generally, these
guys had a responsible job.

00:28:56.276 --> 00:28:57.400 align:middle line:90%
And you know how that goes.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You bring
these stories to that,

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.036 align:middle line:84%
they begin to look at you
with a different light.

00:29:03.036 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: I think so.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Contrary to coming out
or looking for publicity,

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.950 align:middle line:90%
it was really the opposite.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.020 align:middle line:90%
They buried this inside them.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I think they had
some real dysfunction in terms

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.680 align:middle line:90%
of insomnia and neuroses.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, Dr.
Bernard Vittone,

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.836 align:middle line:84%
who studied them for
neurotic behavior--

00:29:23.836 --> 00:29:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For a
medical condition.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: To put that
aside as not a factor

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
in the case, described their
symptoms as those of a POW,

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.250 align:middle line:90%
that really they were like POWs.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.140 align:middle line:84%
They had been through
such a traumatizing event

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.910 align:middle line:84%
that it affected them
in many, many ways,

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.680 align:middle line:90%
physically and psychologically.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Steve Hess, for example, who's
this go-getter, upwardly mobile

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:84%
guy, a couple of kids,
mortgage, all of a sudden,

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:90%
he has no interest in work.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:52.900 align:middle line:90%
He has no interest in life.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.580 align:middle line:90%
His desires of everything gone.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Because
he feels like--

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it must be like the
astronauts that go to the moon.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.790 align:middle line:84%
They come back and this
is just regular life.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.220 align:middle line:90%
I was on the moon.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.440 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of the
feeling that he had.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't-- the day-to-day
things didn't matter to him

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:84%
anymore, because
this was so enormous.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.880 align:middle line:84%
The enormity of it
like swept him--

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.960 align:middle line:90%
swept him away.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sadly we
have two investigators

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.670 align:middle line:84%
in the alien abduction
phenomenon who

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:23.960 align:middle line:84%
are no longer with us, Budd
Hopkins and Dr. John Mack.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.876 align:middle line:84%

who says he has made
contact and says

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.420 align:middle line:10%
he's actually been abducted
by aliens more than once.

Miles O'Brien is here.

I don't mean to make
fun, but come on.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.638 align:middle line:10%
- Well that's
actually not unusual.

00:30:50.638 --> 00:30:53.970 align:middle line:10%
A lot of abductees have had the
experience more than one time.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.550 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about close
encounters of the fourth kind.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:84%
That's when a human is
abducted by an alien.

The majority of the people who
say this has happened to them

00:31:08.169 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:10%
do not have symptoms
of mental illness.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:10%

mind about all of this

we often forget how much unites
all the members of humanity.

I was doing thrillers.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.424 align:middle line:84%

>>FELBER: Well, a lot like Dr.
Anixter, who retrogressed them,

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.310 align:middle line:90%
I looked at the options.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.500 align:middle line:90%
One option is they're lying.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.458 align:middle line:84%
And I can just discount
that right off the bat.

00:34:48.458 --> 00:34:50.020 align:middle line:90%
It makes absolutely no sense.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.510 align:middle line:90%
It's totally out of character.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.659 align:middle line:84%
The other is that there was
a massive misunderstanding.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:57.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's a little like Fife
Symington, governor of Arizona.

there any possibility

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:84%

genetically altered,

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.120 align:middle line:90%
played with, manipulated?

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Did anything like that happen?

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:27.534 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: Well, you know, this
went on after the experience

00:35:27.534 --> 00:35:28.950 align:middle line:84%
when they were
back in their home.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:33.330 align:middle line:84%
They had several-- call them
visitations, if you like.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And during the event
itself in the camper,

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Dawn Hess had felt
like a kind of flicker,

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:44.735 align:middle line:84%
like almost the
butt of a cigarette,

00:35:44.735 --> 00:35:47.790 align:middle line:84%
the lighted part of a cigarette
was flicked through the window

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:49.290 align:middle line:90%
into her stomach.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And she became pregnant
not many weeks after that.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And so there was the feeling
that perhaps Amberley--

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.980 align:middle line:84%
which was the name
of the child that--

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.580 align:middle line:90%
the third child they had--

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:84%
was maybe affected
by this or maybe she

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.470 align:middle line:90%
had actually been impregnated.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.470 align:middle line:84%
But all I can say
is from what I know,

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Amberley is perfectly
normal and healthy

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.840 align:middle line:90%
and an intelligent young woman.

this affected you?

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.230 align:middle line:84%

see things in a certain way.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:34.925 align:middle line:84%
And so you go through life
and there's a paradigm.

you buy your house,

to new ideas or new concepts.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day,
this is a much bigger world.

>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:18.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a scary scene.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.610 align:middle line:90%
I love that scene.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:22.410 align:middle line:90%
They're out there.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yeah.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.000 align:middle line:90%
I have to agree.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that, again, if you
put everything in context

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:32.064 align:middle line:84%
and just try to be logical about
it and have no pre-judgment,

00:38:32.064 --> 00:38:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I think you come
to the conclusion

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.040 align:middle line:84%
that, again, this is an
important piece of the puzzle,

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.740 align:middle line:90%
but it's a very big puzzle.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ron, Dr. David Jacobs
believes that these visitations

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.720 align:middle line:84%
are not friendly, that
there's some other nefarious

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.210 align:middle line:90%
reason that they're happening.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.100 align:middle line:90%
That's a scary theory.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.300 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.880 align:middle line:84%
He believes that
they are doing things

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.230 align:middle line:84%
to us to enhance them,
not us, and that they

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.060 align:middle line:90%
would do anything--

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.300 align:middle line:90%
anything-- to get to that goal.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:07.347 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: You know, I think
the jury's out on that.

00:39:07.347 --> 00:39:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hope he's wrong

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: I hope--

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I think we all probably
hope he's wrong.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.710 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't say
that it's nefarious.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that it's
evil or something like that.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's a lot
more akin to scientists,

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.870 align:middle line:84%
much as we have scientists
that study other life forms.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:29.485 align:middle line:84%
Now, for example, I mean
animal life or plant life or--

00:39:29.485 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think you
take it from a sort

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.010 align:middle line:90%
of clinical point of view.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
more of what we

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:42.480 align:middle line:84%
see than evil or somebody that
has this dark outlook on us.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I would think, particularly
when we talk about intervening,

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:49.360 align:middle line:84%
if we're about to destroy
ourselves or our planet,

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.290 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it
from that standpoint,

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.950 align:middle line:84%
what I got out of it--
and this is me talking--

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:59.850 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
this is good advice

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.410 align:middle line:90%
from a parent to a child.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Go easy.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.210 align:middle line:90%
Learn to live in harmony.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Learn the consequences
of the things you do,

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.690 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't, the
destiny for your planet

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and you as a race is
not a positive one.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you look at it
from an anthropomorphic point

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:24.270 align:middle line:84%
of view, a human point of
view, that's not a threat.

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that's some
good friendly advice.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if what
you say happens,

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:31.770 align:middle line:84%
where in your
children's life they're

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:35.820 align:middle line:84%
going to get
disclosure in some way,

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.800 align:middle line:90%
how will this planet react?

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Even though, as you've
said, 70-some percent of us

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:84%
believe in extraterrestrial
life, some of us

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:84%
believe that we've
been visited, how

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:50.970 align:middle line:84%
will we really react
when we know for real

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.316 align:middle line:90%
that this is happening?

00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: You know,
we talked about why

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.210 align:middle line:84%
do these abductions
happen so frequently.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that's exactly why,
so that when this does happen,

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:04.800 align:middle line:84%
they'll understand the human
mentality enough to position it

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.540 align:middle line:90%
in a way that's more embracing.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't panic.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: And more
like a reunion.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Perhaps.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You remember
the movie "Contact,"

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.740 align:middle line:10%
where out in the desert
you had thousands

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.160 align:middle line:10%
and thousands of people
waiting for contact and stuff

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:19.960 align:middle line:10%
like that?

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: Yes.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It might
be like that too.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FELBER: I think people hunger.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.670 align:middle line:90%
People hunger for their origin.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe we're
feeling like orphaned children.

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe this will
not be a negative thing.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:35.980 align:middle line:90%
I think maybe it will be Eden.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:37.738 align:middle line:90%
I think it will happen.

00:41:37.738 --> 00:41:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think it
will happen that way.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.889 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I think if things
go according to plan--

00:41:42.889 --> 00:41:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and I think there
is a human destiny.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:45.480 align:middle line:90%
I think there is a plan.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're
just here like corks

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:51.000 align:middle line:84%
bobbing up and
down on the ocean.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.260 align:middle line:84%
If they go according to
plan, I think that, as I say,

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.020 align:middle line:84%
it'll be more like a
reunion than an invasion.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has this
experience with the Hesses,

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:03.120 align:middle line:84%
what has it-- what
has it taught you?

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FELBER: I think
it's taught me the--

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that the people that are
in charge, the people that

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.600 align:middle line:84%
run things, whether they're
governments or corporations

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.960 align:middle line:84%
or countries or whatever
it might be, really

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.170 align:middle line:84%
maybe are intelligent but
they're not necessarily wise,

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and that the bigger questions,
the questions that really need

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to be answered for humanity, not
the United States or Cincinnati

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:33.450 align:middle line:84%
or Moscow or whatever, but
for humanity, the species,

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.790 align:middle line:84%
very few people take much
time to think about that.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, it's
really eye-opening,

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:41.310 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
information out there

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that people just either
don't get or don't

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.330 align:middle line:84%
manage to ferret out or
lack interest in getting.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:51.576 align:middle line:90%
But I think these are--

00:42:51.576 --> 00:42:52.376 align:middle line:90%

of course, at Barnes & Noble.

And yeah, I'm very
