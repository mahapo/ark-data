00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:17.996 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: We need to
give people the information.

00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:24.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome to this
edition and "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.860 align:middle line:10%
In this edition, we're
going to be talking

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:10%
about a subject that is
very dear to my heart,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:10%
afterlife encounters.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:10%
Our special guest, of
course, is a former director

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:10%
of the Elisabeth Kubler-Ross
Center in Houston--

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:10%
we'll talk about that--

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:10%
and also a noted
author with a couple

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:10%
of works, "Afterlife Encounters"
and "Life After Loss."

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Please welcome to "Beyond
Belief," Dianne Arcangel.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:90%
Dianne, welcome to the program.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DIANNE ARCANGEL: Thank
you so much, George.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to see
you again and be here.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.324 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've
got to ask you,

00:00:55.324 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Arcangel-- because
we have met before.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:90%
We've talked before.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Is that your real
last name, Arcangel?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: That is
my real last name.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I have had people
online say I would read

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:10%
your books but your last
name is so hokey I can't.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could not
come up with a better name.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: And Actually,
when my husband and I got

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.580 align:middle line:84%
married, we both wanted
to change to my name.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
But then he said, that would
be so disrespectful to my dad.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But who knew, George, that in
my line of work, it just fits?

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, if you tell me
his name is Michael or Gabriel,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to freak out.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.934 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: No-- Joe.

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would be
Michael Arcangel or something

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.123 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, tell us a
little bit about how

00:01:32.123 --> 00:01:35.260 align:middle line:84%
you got involved in dealing
with afterlife stories

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:90%
and encounters.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Sure.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I was working as a
hospice chaplain.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of researchers
began coming to me--

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:84%
survival researchers,
meaning life after death--

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:84%
began asking me, you
know, you know a lot,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:90%
Dianne that would help us.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.660 align:middle line:84%
They began asking
me questions which

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.520 align:middle line:84%
led to me conducting a five-year
international research project

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.849 align:middle line:90%
with over 6,000 participants.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty intense.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.142 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Yes.

00:01:58.142 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about the project.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.797 align:middle line:90%
I mean, five years?

00:02:00.797 --> 00:02:01.755 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Five years.

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the
methodology with it?

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I specifically
wanted to know--

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I had heard that afterlife
encounters were helpful,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:90%
that they brought comfort.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't real sure.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So what I wanted
to find out was--

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't on are they evidential
for do we continue after life.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
It was on do they bring
comfort, do they bring hope?

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%
98% said they brought hope
or comfort in some way.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you always a
believer in life after death?

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: George, I was
not always a believer.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.260 align:middle line:84%
My dad, he was a
Baptist minister,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.570 align:middle line:90%
died a horrible, horrible death.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was so absolutely
100% sure there

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:84%
was no life after death, there
was no God, there was nothing.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a
near-death experience.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And yet here was
this being of light.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you sure
got off your path.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.135 align:middle line:84%
And it completely
changed my life.

00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had some
of those thoughts too.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
disheartening thought.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a cold thought.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a lonely thought to think
that this is it, and it ends.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.400 align:middle line:84%
I've always told people,
I've said, hey, first of all,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
if it exists, you'll know
about it when you die.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't, it
doesn't matter.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But I've questioned
the possibilities

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:90%
of whether it exists.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I have come back
to the conclusion

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:90%
that there's something there.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And some of the reasons
for that, Dianne,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
would include why are we
here in the first place?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:84%
There's much more to
life than we even know.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's probably
just a natural offshoot

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:84%
that the other side, which
came first, is all part of this

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:84%
That helps me to
believe that it's real.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That's true.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And in my research,
the first part

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:84%
were just questions of,
did you find comfort?

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:90%
To what degree of comfort?

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:84%
But in the last of it,
there was a comment section,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:84%
where participants could
write in anything they chose.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And your point about what
difference does it make--

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:84%
a widow said that her problem
with the thought of life

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
after death was that
if her husband was

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.492 align:middle line:84%
not everything that
he was during life, so

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:90%
what difference does it make?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
If he's changed, then what
difference is it make?

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
She came home one day,
and there was a message,

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.350 align:middle line:84%
supposedly she said,
by her husband.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And she said, all of
their marriage life

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.529 align:middle line:84%
they had had these
little sweet nothings

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:90%
that they spoke to one another.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Little things that
only two of them would know.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.629 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That's right.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.910 align:middle line:84%
They had agreed that they would
not even tell the daughter.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And they had a song that her
husband would sing to her.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
When she came home, here
on her answering machine

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.400 align:middle line:84%
was her husband's voice,
the sweet nothings

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.550 align:middle line:84%
just exactly as he said, and
him singing her this song.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:90%
She was livid, absolutely livid.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:84%
She said, first of all, she
was angry because someone

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:90%
had played this cruel hoax.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Second of all--

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: First thing
you'd think of.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.511 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That's right.

00:05:05.511 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And she was just
furious that her husband

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:84%
would share something that
they had agreed that they would

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.520 align:middle line:90%
never, ever share with anybody.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
She called the
phone company, said,

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to trace on
this phone call.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.020 align:middle line:84%
She told him that
she was fearful.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
did the trace.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
AT&T came out, did a trace,
worked two days, said,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.935 align:middle line:84%
they could not find the
origination of this phone call.

00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:27.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unlisted.

00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:29.193 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Unlisted,
that's right.

00:05:29.193 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:84%
She called the
police department.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:84%
She called-- very wealthy
lady-- called the police chief.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:84%
George, she finally
wound up getting the best

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:90%
private detective in her state.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:90%
And he checked.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:90%
He check for two months.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:90%
He did everything he could.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Finally he came
out and said, lady,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:84%
all I can tell you is
this phone call did not

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.010 align:middle line:90%
come from this world.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: And she
said, are you telling me

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.145 align:middle line:90%
that that was my husband?

00:05:51.145 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:84%
He said, all I'm telling you
is there is no way this phone

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:90%
call came from this world.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And George, she said
what was important to her

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that
he was the same.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:90%
He hadn't changed.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.460 align:middle line:84%
She said-- so that was
what was important to her

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:84%
was to know not whether we
exist or not, but that she still

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.660 align:middle line:90%
had her husband.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.812 align:middle line:90%
He was still the same.

00:06:11.812 --> 00:06:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And someday they
would be reunited.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
those on the other side

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
actually know, Dianne,
that they're dead?

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when he called and
put the message on the phone,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:84%
he probably said
I'm going to do this

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.860 align:middle line:90%
so she knows I'm still here?

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.139 align:middle line:90%
Or are they just doing this?

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: That's an
excellent question, George,

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
because I do believe they know
what they're doing over there.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I do believe they have
a consciousness where

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:90%
they reach us.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:84%
One question I had asked in
all the years of research,

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
all the researchers that I knew,
we had focused on the living.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have
afterlife encounters?

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Is it our personalities?

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Is it something we're doing?

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:84%
What brings us to have
afterlife encounters.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So I questioned, does it
always have to do with us?

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Can it have something
to do with them?

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.725 align:middle line:84%
So I did a research
project where I asked.

00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I focused on strictly the
person who is deceased

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:90%
and how they were here.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered was
that strong personalities,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:90%
it's a strong energy.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
People who have
strong energies here

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:84%
are more likely to reach
us when they're over there.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.294 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, they do
have a purpose.

00:07:18.294 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:90%
They do have a reason.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they
get reincarnated.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Does that end?

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Like had this woman's husband
reincarnated very fast,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:84%
there might not
have been a message.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:90%
He's gone.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Yeah.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.657 align:middle line:84%
I cannot answer that because
I'm not a reincarnationist.

00:07:35.657 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are researchers
at the University of Virginia

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:84%
who could probably answer
that question brilliantly.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And from my research, the only
thing that I have detected

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:84%
is that they have
not reincarnated yet.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:90%
They're still over there.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:90%
They still have something to do.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
was an expert in
life after death.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about the
center that you

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.405 align:middle line:84%
were working with in
Houston and what they did.

00:08:03.405 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Our
center in Houston

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:90%
was strictly a grief center.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.810 align:middle line:90%
It was a grief support center.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:10%
Elisabeth flew in, and we
had workshops about every six

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:10%
months for the bereaved or for
anyone going through a life

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:10%
transition.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:90%
So but then we did the last day.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Elisabeth's big
day was she came in

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and she discussed
life after death.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And she told stories of
encounters that she had had

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.340 align:middle line:90%
or that someone else that had.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
It was fabulous,
George, just fabulous.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:90%
I miss Elisabeth.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.120 align:middle line:90%
She was incredible.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She was genius.

00:08:31.735 --> 00:08:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: She was.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She really was.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thank god still
have Raymond Moody with us

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:90%
because he's another type.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:10%
When you say to people
who are bereaving,

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:10%
there are a lot of
people who just can't

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:10%
handle the death of someone.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:84%
I specifically, for example,
lost my dad in 2011.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:10%
Then we lost my sister
to brain cancer in 2014.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.221 align:middle line:10%
It's surreal for me.

00:09:00.221 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Part of me thinks
that they're still

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
physically here because I
live in different states

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:90%
and they lived in Detroit.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:10%
My relationship with them was
to see them whenever I got there

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:10%
and to talk to
them on the phone.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's over now.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.250 align:middle line:90%
It's stopped.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But in my mind, they're
still out there.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:84%
They're still alive,
still doing their thing.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But every once in a
while it hits me that no,

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:90%
they've really passed on.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:90%
They're not here now.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:84%
All I have left is my
mother and my sister.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:84%
I guess that would be caused
partially bereavement.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:84%
But there are some people who
just can't really accept that.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.370 align:middle line:10%
And I assume that's why they
go to centers like Elisabeth

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.547 align:middle line:10%
Kubler-Ross's center.

00:09:46.547 --> 00:09:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That is.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Part of it is the acceptance.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And a part of it
is just we have--

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
some people have
so many emotions

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:84%
that it's not safe to
share with a family member

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.994 align:middle line:84%
or it's uncomfortable
to share with a friend.

00:09:57.994 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So they need to
go someplace where

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.270 align:middle line:84%
they can cry, where
they can grieve,

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
where they can work
through those emotions.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we provided.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:84%
We did not allow family
members, friends, anyone

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.980 align:middle line:90%
that that person knew.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:84%
The participant had
to be totally there

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
on his or her own so
they could really emote.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.690 align:middle line:84%
That's so important
with grief is

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.370 align:middle line:84%
to find someone with
whom we can share

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:90%
our feelings about our loss.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The worst
feeling, of course,

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.690 align:middle line:90%
is a parent losing a child.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:90%
That's very difficult.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: It is.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.665 align:middle line:90%
It's so out of the ordinary.

00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:28.935 align:middle line:90%
It's so out of the ordinary--

00:10:28.935 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's unnatural.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: There you go.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
supposed to happen.

00:10:31.325 --> 00:10:32.366 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That's right.

00:10:32.366 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you can't get
someone to stop bereaving,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:90%
What happens to that individual?

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Is there life destroyed?

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Actually, George,
everyone has their own--

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:90%
I say grief is like a snowflake.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Each person grieves in a
completely different way.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Twins can grieve the
loss of their mother

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:84%
totally differently, even
though they're twins.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:90%
They have the same mother.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Their feelings, their hopes,
their thoughts, their dreams

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:90%
are different.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So when a person grieves,
the length of time

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:84%
really depends on
that individual.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And some people
really never stop

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.410 align:middle line:90%
grieving until the day they die.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:90%
That's just their journey.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not a visitor
of cemeteries very often.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't particularly
enjoy going to a cemetery

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
not because I'm
afraid of it or I

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.430 align:middle line:90%
think it's haunted or anything.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will go
just to pay their respects

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:90%
for the dead.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, cemeteries
haven't made much

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:90%
of a difference in my life.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.540 align:middle line:90%
What does that tell you?

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Yes.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.960 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are like that.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm like that.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, when my mother
was alive and she said,

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:84%
oh-- we used to visit my
grandmother's cemetery

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.956 align:middle line:84%
And my mother said, I guess
you will never do this for me.

00:11:50.956 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no because
I'm giving you flowers

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.446 align:middle line:90%
while you're here.

00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you gifts
while you're here.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I won't have a need
to go to the cemetery.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: We're living
life now while we're here.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So I'm not alone there.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: You're not alone.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:90%
You're totally not alone.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:84%
But now some people
find it comforting to go

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:84%
to the cemetery, to
visit the headstone,

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.582 align:middle line:84%
and take flowers and
things like that.

00:12:10.582 --> 00:12:11.915 align:middle line:90%
Again, we're just so individual.

00:12:11.915 --> 00:12:14.414 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a couple
of books out there, of course--

00:12:14.414 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:84%
"Afterlife Encounters"
and "Life After Loss."

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the "Life
After Loss" for a moment here.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
What happens to an
individual after that loss?

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:84%
How do they pick themselves up
and just keep forging ahead?

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: And it's so
different for each person.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Women and men grieve
so differently.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes women will
say, oh, you didn't

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:90%
feel for her, to her husband.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.420 align:middle line:90%
Whereas the husband is busy.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.042 align:middle line:90%
Most men get very busy.

00:12:45.042 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:84%
They start getting
into their work.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
They go out in the garage
and they work on their car.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.110 align:middle line:90%
They go outside and they--

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To keep
their minds off it?

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.623 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: They keep
their minds off of it.

00:12:51.623 --> 00:12:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And then in about two,
maybe a year and a half,

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:84%
two years later, they
begin to really get

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.690 align:middle line:90%
in touch with their feelings.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, by that time, the wife is
past her-- not past her grief,

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:84%
but the really burden of
the loss is beyond her.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So then she says, well,
where were you back

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.060 align:middle line:90%
when I was grieving?

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.392 align:middle line:84%
And this has caused a lot of
divorce, a lot of family issues

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:13.850 align:middle line:84%
because they grieve
so differently.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:14.933 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely, yeah.

00:13:14.933 --> 00:13:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's grief there,
too, with a divorce

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:90%
or an ending of a relationship.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:10%
I was always told it takes
about a month per year

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:10%
to get over some kind of
a situation like that.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you were
married 10 years, it

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:33.720 align:middle line:84%
takes about 10 months before
that starts to wear off,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.692 align:middle line:90%
that feeling of emptiness.

00:13:35.692 --> 00:13:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That makes sense.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know, George,
first, whether it's a death,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:84%
rather, as you say,
it's a divorce,

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.270 align:middle line:84%
we grieve 24/7 for about
three to four days.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's a week--

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.210 align:middle line:84%
in our sleep, in our wake,
no matter where we go,

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
no matter what we do,
grieve for that loss.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.167 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that healthy?

00:13:52.167 --> 00:13:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: It is healthy.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:90%
It's processing.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.110 align:middle line:90%
It's working it through.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:90%
It's very healthy.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.756 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the person who

00:13:57.756 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:84%
just doesn't show
emotion, who doesn't cry

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:90%
during the loss of somebody?

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: We say
it's-- when you say, oh,

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.696 align:middle line:84%
somebody's really holding up
really well; she didn't cry,

00:14:06.696 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and we say, oh, she's
holding up really well,

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.230 align:middle line:84%
she may be be falling
on the floor crying.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.146 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:14:11.146 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: It's the old
thing with Jacqueline Kennedy

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.346 align:middle line:90%
after her husband was killed.

00:14:14.346 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She seemed like a rock.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Very stoic--

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unless she
fell apart later.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: And you
know what was not

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:84%
reported until many,
many years later

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:90%
is that she would take a yacht.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:84%
No one was allowed on the
yacht except for the driver.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:84%
They would go out way,
way far into the ocean.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, she would lean
over and scream and yell and sob

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:90%
and cry and cry and cry.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:84%
But he was the only one
who knew anything about it.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:90%
So she did.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:84%
She just didn't show it
in front of anyone else.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was her way.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That was her way.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
eventually it stopped.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Yes.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It wears off.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:84%
What is it about the
human body, the condition,

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:59.920 align:middle line:84%
to make that bereavement,
that pain just go away?

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you sit back--
people who sit back--

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:90%
I do that.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I've had situations
in my life where

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:90%
things were tough for a while.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:84%
But then it's gone,
and I've never

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:84%
have that feeling of
bereavement again or sadness.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm two
different people.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.850 align:middle line:90%
What causes that to happen?

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: When you ask about
the body, the instant we hear

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:84%
bad news, the instant we
hear someone has died,

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.900 align:middle line:84%
something has happened, we have
a chemical change in the brain.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Those chemicals rush
throughout our entire bodies

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.160 align:middle line:90%
from head to toe--

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:90%
very important to drink water.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I never gave advice to anyone,
except if you can tolerate

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:84%
water, please drink water
after you've bereaved

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.439 align:middle line:84%
or you've had some kind of
stressful circumstances.

00:15:47.439 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That helps, huh?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: It does.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.954 align:middle line:90%
It really helps.

00:15:49.954 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:90%
So you see, the body--

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about Jack
Daniels, does that help?

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: [LAUGHS] Well, it's
best not to avoid anything.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing
with alcohol, with sex,

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:84%
with things that people a lot
get into, where they move away

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
or they don't
handle their grief--

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:90%
it comes back later.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:90%
It really comes back later.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.370 align:middle line:84%
The best thing to do is just
go as natural as you can

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and deal with it
right now because--

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I know I would rather
deal with mine now,

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:84%
where I know what's going on,
rather than have it pop up,

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:84%
say, during an
interview like this.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm learning
that life in the process

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:90%
of that is also death.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And though you don't
want it to happen

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:84%
to someone who
has not completed,

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.230 align:middle line:90%
to me, what is a good run--

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.920 align:middle line:84%
I thought my sister
died too early at 56.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I thought my dad at
88 had a great run.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I grieved
differently that way.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.565 align:middle line:84%
God willing, if I could
get to 88, that'd be great.

00:16:52.565 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:84%
So I look at it in those
different perspectives.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:90%
I would hate to see a child die.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I would hate to see
somebody in their teens die.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:90%
To me, they shorten their life.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody gets into
their mid 70s and their 80s,

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:84%
it's a fact that
you're going to die.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.240 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
And I'm constantly, when I'm
researching coast to coast

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and there's a story about
so-and-so just passed on

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:24.579 align:middle line:84%
or a well-known celebrity
or somebody, that happens.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:10%
And I've been
doing some research

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.720 align:middle line:10%
into Frank Sinatra,
who would have

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:10%
been 100 years old this year.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:90%
And he's dead, as is his buddy.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Sammy Davis, Jr. is dead.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Joey Bishop is dead.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Dean Martin is dead.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Peter Lawford is dead.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:90%
This Rat Pack, they're all gone.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a process of living.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Time eventually will get us all.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And you have to recognize
that and accept it

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and just hope that
you get a good run--

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:90%
simple as that.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.791 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: And that's a good
point that you brought up

00:17:58.791 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
about how you grieve differently
for your father as you did,

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:90%
say, for your sister.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.610 align:middle line:84%
That not only do different
people grieve differently,

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:84%
but we each grieve differently
for that particular loss.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.741 align:middle line:84%
No two losses are
ever the same for us.

00:18:12.741 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If she had gotten
another 20 years out of it,

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I would have said, all right,
76 years old, good run--

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:84%
sad, unfortunate,
but a good run.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.760 align:middle line:90%
88-- same thing.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.337 align:middle line:90%
But 56, to me, that's young.

00:18:26.337 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That is young.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And then what about tragedies,
bereavement after tragedies?

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Not just somebody who died
in the hospital of old age,

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:84%
but somebody who
died and you get

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:84%
that call, so-and-so's
dead from a car accident,

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.045 align:middle line:90%
how do you react to that?

00:18:45.045 --> 00:18:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: George,
we have found

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:84%
there's a difference, like
you were saying with your dad,

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:84%
in an extended illness
or someone who's older

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to a sudden loss.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:84%
With sudden loss,
we've got the, [GASP]..

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:90%
We have that shock.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those are the worst.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:18:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Oh, yes.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're the worst!

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.031 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: The
shock-- but the thing

00:19:02.031 --> 00:19:06.010 align:middle line:84%
is that we haven't had this long
illness where we're exhausted

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.810 align:middle line:84%
from the long illness
of being the support

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:90%
person for that person.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have the energy
to deal with it

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to an extended loss.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Say someone has cancer
for many, many years,

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and we are the caregiver,
and we're just exhausted.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So when the death
comes, it's different

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.062 align:middle line:84%
for that long-time loss
because we are so exhausted.

00:19:25.062 --> 00:19:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a strange
relief, isn't it?

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Yes, it is a strange
relief, and it's an exhaustion,

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:90%
and we're over it.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Afterlife Encounters,"
one of your other books--

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.307 align:middle line:84%
give us a story, one
of your favorites.

00:19:36.307 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Oh, one of
my favorite stories--

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.860 align:middle line:84%
oh of course the telephone
call with the widow.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Probably Beverly-- her
son Tommy came to her.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
A fascinating woman
in New York City--

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.860 align:middle line:90%
her son Tommy had been murdered.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.826 align:middle line:84%
The problem was the police
said when they came to her home

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
they would never be able--
it would be a cold case.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.870 align:middle line:84%
They'd never be able
to find out anything

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.120 align:middle line:84%
because his body had
been transported.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:90%
He'd been killed.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
His body had been
transported, left

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.525 align:middle line:90%
at the police station in a van.

00:20:05.525 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So they said, there's
no way we'll ever

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:90%
find-- we're really sorry.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:84%
At 2 o'clock in the
morning, Tommy came to her

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:90%
and said, Mom!

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Mom!

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Hurry!

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Hurry!

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:90%
My blood is in the snow.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.970 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go find it now
because it's going to melt. Go

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:84%
to Washington and St. James
Place, I believe it was,

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.070 align:middle line:90%
in Brooklyn.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there, by
the telephone booth,

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
you will find, on the
corner, my blood in the snow.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Beverly got up, ran down
the stairs, told her family.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.640 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, you're
crazy with grief.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:90%
We're not going.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Beverly hopped in the
car, family came with her.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.930 align:middle line:84%
George, she went to the place
where Tommy told her to go,

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:90%
St. James Place and Washington.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:47.087 align:middle line:84%
And there was blood in the snow,
exactly as Tommy had described.

00:20:47.087 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Beverly said, there's
the phone booth.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.032 align:middle line:84%
I could call the police and
say, hey, my son brought me a--

00:20:52.032 --> 00:20:53.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, and
there's blood here.

00:20:53.615 --> 00:20:54.415 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Yeah!

00:20:54.415 --> 00:20:56.470 align:middle line:90%
They'd think I was crazy.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Instead she said, I got an
anonymous tip, and here I am.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's true; I have
found blood in the snow.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:90%
They came out.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.162 align:middle line:90%
Police came out.

00:21:06.162 --> 00:21:07.870 align:middle line:84%
What was important
about that is not only

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:84%
did they find his blood, the
police, then, were able to go

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and they found eyewitnesses
to Tommy's murder,

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.780 align:middle line:90%
exactly how it happened.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:15.895 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.895 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Yes.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So instead of being a cold
case, they were able to open it.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.320 align:middle line:84%
But it all went back to
Tommy's visit with his mom.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think it is, energy?

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:90%
What is it, the other side?

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: The other side, it
is some form of consciousness,

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.550 align:middle line:90%
and I do believe it's energy.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And again, that goes back to
the study where I did work

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:84%
with families who were
here, who could give me

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:46.160 align:middle line:84%
evidence for how their loved
one was while they were alive.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And then they had had, since
then, so much contact with them

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and that people who
had the most energy

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.070 align:middle line:84%
seems to be able to
contact us easier.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.855 align:middle line:84%
Whereas people who
are very low energy,

00:21:57.855 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:84%
they haven't been
heard from by anyone.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Family members, friends--
no one has heard from them.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to be
energy, George.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.787 align:middle line:84%
And not that someone who's
low energy does not continue.

00:22:07.787 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:84%
It's just that maybe
it's difficult for them

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:90%
to contact us.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.750 align:middle line:84%
What do you recommend to
somebody who has lost someone?

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
How do they get
through this process?

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: The only
thing I recommend

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:90%
is, again, water, water, water.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Your body is so stressed out.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why does water help?

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Water
naturally just flushes out

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:90%
all those chemicals.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.363 align:middle line:84%
Like I've said earlier,
you've got these chemicals

00:22:30.363 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:90%
released in the brain.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And water, it goes
all through the body.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Water will just effortlessly
and naturally flush out

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:37.550 align:middle line:90%
those chemicals.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:90%
But then talk.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell you the
importance of support, George.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Find someone with whom you
can share your true thoughts

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and feelings-- really true
thoughts and feelings.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:90%
That helps so much.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.110 align:middle line:90%
See, grief is like a shirt.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.240 align:middle line:84%
If you put it in
the bottom drawer,

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
never bring it out, never wear
it, never show it to anyone,

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:90%
that shirt stays the same.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But the more you
bring it out, the more

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.139 align:middle line:84%
you share it, the more
you show it, the more you

00:23:02.139 --> 00:23:03.686 align:middle line:84%
present it around,
before you know

00:23:03.686 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:90%
it, what happens to that shirt?

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:90%
It wears out.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't fit, don't
need it anymore.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.849 align:middle line:90%
That's how grief is too.

00:23:09.849 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've got
some shirts at home

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:10%
that have never been unraveled.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.400 align:middle line:84%
They still have the pins
in there from the store.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any--

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I bought it, but I don't
have a need for it.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the
same way, isn't it?

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Just the same way.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.018 align:middle line:84%
It's just that--
it's that T-shirt.

00:23:27.018 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do
people go from here

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:84%
in terms of trying
to educate themselves

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.460 align:middle line:90%
about afterlife encounters?

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:10%
Because your work primarily is
for the living not the dead,

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.163 align:middle line:10%
correct?

00:23:42.163 --> 00:23:43.163 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: True, it is.

00:23:43.163 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:47.756 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where do people
go who just need help?

00:23:47.756 --> 00:23:48.880 align:middle line:90%
What do they do these days?

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there a counseling
center in every city?

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.140 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.848 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: There are
counseling centers.

00:23:54.848 --> 00:23:56.630 align:middle line:90%
There are grief support groups.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I would say if they want to find
out about afterlife encounters,

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.830 align:middle line:84%
please go to more
academic books.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
books out there

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:84%
that about people who really
just-- kind of the power ego

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.490 align:middle line:90%
thing and are not science based.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.760 align:middle line:84%
If they'll stay with
something science based,

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:84%
then they can get an idea of
what research has been done,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:84%
what do we know scientifically
about afterlife encounters.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Do we exist?

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Do we not exist?

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Why do afterlife
encounters happen?

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.510 align:middle line:84%
They can find out more if
they'll just stay first

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:90%
with the science-based books.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Should we
fear the afterlife?

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: George, I
am with a group of 50

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:90%
international researchers.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And my answer is no
based on not one of us

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.980 align:middle line:84%
has any kind of
frightening between worlds.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:55.305 align:middle line:84%
We don't have anything
like that in our in--

00:24:55.305 --> 00:24:56.619 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have you been lucky?

00:24:56.619 --> 00:24:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: [LAUGHS]
Someone told me,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:84%
said, well, you've
got this right spirit.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Your researchers have
this right spirit.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So nothing evil, nothing
trapped between worlds

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:90%
will come to any of you.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
the answer to that.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I am just lucky.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:84%
But we have not
had a single-- now,

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:84%
there have been people
who were frightened

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:90%
during their encounters.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I wrote
about this in the book

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84%
is that afterward
they said, what

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I realized is that there
was nothing to fear.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.150 align:middle line:90%
But my fear was, was me.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know-- they
didn't know what it was.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.750 align:middle line:90%
We fear the unknown.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.110 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what they
were, so they feared them

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.275 align:middle line:84%
But then later said, I
wish I hadn't done that.

00:25:36.275 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ever get
involved with anybody

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:10%
who is [WHISTLES] out
there hallucinating?

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.930 align:middle line:10%
And then how do you
bring them back home?

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I have
not been involved

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.513 align:middle line:90%
with anyone hallucinating.

00:25:46.513 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I worked as a psychotherapist
in a psych hospital.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:90%
And I found that--

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you've
seen all kinds.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.906 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I have
seen-- in fact,

00:25:52.906 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:84%
my specialty was
multiple personalities.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.544 align:middle line:10%
So the difference--

00:25:56.544 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do
you mean by that?

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:10%
Who said that?

00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.370 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: [LAUGHS]

00:25:59.370 --> 00:25:59.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'm a Gemini.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.240 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: [LAUGHS] That's it.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've had the natural
multiple personalities.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I've had--
hallucinations are frightening.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.150 align:middle line:90%
They're terrifying.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:11.780 align:middle line:84%
The person usually
needs to be sedated.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.113 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They believe it's real.

00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: They
believe it's real.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Whereas afterlife
encounters do not

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:23.404 align:middle line:84%
have that terrifying, just
kind of a schizophrenic type--

00:26:23.404 --> 00:26:24.320 align:middle line:90%
they're not like that.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:84%
They're very
different from that.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
something demonic?

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.330 align:middle line:90%
You never come across that?

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: We have ever
come across anything demonic,

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:84%
like I said, anything
trapped between worlds.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:84%
We've just-- it just
has not happened.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I worked
with Bill Rolle.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.274 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if that sounds--

00:26:39.274 --> 00:26:40.506 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've heard of him.

00:26:40.506 --> 00:26:40.733 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.733 --> 00:26:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL:
--longtime researcher,

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.110 align:middle line:90%
began early with JB Rhine.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:47.116 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they coined the
term "parapsychology."

00:26:47.116 --> 00:26:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: JB Rhine, at the
time, at Duke University.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: That's right,
at Duke University.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And they did a lot of studies
with poltergeists and things

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.460 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
they found mostly

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.550 align:middle line:84%
it was with someone
during a transition.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And so these things
were happening

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:12.850 align:middle line:84%
by their own cognitions rather
than an actual external event.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If you were speaking
before a group of people

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:10%
who were nonbelievers
in the afterlife,

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.940 align:middle line:10%
how would you convince
them otherwise?

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: George, I would
not try to convince anyone

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.760 align:middle line:90%
because I think we all--

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.610 align:middle line:90%
first of all, I love skeptics.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:84%
My whole work is
based on skeptics.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:84%
When a skeptic tells
me, that could not

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:84%
happen because, that's
when I sit up in my chair

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and I take notice
and I go full--

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:40.600 align:middle line:90%
I want to know.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You go right at them.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: I want to know.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to know why
they don't believe.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And to me, they are
my best friends.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.940 align:middle line:90%
They keep researchers honest.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.560 align:middle line:90%
They keep us on our toes.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And they have
presented me with--

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.660 align:middle line:84%
really all my research goes
back to the skeptics saying,

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.385 align:middle line:90%
that couldn't be.

00:27:57.385 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I say, OK, well, let
me research that and see.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.970 align:middle line:90%
So I love it.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
convince them otherwise?

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.175 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: I really don't.

00:28:04.175 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:90%
I just say, this is my evidence.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.550 align:middle line:84%
You can accept it if you
want, or you can not.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or you don't.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:09.926 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That's it.

00:28:09.926 --> 00:28:15.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is this a subject
where it's the individual--

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:20.176 align:middle line:10%
each individual has got to get
their answers for themselves?

00:28:20.176 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I
believe so, George.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I do believe this is something
for each individual to decide,

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.760 align:middle line:84%
each individual to
explore and accept it

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:33.100 align:middle line:84%
on his terms for however it
fits that person, so individual.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:10%
Just like grief,
it's so individual.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you
find that people who

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:10%
are more religious than others
are more apt to believe?

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: That's a
great question, more apt

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:90%
to believe if you're religious.

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:10%
And there have been
studies on that.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.320 align:middle line:10%
And the religious are
more apt to believe.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.470 align:middle line:10%
But one of the largest
surveys ever conducted

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.677 align:middle line:10%
was by the Bigelow
Holding Company.

00:28:55.677 --> 00:28:57.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was the afterlife events.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Or what was it?

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.470 align:middle line:84%
No, the-- now I can't
remember the name.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.680 align:middle line:84%
It was the largest
ever conducted ever

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was on any type of--

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.642 align:middle line:84%
Unusual Events was the name
of it, Unusual Events Survey.

00:29:08.642 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Supernatural events?

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That's right.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And from this study, they did
all-across cultural studies

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:20.330 align:middle line:84%
to see did it have anything
to do with age, with religion,

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:21.190 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And they found that
11% of Americans

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.160 align:middle line:84%
have had some type of
apparitional event.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Of those--

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
pretty good number.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.351 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: It's a good number.

00:29:31.351 --> 00:29:33.220 align:middle line:84%
More than 16% were
what in-- what

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:84%
they called the
specialized groups.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Specialized group meaning
they're more educated,

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.170 align:middle line:84%
they're wealthier, they're
more socially active,

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.880 align:middle line:90%
they're more politically active.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.680 align:middle line:90%
They have 2.5 children.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Figure that.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.014 align:middle line:90%


00:29:46.014 --> 00:29:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hate to be the 0.5.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: There you go.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:84%
But these are the
exceptional people.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.340 align:middle line:90%
So it seems like--

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't seem that religion
had anything to do with it.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.010 align:middle line:84%
But the really socially
active and intelligent-- more

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.159 align:middle line:84%
intelligent people have
more afterlife encounters.

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
interesting point.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: And if you
go and look online,

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.900 align:middle line:84%
type in for the
people who have had,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
you'll find yourself
with Winston Churchill,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:84%
with some really famous,
famous well-known,

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.170 align:middle line:84%
well-respected
international figures.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Miss Arcangel, if
people want more information

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.910 align:middle line:10%
on you, where do they go?

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:22.680 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL:
afterlifeencounters.com.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: Simple is that.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Hey, thanks for
being on the program.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Thank you, George.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.636 align:middle line:90%
It was a pleasure.

00:30:27.636 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hey, whether you
believe in the life after death

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.370 align:middle line:84%
or not, the big point
is and the question

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:84%
is, is one day you're
going to experience it,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.290 align:middle line:84%
whether a loved one passes
on or even you pass on.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:90%
So just be ready.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:56.770 align:middle line:90%


00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.590 align:middle line:84%
We need to give people
the information.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.102 align:middle line:90%
