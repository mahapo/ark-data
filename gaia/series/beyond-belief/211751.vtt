00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome to
this edition of Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.790 align:middle line:10%
Mark Stavish is with us, the
founder and director of studies

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:10%
at the Institute for
Hermetic Studies,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.572 align:middle line:10%
and the author of more than 20
books, Mark, on spirituality.

00:00:29.572 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK STAVISH: That's right.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.282 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
thank you very much.

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:35.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often did
you pump a book out?

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, it
seems like forever,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.040 align:middle line:84%
but, you know,
it's like anything.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:10%
Once you get going, traction
and momentum take over,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:10%
and you find you
have more to say.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Mark, what
is hermetic studies?

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:10%
>>STAVISH: Well, hermeticism is
what we think of as classical

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.520 align:middle line:10%
and Renaissance spirituality
rooted in the teachings

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Egypt.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.732 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not Hermes?

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Hermes, yes.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.109 align:middle line:90%
Hermes Trismegistus.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.442 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, what does it mean?

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, it
involves the study of-- it's

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.850 align:middle line:90%
really consciousness studies.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So you would study what they
did in the classical period

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
in the Renaissance, magic
or symbols, alchemy,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:84%
or the relationship of
mind and consciousness

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle line:84%
to matter, astrology,
the study of cycles

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and how they affect us, and
how we interact with them.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fantastic.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.985 align:middle line:84%
Pathology, spiritual pathology,
what would you say that is?

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It is a
natural effect of,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.682 align:middle line:84%
or byproduct of our engagement
with spiritual practices.

00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:90%
We have to be honest, George.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
No one comes to a
spiritual practice

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:84%
because they're happy with
themselves or their lives.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.352 align:middle line:84%
They're something
they want to change.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
missing something.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.893 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's right,
and they want to find it.

00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, often, they want to
find it outside themselves,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality should push
us deeper into ourselves.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So, as we go deeper, we will
engage or come in contact

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:84%
with those very
things within our self

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.660 align:middle line:84%
which are keeping us from,
well, having the life we want

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:84%
or having the
understandings we want.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.702 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you help
them find this, Mark?

00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, the
teachings at the Institute

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:90%
for Hermetic Studies do.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:90%
We have a course of study.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
It's online, and we
have live programs

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:84%
as well to help people traverse
this path from beginning

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:90%
to end, to know themselves.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How successful is it?

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, that
depends on who you ask.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a very
individual thing.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And it takes place
gradually and over stages.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as if someone's
going to come in and become

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.320 align:middle line:90%
instantly enlightened.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
pathological ideas

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
that we encounter now
in spiritual practice,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that things are going to be fast
and easy and happen instantly.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people recognize
the fact that they need help,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.555 align:middle line:84%
or they need some
change in their life?

00:02:49.555 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think they
recognize it early,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:90%
I think we all do.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:84%
But we have trouble
voicing it, and we don't

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:90%
know where to go for help.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So, when we're feeling
physically ill,

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of easy
to go to a doctor.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
When we're feeling kind
of emotionally upset,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.138 align:middle line:84%
it may or may not be as
easy to go to a therapist.

00:03:09.138 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
looking for something

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:84%
of a spiritual nature,
it can be very confusing

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
because there's
so much out there.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
books, so many videos.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So wide.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: It's so wide.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to be a
believer in God to be happy?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: I don't believe so.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.383 align:middle line:84%
And I say that just so that
the viewers understand--

00:03:27.383 --> 00:03:29.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a
however coming up here.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's right
there is a however.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
There's an aspect of what we
call metaphysical atheism,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:84%
and what that means
is we don't really

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.110 align:middle line:84%
talk about or say for
certain whether there's

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
a creator deity like in
Christianity or Judaism

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:90%
or Islam.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:84%
But we are open to
this idea that there's

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:90%
vast spiritual forces out there.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's not not believing
in God, this form of atheism

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't be confused
with materialism.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: You can't
be a materialist

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and be on a
spiritual path there.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has technology helped
magnify spiritual problems

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.518 align:middle line:90%
or fix them?

00:04:01.518 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's the
beauty of technology,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:90%
it magnifies everything.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So, while it's made it easier
for us to engage people, like

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
you and I to speak and come
together and with the audience,

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:84%
it also has magnified
the problems

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.897 align:middle line:84%
because people feel often more
isolated than ever before.

00:04:17.897 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about
the hermetic practitioner,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.175 align:middle line:90%
Bob Smith.

00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Bob
Smith was a fellow

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that we had at a recent
Institute for Hermetic Studies

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:90%
conference.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And his specialty
is the teachings

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:84%
of Franz Bardon who is
a Czech hermeticist, who

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:84%
wasn't terribly well known
outside of Czechoslovakia

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
or German-speaking countries
until like the '80s or '90s.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And, in the last few
years, interest in his work

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:90%
has taken off considerably.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And Bob took the
teachings of Franz Bardon

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and worked with what we
think of as the study

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:90%
of the outer planets.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.218 align:middle line:90%
In astrology--

00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:54.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:55.185 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yeah.

00:04:55.185 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And everyone knows we deal with
the moon, the sun, mercury,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:90%
and all of this--

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.618 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: --on a
day to day basis,

00:05:01.618 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
what we call the
classical seven planets.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:84%
We don't do a lot
with the outer three.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And what he did is
engaged in some kind

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:84%
of visionary practices, what we
call psychic or astral travel,

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
mental travel, to
attempt to ascertain what

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:90%
goes on in those dimensions.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
at some of his work, Mark.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BOB SMITH: It turns
out this generates

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.730 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit of mental and oddly
some astral energy, which is

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.966 align:middle line:90%
normally generated by breath.

00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And since you're using
empowered crystal for that,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.960 align:middle line:90%
that's a little weird.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure where that's going.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it's designed
for manifestation.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is a production
version of one of four stages.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:84%
The initial stage
device, pretty safe.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Worst case, if you
work with it, you

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:84%
might get a bad state
at the end of the day.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:84%
The stage 2 device is
powered by Tesla coil.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, stage 3 device is
powered by Tesla coil.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And it left me with surface
burns on three fingers.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Not sure yet how to
dummy proof that item.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So people don't blind
themselves or cause

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.755 align:middle line:84%
themselves other degrees of
harm, but it seems to work.

00:06:16.755 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Have given these
devices to a number

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:84%
of senior qigong
practitioners, half of them

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:84%
don't feel a thing initially,
which is kind of weird.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:84%
If they play with it for about
an hour a day for about a week,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that sensory apparatus
seems to turn on with them,

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:90%
and they like it.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I've given it to a couple of
high-end remote work people who

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:90%
work for various governments.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Same number 50/50, half of
them loved the damn thing

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and got really good
results from it.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:90%
The other half, got bunkers.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it's
the power of suggestion.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
something true there.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
But our ability to measure
whatever it's producing

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:90%
doesn't seem to be very--

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He seemed
to imply, Mark,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that technology may
have backfired on him

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.860 align:middle line:90%
and hurt him a little bit.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Did you pick that up?

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes, definitely.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is not the
first time when we've

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:90%
heard of something like this.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the notion of
interacting with technology

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:84%
for various psychic phenomena
or healing practices,

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:90%
we find because of--

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
one, is we don't have
a lot of information

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
on it, so we really
are flying blind.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.265 align:middle line:84%
So, as we experiment
with it and trying

00:07:32.265 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
to find out from what
I'm hearing from people

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.030 align:middle line:84%
are doing is, again, it
doesn't have the same controls.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:90%
Half the people had effects.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:90%
The other half had nothing.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
those who do have it,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:84%
is it going to be positive,
or is it going to be negative?

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And in his case, of course,
he said second-degree burns

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.293 align:middle line:90%
on two fingers of his hand.

00:07:52.293 --> 00:07:53.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not good.

00:07:53.335 --> 00:07:54.252 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's not.

00:07:54.252 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So, when we look at
amplifying the energy

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:84%
load of an undertaking,
a psychic or metaphysical

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
undertaking, we have to realize
that our nervous system may not

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.730 align:middle line:90%
be up to that task.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What can you tell
us about Rudolf Steiner?

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, Steiner was
an Austrian metaphysician.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.170 align:middle line:90%
He was an author.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
He wrote many books,
small monographs.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:84%
He was quite popular
in the early years

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century, and now,
he seemed to have had a revival.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And he founded an organization
known as the Anthroposophical

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Society, and it was a breakaway
group from the Theosophical

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:90%
Society.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:84%
Most of his work is based
on his own visionary

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:90%
or psychic experiences.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I find it at times difficult
to understand, however,

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
only because of the
language of the time.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he
good at what he did?

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I
believe he was good,

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and I believe he is worth study.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was how I
was going to qualify

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:84%
it is that, if you
spend some time with it,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that he
does have a great deal

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.910 align:middle line:90%
to offer in terms of insights.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And some of his writings are
particularly relevant to today,

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and they saw a bit of revival
over the last three years,

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what is the impact
of technology on society.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And are we deadening ourselves,
in many ways, from the ability

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:90%
to even have--

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We might be.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.695 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: --psychic
experiences.

00:09:14.695 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We might be.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And its cognitive
capacity, what is that?

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Because that seems to be waning.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, it's just,
really, the ability to think.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.205 align:middle line:90%
One of the things that I--

00:09:26.205 --> 00:09:27.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it on the decline?

00:09:27.455 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I
definitely believe so,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.878 align:middle line:84%
and I think there are studies
out there that show it.

00:09:30.878 --> 00:09:31.702 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:09:31.702 --> 00:09:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: In short,
maybe too much media

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.400 align:middle line:90%
time, too much screen time.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:84%
The focusing of our
minds, particularly

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
on handheld devices and
screens in front of us,

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:84%
focuses our mind
in a particular way

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:84%
that studies have
shown rewire our brain.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.677 align:middle line:84%
It changes the way we perceive
ourselves, perceive others,

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:54.760 align:middle line:90%
and then the way we think.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You go to the airport
and look at people sitting,

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
waiting for a
flight, 90% of them

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:84%
are on their smartphones,
90% of them, maybe more.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I did that when I
was sitting there in Chicago

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:90%
waiting for my connection.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I looked around,
and I counted off

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:84%
how many people were
on their screens

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.060 align:middle line:90%
and how many were reading books.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.794 align:middle line:90%
Remember, there was a time--

00:10:16.794 --> 00:10:18.211 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
would bring books.

00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yeah.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to those days?

00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:23.265 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, let's
try and bring them back.

00:10:23.265 --> 00:10:24.973 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but
what happened to them?

00:10:24.973 --> 00:10:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: I think it's ease.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:31.990 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to pull out your
phone and look at the screen.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And, in that ease,
it's easy to fall

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.400 align:middle line:84%
into just the habit of
always checking your status,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:90%
always checking.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is convenient.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Very much so.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.082 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if I want
to know who Mark Stavish is,

00:10:43.082 --> 00:10:45.710 align:middle line:84%
you just Google
him, and it pops up.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.955 align:middle line:84%
Now, 15, 20 years ago,
we couldn't do that.

00:10:50.955 --> 00:10:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, again,
everything is a--

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:90%
we have to weigh it out.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at technology
or even spiritual practices,

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:84%
we have to assess, over time
from our engagement with them,

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:90%
is this helping me?

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Is this hindering me?

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Is this the right amount,
or is it too much?

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it dangerous?

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.365 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: The technology?

00:11:15.365 --> 00:11:16.165 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:11:16.165 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think
definitely so,

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and not the technology itself,
but how we're engaging with it.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's the same with
a lot of spiritual practice.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Most of the practices in and
of themselves aren't dangerous,

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.340 align:middle line:84%
it's how people
engage with them.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:90%
And that needs to be very clear.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost too
much of a good thing

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:90%
turns a virtue into a vice.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you
weigh the possible dangers

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:90%
of paranormal research?

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.705 align:middle line:90%
Could that be a problem?

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: One of the things
that I found out over the years

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
is that people want
a new experience.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And they want to experience
the invisible, that

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:84%
which is not of their physical
experience, their day to day.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And they will engage
in paranormal research

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.418 align:middle line:84%
or what passes for
it, particularly ghost

00:12:06.418 --> 00:12:07.710 align:middle line:90%
hunting and that type of thing.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And they do
it without any really

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.963 align:middle line:84%
understanding what they
may be encountering.

00:12:12.963 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
doing it for fun.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: For fun.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
problem comes in.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.392 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can it backfire?

00:12:18.392 --> 00:12:19.309 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Definitely.

00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, you
look at what goes on

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.660 align:middle line:84%
in many of the shows
or many of the reports,

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and people will attempt
to go find a ghost.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Now, why does a ghost happen?

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.533 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
classical literature,

00:12:30.533 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:84%
if we look at
traditional studies,

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:84%
it's usually a person
or a group of people,

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:84%
but a person who has
unresolved emotional issues.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So, in short, they're
probably angry.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
they're not happy about,

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and they're sticking
around for whatever reason.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For whatever reason.

00:12:47.645 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So,
now, ask yourself,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.410 align:middle line:84%
would you want to
engage with this person

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.700 align:middle line:90%
when they were alive?

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Probably not.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So why do you
want to engage with them now

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.390 align:middle line:90%
when they're dead?

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's even worse.

00:12:59.025 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's right, because
you don't know what they can

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:90%
or cannot do to you.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.570 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the background
to protect yourself

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:09.665 align:middle line:90%
from their aggression.

00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What should we do?

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.305 align:middle line:90%
Back off?

00:13:12.305 --> 00:13:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think that
we should encourage

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:84%
responsible studies,
and that would

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:84%
be by linking
paranormal research,

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:90%
even if it's unofficial.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.017 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
the big corporate stuff

00:13:24.017 --> 00:13:25.850 align:middle line:84%
or the government stuff
or stuff that's done

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:90%
in academia but as individuals.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that our
paranormal research

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:84%
is done within the framework
of some traditional spiritual

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:84%
practices, where they
have a place for it.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stanley Zurek.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.565 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about him.

00:13:40.565 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Stan is a great guy.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And he's done a lot of research
in Northeastern Pennsylvania

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.790 align:middle line:90%
on a phenomenon known as Suscon.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:48.590 align:middle line:90%
And every place--

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's a
paranormal author, right?

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's right.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.740 align:middle line:90%
He's a paranormal author.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And every area in the
country or the world

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
has some place
like Suscon, where

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:90%
strange phenomena take place.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And, over time, it
builds into legend,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to take
a look at that and say,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:90%
is there any truth to it?

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:90%
And he collected these legends.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:90%
He did his own research.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
He tells us what the stories
are of the locations, what

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.590 align:middle line:90%
is said to have happened there.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:18.630 align:middle line:84%
You can even find it
with GPS, and that's it.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
He is a fellow who
tells you where

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.718 align:middle line:84%
to go if you want to test
the legend of Suscon.

00:14:23.718 --> 00:14:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of his
stories has to do

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
with a ghost with a flashlight
and a phenomenon known

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:90%
as residual haunting.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STANLEY ZUREK: You
walk up to the woods,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:90%
they go in with a flashlight.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.752 align:middle line:84%
They're looking around
the woods, the flashlight,

00:14:35.752 --> 00:14:39.380 align:middle line:84%
a couple of times, and somebody
flashlight's back at you.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you might see
this girl moving around

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:90%
in the woods.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you might
hear somebody yell,

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:90%
"Please help me."

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Just a little
area, and this area

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.235 align:middle line:84%
is maybe 200 yards big
now, that's about it.

00:14:52.235 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Not a big area right
now because it's getting

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:90%
developed up there.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:84%
But this girl is
screaming for help,

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:84%
someone come get
her and help her.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of people say,
spirits, ghosts, right?

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.150 align:middle line:90%
This might be a residual.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:84%
If you're not sure
what a residual is,

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:84%
it's like a tape recorded over
and over and over again, not

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:90%
a true haunting.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
A true haunting means you're
going to have interaction

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:90%
with something.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Residual means like--

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll use Gettysburg
as an example.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.173 align:middle line:84%
You go to Gettysburg, the
soldiers are still fighting.

00:15:22.173 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're lucky enough
when you're down there,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:84%
you might just catch the
soldiers coming out fighting.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
You might go there next year
soldiers come out fighting

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:90%
basically the same area.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:84%
They do the same thing over
and over and over again.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Not a true haunting,
it's called residual.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
True haunting would be, if
they're walking down the street

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and they look at you and
they say, "How you doing?"

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.248 align:middle line:84%
That means they interact
with you, right,

00:15:44.248 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:84%
which some people claim
that's what happened down

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:90%
in Gettysburg.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.443 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did he
get all these stories?

00:15:49.443 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well,
he's a local guy.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.878 align:middle line:84%
He lives out there, he heard
them growing up as a child.

00:15:53.878 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're great stories.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.378 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: They're fantastic.

00:15:56.378 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And guys like Stan are
really the heartbeat

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
of good folklore, of
good anthropology,

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:90%
of good psychic research.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you could tell
he enjoys what he's doing.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.398 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: He loves it.

00:16:08.398 --> 00:16:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And, once he gets rolling,
he's just great to listen to.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What, Mark, is called
the trickster phenomenon?

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: The trickster
phenomena is a experience

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:90%
that many people have.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to describe
it is, well, the gods

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:90%
are scoundrels.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not all gods.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yeah.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what is it that
seems to go wrong or go sideways

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:84%
in different types
of psychic research?

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And can you trust
the information

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:90%
you get from the invisible?

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.205 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you?

00:16:47.205 --> 00:16:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, as
Ronald Reagan said,

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:90%
"trust but verify."

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.432 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:51.432 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: You got to have
a grain of alchemical salt

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.010 align:middle line:84%
with almost everything that
comes from the invisible.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.715 align:middle line:84%
And history tends
to bear this out,

00:16:58.715 --> 00:17:00.090 align:middle line:84%
particularly if
you see those who

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:90%
engage in on a regular basis.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And George Hansen wrote a
book called, The Trickster

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and the Paranormal, which should
be required reading for anyone

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:84%
engaging in this stuff
because he shows how

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.230 align:middle line:84%
regular engagement in
the invisible, pulling

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:84%
the psychic dimensions
regularly into our lives

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
can cause a high
degree of disruption.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your life?

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: In your life.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.829 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Now there's also a phenomena
called the phenomena buddy.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.692 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Phenomena
buddy is someone

00:17:31.692 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:90%
who helps keep you sane.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.593 align:middle line:90%
This is someone--

00:17:34.593 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everybody
should have one?

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: At least one.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is you become
like the people you

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:90%
spend most of your time with.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And you want to spend your
time with people, particularly

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
if you're engaging in
spiritual practices

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
or paranormal research
even, that have

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:90%
a good head on their shoulders.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to help you
question your understanding

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.730 align:middle line:90%
of an experience.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of
like my great uncle

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.780 align:middle line:90%
used to say when I was a kid.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I remember him saying referring
back to the '20s and '30s,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.435 align:middle line:84%
he said, "well, spiritualism
was all the rage."

00:18:08.435 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The good old days.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: The good old days.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.480 align:middle line:90%
It's all the rage.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said one of
the problems was

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.015 align:middle line:84%
a truck goes down the street,
it rattles the chandelier.

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
You know people had
chandeliers then.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And
the person thinks,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.960 align:middle line:84%
"This is the masters,"
the great adept trying

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:90%
to communicate to them.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
communicating with us.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: That's right.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And, no, they're not, it's a
truck going down the street.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's part
of the pathology.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to begin to look at
every encounter in your life

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
as having deep meaning,
and it probably doesn't.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's learning to
perceive reality as it is.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And your phenomena
buddy is someone

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:84%
who kind of has a mental
rope around you to keep you

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:51.870 align:middle line:90%
from going off the edge.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they ground you?

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: They help ground you.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you have
a phenomena buddy who

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:90%
is not grounded himself?

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.823 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Then
you're in trouble.

00:18:59.823 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That
happens, doesn't it?

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think more
often than not because people

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:84%
are going into a metaphysical
group, psychic research

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:84%
group, spiritual
practice, they may not

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.330 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of
experience themselves

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:90%
or a good background.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And, well, birds of a
feather flock together,

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
so it's easier to
find someone who is

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:90%
ungrounded than it is grounded.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So you just have to pick
your fellow practitioners

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.790 align:middle line:90%
very carefully.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think of
the UFO phenomena these days?

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think it's
really pretty stunning

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:84%
because, on one hand, I
can't tell you what it is,

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:90%
whether it's extraterrestrial.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean I have my own views that
it's probably interdimensional.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.383 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
people think that.

00:19:48.383 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think
that's probably

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:84%
a safer bet just
based on what it would

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.960 align:middle line:90%
take to travel through space.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I think,
over the years,

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
they've developed a way
to bend space and time.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:90%
That's my take.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And that
very well may be.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
What I find
interesting, though, is

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:84%
that, if we take the
headlines that we've

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.550 align:middle line:84%
seen over the last
three years, we

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.520 align:middle line:84%
can go and find
almost exact headlines

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:90%
from 30, 40, and 50 years ago.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.523 align:middle line:84%
And there really hasn't
been a lot of revelation.

00:20:20.523 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there really hasn't.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:84%
We haven't had anyone
come out and point

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.570 align:middle line:84%
to this craft and
these materials

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:84%
that have supposed to
have been collected

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:90%
and say, "This is it."

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.520 align:middle line:84%
We hear about it, but
we're not being shown--

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: --the
thing itself, the it,

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:90%
that which will clinch the deal.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they don't
have it, maybe they do.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think the
way it's being approached

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:55.070 align:middle line:84%
is, as Jacques Vallee said it
is a social control mechanism.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He might be right.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.940 align:middle line:90%
He might be right.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:90%
What about mindfulness?

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:90%
How does that work into this?

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:10%
>>STAVISH: Mindfulness
is a term that

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.320 align:middle line:10%
has become very popular
over the last decade or so.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:10%
And it simply means paying
attention to what you're doing,

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:10%
be aware of what you're
doing, of your environment,

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:10%
and of what's going on.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And even your reaction, that's
the other part of mindfulness,

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
being aware of your responses
and your reactions to things.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And our reaction would be
something which is habituated.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.080 align:middle line:90%
It's very quick.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.617 align:middle line:90%
It's a habit.

00:21:39.617 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
A response is something where
we take a little more time

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:90%
and think about it.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:84%
But pay attention so that you
can begin to know yourself

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.040 align:middle line:84%
through these
experiences and know

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:84%
your relationship to
the inner and the outer,

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:90%
the as above so below.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness, that
paying attention,

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.133 align:middle line:90%
that is the basis of it all.

00:21:59.133 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say, Mark,

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:05.620 align:middle line:84%
is probably the most
compelling aspect of your work

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.320 align:middle line:84%
that you would love the
public to understand?

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That you are
responsible for your own life

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and your own
direction, and that you

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:84%
can come to know and
understand yourself.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And, in that, understand
that any spiritual practice

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:84%
you undertake should be
good for you in this life.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It should have some positive
benefit for you in this life.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And it should also
have a benefit for you

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:84%
in the hereafter,
whatever that may be.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever that may be.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yes, because
different schools of thought

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:90%
have different ideas.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Some believe in a
variety of heavens.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Some believe in reincarnation.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Some believe in both.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.760 align:middle line:84%
But the practices
which you undertake,

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.400 align:middle line:84%
you need to know that they're
going to be of value to you

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:90%
in the long run.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
to where you are today?

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Thinking the way you think?

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.770 align:middle line:84%
20-plus books,
that's magnificent.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.297 align:middle line:90%
How did you get there?

00:23:05.297 --> 00:23:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I've
always had an interest

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:90%
in the spiritual dimension.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And, as I mentioned
earlier, my great uncle,

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I grew up around people who
were deeply involved in this.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:84%
He was involved with many
of the esoteric movements

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:24.030 align:middle line:84%
of the early 20th
century and even earlier.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So I've always been
around it, and I've

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:84%
always been very fortunate to
be around people with good heads

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:84%
on their shoulders
and, through that,

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:38.400 align:middle line:84%
exposed to people who practiced
very traditional teachings.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When somebody comes
to you for help and assistance,

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:44.300 align:middle line:90%
what do they want to learn?

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.278 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:23:46.278 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, when
they want assistance,

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.040 align:middle line:84%
they usually want a
solution to a problem.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And, very often, even when we
say, what do want to learn,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.830 align:middle line:84%
they don't really
want to learn much.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:84%
What they want is a
solution to a problem.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take a look
at what that problem,

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.460 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's usually
something very common,

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and try to point them
in a direction that's

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:90%
going to be more inward.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:10%
That you have to come
to know who you are,

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.270 align:middle line:10%
how this problem came to be,
what your responsibilities are,

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:10%
and what you need to do to
change yourself for the better.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it changeable?

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think
most things are.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.565 align:middle line:84%
And I think, well,
everything over time

00:24:21.565 --> 00:24:23.503 align:middle line:84%
is, it's just a matter
of whether people

00:24:23.503 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:84%
are willing to put the
time and the effort in.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we make
ourselves equal to God?

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's taken
from the Corpus Hermeticum.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And what it means is to get
rid of all of our limited self

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.040 align:middle line:84%
concepts, to open yourself
up to all the possibilities

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:90%
that were within us.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
We hear that in a
variety of teachings

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.590 align:middle line:84%
over and over and
over again, that we

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.920 align:middle line:84%
are made in the image of God, or
that we are gods in miniature,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:90%
something to this effect.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
we begin to realize

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that is to think of
what we are and what

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.670 align:middle line:84%
we are capable of,
even in potential,

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.280 align:middle line:84%
rather than what we are not
or what we see ourselves

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.270 align:middle line:90%
not being.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, here's
a great question.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:90%
What are the mind parasites?

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Oh, that's
a great phrase.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's from a book
written by Colin Wilson.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't read any
of Colin Wilson's works,

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get to a
library and read some.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:90%
He's a great writer

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of mind parasites.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And he wrote a book
called The Mind Parasites.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a short novel,
and it has to do

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:29.180 align:middle line:84%
with this idea, which is really
relevant to our time now.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we
believe that there's

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.560 align:middle line:84%
a variety of visible
and invisible forces.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of them we think are
helpful to us, some of them--

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some not.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: --we think not so.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.305 align:middle line:84%
The parasites are the ones
that aren't so helpful to us.

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They attach.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's
right, like a parasite.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Leeches.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Now these parasites,
to have an influence,

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.300 align:middle line:84%
don't have to influence
or control everybody,

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:84%
they just have to influence
or control the right person.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So the mind parasite is
that force of, we'll say,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:84%
negation or destruction
that's going to say,

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:84%
I want to create
the most disruption

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:90%
in this neighborhood.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.040 align:middle line:90%
Who can it be?

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, it could be
the local clergyman.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.850 align:middle line:90%
It could be the local teacher.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:13.933 align:middle line:90%
It could be a businessman.

00:26:13.933 --> 00:26:16.225 align:middle line:84%
I want to create the most
disruption in this community,

00:26:16.225 --> 00:26:17.025 align:middle line:90%
who could it be?

00:26:17.025 --> 00:26:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Could be the mayor.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.700 align:middle line:90%
And it works its way up.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So the more influence you
have on others, in business,

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:84%
in religion, in politics,
and media, in some respects,

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:32.390 align:middle line:84%
the more open you are to being a
target of these mind parasites.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Now I just want to say the
opposite is true as well.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:84%
The greater potential you
have for those things which

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.160 align:middle line:84%
want to help us as
well, help us and grow.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a lot
of talk these days, Mark,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.270 align:middle line:84%
about artificial intelligence,
that it could destroy humanity.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Are you a believer in that?

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, if you had
asked me this question a month

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.590 align:middle line:84%
ago, the answer I
would have given

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:84%
you would be very
different from the one

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:56.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to give you now.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What made that change?

00:26:58.030 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It was
just some articles

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
that friends had sent me
before I came the other day.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And I read them, and
it's just the speed

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:84%
with which artificial
intelligence is developing.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I asked some questions
about myself and people

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:18.195 align:middle line:84%
I knew a month ago, and most
of the answers were wrong.

00:27:18.195 --> 00:27:18.995 align:middle line:90%
It was inaccurate.

00:27:18.995 --> 00:27:19.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:27:19.795 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Mm-hmm.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.020 align:middle line:84%
the one search said,
I didn't even exist,

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.850 align:middle line:90%
but then it learned.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.833 align:middle line:84%
In a few minutes later,
I came into being

00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:90%
for artificial intelligence.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.167 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That you were here.

00:27:30.167 --> 00:27:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: I was here.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So artificial intelligence
is problematic

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:84%
because it only can tell
us what it has access to.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Now that means it can be
very beneficial for answering

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.880 align:middle line:84%
basic questions
about basic ideas.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But from what I understand,
it's learning very quickly.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On its own.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And from
what I understand,

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
even people involved in
it don't really understand

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.570 align:middle line:90%
how that process is happening.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it scare them?

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: It appears to, but
they don't seem scared enough

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:90%
to want to stop the experiment.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't
stop, it's like a fix.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.615 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: I believe so.

00:28:07.615 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want to see
how far they can take it.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: How far will it go?

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part that, I
wouldn't say it worries me,

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
but it is a concern
because, what

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:84%
is the spread and reach of
this artificial intelligence?

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know enough
about technology.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And if the folks involved in it
tell me they're afraid of it--

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and I've had a few, some really
smart PhD-level computer people

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.190 align:middle line:84%
tell me they're really
concerned about it.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Jobs and everything else, right?

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And people I
know personally, they've

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.900 align:middle line:90%
said this frightens them.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: CEO of a company
just recently laid

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.840 align:middle line:84%
off 90% of his staff
because he said

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.850 align:middle line:90%
automation has replaced you.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:50.800 align:middle line:90%
90%.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And then
what do they do?

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.767 align:middle line:90%
What happens to these 90--

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where do they go?

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Where do they go?

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:57.480 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the big question.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So if we make people
disposable, we

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.810 align:middle line:84%
run putting ourselves in
a very dangerous track.

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you've heard
this talk of driverless trucks.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to be in front
of a driverless truck

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:84%
in the dead of winter with
snow all over the place?

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: No.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want a truck
driver who's got experience

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and knows what
he's doing, or she.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Exactly.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's where
it goes too far.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: We're
trying to make people,

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:84%
not only interchangeable,
but now replaceable.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is the problem with
artificial intelligence,

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:84%
that within the spiritual
dimension, we see--

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:84%
in Japan, there's
occasional robots

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.930 align:middle line:84%
that will take on
the role of a priest.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a spouse.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:50.375 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Or spouse, yeah.

00:29:50.375 --> 00:29:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Or spouse, that's even stranger.

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:84%
The priest is
interesting because you

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.360 align:middle line:90%
can ask your questions.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, if it has
the right information,

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.370 align:middle line:90%
it can give you basic answers.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.870 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
same as an experience.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:06.440 align:middle line:84%
I can't rely on
that robot priest

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.750 align:middle line:84%
to be able to help me
with my experiences

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.720 align:middle line:84%
because it hasn't
experienced the path.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not sentient.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.740 align:middle line:84%
How can we learn from
artificial intelligence

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.150 align:middle line:90%
and not be afraid of it?

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think we need
to simply keep it simple.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:30.350 align:middle line:84%
We need to realize that it has
limits and not to rely on it.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:37.370 align:middle line:84%
As we see within weeks,
and I mean two weeks here,

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:41.450 align:middle line:90%
when AI seem to break into--

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explode.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: --explode
into the headlines.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:49.760 align:middle line:84%
We saw on teaching platforms--
because my wife is a teacher--

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:56.480 align:middle line:84%
of instructors, how can we use
AI to write our lesson plans?

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Now I understand that
you want a little help,

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:84%
but you have to be the
master of your subject.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we're seeing--

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have to
be the driving force.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: The
driving force, yes.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And you need to have mastery
of the subject matter

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.830 align:middle line:90%
to be the driving force.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing is, whether
it's with excessive screen time

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:21.350 align:middle line:84%
or ease of accessibility,
now the notion

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:84%
that I really don't
have to know anything,

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I just have to ask the
question and something

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:90%
will tell me something.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It'll tell
me, and just let it be.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Mm-hmm

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary though.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.855 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Right,
because what we

00:31:33.855 --> 00:31:37.730 align:middle line:84%
see with it is a decline
in cognitive ability,

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:42.950 align:middle line:84%
in the ability to solve
problems, well, recognize

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:48.387 align:middle line:84%
problems as well, and in the
ability to engage in practice.

00:31:48.387 --> 00:31:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will AI
ever get to the point

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.940 align:middle line:84%
where it'll understand
spirituality?

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That I
can't answer because I

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.510 align:middle line:90%
don't know about the cognition.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:84%
That is what they call
that unification, where

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.680 align:middle line:90%
it becomes self-aware.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.880 align:middle line:84%
That I don't know
if it's possible.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.770 align:middle line:84%
There are some
theories, and again, I

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:84%
place this as theories,
that that may be possible,

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.030 align:middle line:84%
but it really wouldn't be
the AI becoming self-aware.

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.300 align:middle line:84%
It would be the
technology being hijacked,

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.720 align:middle line:84%
basically possessed by some
invisible force or entity.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
afraid of robots?

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: No, I'm just afraid
of what people do with them.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
a Twilight Zone

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:84%
episode called, I Sing the
Body Electric by Ray Bradbury,

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:90%
he wrote it.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I did an editorial about it, and
he sent me a great letter years

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.170 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I got it on my
bulletin board at work.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But it was about a family
who lost their mother, two

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.640 align:middle line:90%
little kids, father.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.200 align:middle line:84%
She died, and they were
despondent and rightfully so.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And the father said, "We're
going to get a nanny for you,"

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and they went to the robot
store and just bought one.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.460 align:middle line:90%
And the nanny raised the kids.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.930 align:middle line:84%
They became adults, and it
ended with the nanny going

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to another family of two
little youngsters, where

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.380 align:middle line:84%
the adults hugged her and
kissed her and said goodbye,

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:90%
and life went on.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it'll
ever be that way?

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think
it's possible.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's desirable
or not is another story,

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:24.140 align:middle line:90%
but I do think it's possible.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And from what I have heard
from people who work there

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and from what I have
read, there seems

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:35.050 align:middle line:84%
to be a large group of people
in what we call Silicon

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Valley, who are quite obsessed.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
vehement with this stuff.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: With not only
technology, but also

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.220 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
transfer consciousness

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.430 align:middle line:84%
into technology, which is
another questionable idea

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is they
believe it, and I

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:90%
think that's what's important.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.060 align:middle line:84%
When we get into these ideas,
it's not whether we believe it

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.400 align:middle line:84%
or not, is that someone else
may or someone else does.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, have you seen
some of the physical attributes

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.350 align:middle line:90%
of these robots?

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Yes.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're scary-looking.

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:10.830 align:middle line:84%
They blink, they turn
their head, they listen.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:14.639 align:middle line:84%
They open their eyes up
like that, it's weird.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Yes,
and I watched one

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:20.920 align:middle line:90%
about two or three days ago.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.670 align:middle line:84%
What I find fascinating about
it is it really very much

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:26.780 align:middle line:90%
is a kind of seduction.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.000 align:middle line:84%
That is the robot
is being designed

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:37.070 align:middle line:84%
to be as lifelike as possible
so that we forget that it is not

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:41.000 align:middle line:84%
human, so that we don't
even recognize that anymore.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:84%
What do you recommend to
people who want to learn more

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.489 align:middle line:90%
about what you do?

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:47.989 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Best
thing for them to do

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:52.739 align:middle line:84%
is to just Google
me or go to Amazon,

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:56.429 align:middle line:84%
look up some of our work,
our books under Mark Stavish.

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: S-T-A-V-I-S-H.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Correct.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:03.960 align:middle line:10%
Or they can go to the Institute
for Hermetic Studies website.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:10%
They also can find us, we have
a lot of courses on Teachable.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.590 align:middle line:10%
And my email will
pop up in any search.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.140 align:middle line:10%
Just please feel
free to contact me.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:17.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If you had
to talk about an area

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.530 align:middle line:10%
that you haven't tackled
yet in your career

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:23.250 align:middle line:10%
but you would like to,
what would that be?

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Oh, there's so many.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that getting
folks to really understand

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:35.730 align:middle line:84%
the necessity of taking their
spiritual practice seriously

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:84%
without it impacting
negatively on a heavy way

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.850 align:middle line:84%
in their daily life
and recognizing

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:47.410 align:middle line:84%
that their purpose
of these practices

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.630 align:middle line:90%
is to become self-aware.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.102 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
aren't spiritual, Mark?

00:35:52.102 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: I think that,
when we look at the numbers,

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:84%
it probably doesn't
change a lot.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:59.170 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
1% or a fraction

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.480 align:middle line:84%
of a percent that are
involved in what we would call

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.940 align:middle line:90%
very significant practices.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.040 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
another 4% or 5%

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.850 align:middle line:84%
that are involved in tangential,
and then we see probably 30%

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:84%
to 40% or 50% that are
involved in what we think of as

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.400 align:middle line:90%
mainstream religious practices.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Probably one of the greatest
problems we face right

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:84%
now is the spiritual but
not religious category.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:23.775 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: And the
reason I say that is

00:36:23.775 --> 00:36:27.910 align:middle line:84%
because, without any guidelines
that traditional practice

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:33.340 align:middle line:84%
brings, you don't have
any way of vetting

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.930 align:middle line:90%
the source of your information.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Where does this come from?

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:39.960 align:middle line:90%
How do I do it?

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.240 align:middle line:84%
What can I expect
from the practices?

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And who are the
examples you give

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:49.020 align:middle line:84%
of maybe not 100%
successful but at least

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.700 align:middle line:84%
where I can see
the path of success

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.210 align:middle line:90%
is happening that's unfolding?

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to
believe in God to be spiritual?

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: No, but
it probably helps.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.950 align:middle line:90%
You have to--

00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Well, many people
have trouble with the Buddhist

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.420 align:middle line:84%
view of what we call
metaphysical atheism,

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.740 align:middle line:84%
where you're open to
these possibilities,

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:13.050 align:middle line:84%
but you don't really have a
creator-deity that you look to.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So, if you can't handle
that kind of ambiguity,

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:20.640 align:middle line:84%
it's really very good to believe
that there is a focal point

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.800 align:middle line:84%
or force of
intelligence out there

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and power, which they're
inseparable at that point, that

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:30.810 align:middle line:84%
has somehow initiated a process
that has brought all of this

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.940 align:middle line:84%
into being of which we are a
part of because that keeps us

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:35.840 align:middle line:90%
humble.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'd be
a good teacher.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Thank you very much.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
is psychic obesity?

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.625 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's what
we all go through.

00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It's when we get
started on the journey,

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and we go to the
bookstore or the library,

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.450 align:middle line:84%
if you were the kind of
person who went to the library

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:84%
in the day, or now you go to
YouTube or TikTok or something.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And you just start consuming
all this information.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever it is.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Whatever it is,
like going to the buffet,

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.502 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking a little bit
of everything trying to figure

00:38:05.502 --> 00:38:07.360 align:middle line:90%
out what it is you like.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And, at some point,
you have to-- you

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.770 align:middle line:84%
try everything it's
really good, but you

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:14.360 align:middle line:84%
have to start using some
discrimination in your diet

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.160 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And it really is a diet,
it's what we consume.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And we have to say, OK,
this is fun, I enjoy it,

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.600 align:middle line:84%
but maybe I need to
do it in smaller doses

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.480 align:middle line:84%
because this is good
for me, and this is what

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.250 align:middle line:90%
I need to spend some time on.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had
your ability to tap

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:36.680 align:middle line:84%
into one aspect of everything
we've talked about today,

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: Tapping completely
and have perfect knowledge of?

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: It would be--

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Handed to you.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: --handed to me.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:50.370 align:middle line:84%
It would be the complete
knowledge of the path of birth

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and rebirth experientially
on every step of the way.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: We hear so
much about reincarnation,

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.300 align:middle line:84%
but we often get
conflicting views.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: A lot of people are
very familiar with the Tibetan

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.580 align:middle line:84%
teachings from the Tibetan
Book of the Dead and various--

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Egyptian
Book of the Dead.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Right.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:08.448 align:middle line:90%
Exploitations have gone on.

00:39:08.448 --> 00:39:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the Egyptian
Book of the Dead.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.940 align:middle line:90%
We have all of these things.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.860 align:middle line:84%
It would be great to just
have that full understanding

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.920 align:middle line:84%
of the journey back and
forth experientially.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But I understand,
for someone who's

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:26.615 align:middle line:84%
had that, that's what
we call enlightenment.

00:39:26.615 --> 00:39:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it works.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.615 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: So what I'm
asking for is enlightenment.

00:39:29.615 --> 00:39:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It works.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.282 align:middle line:84%
Of your 20-some books,
which one is your favorite?

00:39:34.282 --> 00:39:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: That's
a tough question,

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.490 align:middle line:84%
but I think for
now my favorite is

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.110 align:middle line:84%
the one we talked
about I believe

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.990 align:middle line:84%
on the last show, Egregores,
the Occult Entities

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:47.920 align:middle line:84%
That Watch Over Human Destiny,
and I'll tell you why.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I had a great conversation
about this book

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:53.100 align:middle line:84%
with Joscelyn Godwin
before I wrote it.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just said
off the cuff, "You

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.930 align:middle line:84%
know I'm thinking about writing
this book," and he said, "Well,

00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:90%
that's a great idea."

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.000 align:middle line:90%
And I went home.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean I had some
notes set aside for it.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: But I just went
home, and I started writing it.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.550 align:middle line:90%
And it just flowed.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.740 align:middle line:84%
It was as if you and
I were sitting here

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.740 align:middle line:84%
talking about the topic, and
we recorded and transcribed it.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just like
we're doing now.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.682 align:middle line:90%
>>STAVISH: Just like now.

00:40:15.682 --> 00:40:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
it came so easily,

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.120 align:middle line:84%
it's been such a great
benefit to people.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.540 align:middle line:84%
It's been translated
into so many languages.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll say that's
my favorite one for now.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.748 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what would you
recommend to people, Mark,

00:40:27.748 --> 00:40:31.940 align:middle line:84%
who want to change their life
and they just don't know how?

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVISH: You have to
start somewhere and start

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.800 align:middle line:90%
with the small things.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Take responsibility
for the small things.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.370 align:middle line:84%
When people say they want
to change their lives,

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:47.860 align:middle line:84%
they want big things to
happen quickly and stay,

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.280 align:middle line:90%
and rarely does that happen.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.820 align:middle line:84%
It is very difficult
for people to understand

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and to accept that,
yes, believe it or not,

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.750 align:middle line:84%
making your bed first
thing in the morning

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.730 align:middle line:90%
