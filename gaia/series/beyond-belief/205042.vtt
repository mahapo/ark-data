00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.870 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:10%
One of our favorite guests
LA Marzulli with us.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Author, lecturer, filmmaker.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
He has penned 13
books, including

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:84%
the Nephilim trilogy
which has made

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.060 align:middle line:90%
the CBA series of bestsellers.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
His new film series on
the trail of the Nephilim

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:90%
already has five episodes.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And I say already because you're
constantly working on new ones.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.660 align:middle line:90%
You don't stop.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LA MARZULLI: Yeah, that's
true, and we love it.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:90%
I love what I do.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well--

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.378 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Absolutely.

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --first of all, I want
to tell folks about a tragedy

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:84%
that you encountered last
year during the California

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
wildfires that just completely
wiped out your house,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.518 align:middle line:84%
your library of videos,
almost everything you own.

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Absolutely
everything we owned.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:10%
It was incredibly traumatic.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:10%
My wife and I had PTSD
directly after that.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:10%
We didn't know--

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:10%
>>MARZULLI: --we had PTSD.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.432 align:middle line:10%
Walking around in a daze
for about six months.

00:01:16.432 --> 00:01:18.890 align:middle line:84%
We moved to Oklahoma and then
six months later, we kind of,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.137 align:middle line:90%
why did we move here anyway?

00:01:20.137 --> 00:01:21.845 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to move
back to California

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
rebuilding, but my library

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.710 align:middle line:84%
which had about, I don't know,
maybe 2000 books, a lot of them

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.620 align:middle line:84%
first edition things,
autographed, tomes.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And I had a special wall
with all the dog-eared notes,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.075 align:middle line:84%
Post-its, highlighted,
and all that's gone.

00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So I used to be able
to go and pull it.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I think it was on
page 56, and I would

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:84%
look because I had
my notes in the back,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and I could just pull it out and
go, oh yeah, it's on page 56.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:90%
And there it was.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.070 align:middle line:90%
All that's gone.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And at 70 years old, I can't
possibly reproduce that.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We take it for granted
of our living conditions--

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah, we do.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --until they're gone.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.507 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Until it's gone.

00:01:59.507 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then poof.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.905 align:middle line:90%
But you're rebuilding.

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And you're putting
your life together--

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: It's home.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:90%
It's home.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --again.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
The important thing, LA,
you and your wife are safe.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.388 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: We're safe.

00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
The animals, our daughter,
everybody got out.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We can
do another video.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.475 align:middle line:90%
We can't do another you.

00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Well, there we.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I'm
glad you're here.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.297 align:middle line:90%
Now tell us about your work.

00:02:17.297 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:84%
How'd you get involved
in the Nephilim,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and explain to people who
aren't biblically inclined,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:90%
just what are the Nephilim?

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: This goes
back to around circa 1988,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and I had always had trouble
with the biblical narrative.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
When you go to places
like Noah's flood,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:90%
and you kind of go, why?

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Why does this God
of the Old Testament

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:90%
destroy everybody on the planet?

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:84%
You kind of scratch
your head and go--

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.518 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why's he mean?

00:02:42.518 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to
Babel, the next thing,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.228 align:middle line:90%
and it's like, wait a minute.

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's confusing
the language.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Then you go to
Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.228 align:middle line:84%
it's fire and brimstone
on these guys, right?

00:02:52.228 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's everywhere.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.353 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah, it's
like, what's going on here?

00:02:55.353 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, when Joshua
and the crew, the Israelites,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:84%
come in to the
Promised Land, they're

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
killing everybody, burning
the cities, killing,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and you sit there and you go,
wait a minute, this Jesus,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
God of the Old Testament, how
do you reconcile these two?

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I was a brand new
Christian-- this is circa 1980.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So I've been vexed with this
for about eight, nine years.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And I remember getting
to the conquest of Canaan

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:90%
and just going, I can't do this.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:90%
And I don't understand this.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't get
anybody to explain it.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So one day, I was in a
bookstore and I was looking--

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.790 align:middle line:84%
someone had asked me about
life on other planets.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is the book
that changed my life.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Dr. IDE Thomas.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.020 align:middle line:84%
His book was called
"The Omega Conspiracy."

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.890 align:middle line:90%
I took it home.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:90%
I read it.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And he had the answers.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And he referenced books
from the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.230 align:middle line:90%
and the Ethiopian Bible--

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classics.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.947 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: --which are
not part of our canon.

00:03:54.947 --> 00:03:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Not part of our canon, OK?

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.240 align:middle line:90%
So I was blown away by this.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And specifically in the Book of
Enoch because what Enoch does

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:84%
is it gives us a view into the
antediluvian world that most

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:90%
people don't know about.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And Enoch was hidden,
really, from most people

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.630 align:middle line:84%
on the planet until RH
Charles discovered it

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:90%
in the 19th century.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.670 align:middle line:84%
What that does is it
gives us this view

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
of this incredible cosmic
battle which has been

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:90%
raging in an unseen dimension.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is
these fallen angels--

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
angels is just a
word for messenger--

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
these angelic entities make
an oath on Mount Hermon

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.270 align:middle line:90%
to do this deed.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
contaminate the seed,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and I'll get into that
because they take wives.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:84%
They have children
from the wives.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.668 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are
earthlings, earthling wives.

00:04:49.668 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: These are
earthly women but basically,

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:84%
an entity, inter-dimensional
entity, which is immortal.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So you get this
combination which

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
produces this hybrid entity
known as the Nephilim.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And this hails back to the
Genesis 3:15 narrative,

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:84%
which states, the
seed of the dragon

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
will be at enmity, at war,
with the seed of the woman.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.540 align:middle line:84%
He, coming from the
seed of the woman,

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:90%
will crush the dragon's head.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
That sets up the rest of
the biblical narrative.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
know what that means,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't have the
proper translation of it

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:90%
or understand it--

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.103 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't get it.

00:05:27.103 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: --then you never--
when you get to Noah's flood,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:84%
the Tower of Babel, Sodom
and Gomorrah, the five kings,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:84%
the whole deal, the
conquest of Canaan,

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.475 align:middle line:90%
you're left going like I was--

00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are the Nephilim evil?

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: They're
in a fixed state.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people call them
the soulless ones.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Enoch tells us that
they sinned against mankind.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:90%
They were cannibalistic.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:90%
They were sexually deviant.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were giants.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: They were giants.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.360 align:middle line:90%
They would come in and drink--

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:84%
they would tear off the
heads of people, allegedly,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:90%
and drink the blood.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like taking the
bottle cap off a beer.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: But Native
American, first nation people,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:90%
tell us exactly the same thing.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years later, these
red-haired, six-fingered giants

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
would come in, rip the heads off
to the Braves, drink the blood,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:90%
mutilate the bodies.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, crazy stuff.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is all in Native
American oral tradition.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making this stuff up.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.733 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
make this stuff up.

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: No, you can't.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In St. Louis,
where I come from a lot--

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.783 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Cahokia.

00:06:27.783 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --right across
the river in Cahokia,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Illinois, the Cahokia Mounds.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:90%
What the heck are these mounds?

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the planet.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.707 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: When
I was in Cahokia,

00:06:37.707 --> 00:06:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I just sat there and
stared at it for like, five

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:90%
minutes, before we did it.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:84%
My jaw on the ground
just going, OK.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:84%
What we did it in
the very first film

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:84%
is we deconstructed
to show people

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:90%
that this is an impossibility.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Something else is going on,
and what I mean by that--

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:84%
mainstream archaeologists
will tell us

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.545 align:middle line:84%
that Native Americans
built these mounds.

00:06:57.545 --> 00:06:59.840 align:middle line:84%
It took hundreds of years
and thousands of people

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:90%
one bucket of earth at a time.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.613 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:02.613 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:90%
They can believe what they--

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's possible.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: --want to believe.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:90%
It's possible, I guess.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But recent studies
on Cahokia showed

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:84%
it was built not in
300 years, and more

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
like maybe 20 years or
perhaps even less, based

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
on the pollen and the
tests that these guys did.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, we hired a flint
hoe which allegedly

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.420 align:middle line:84%
these Native
Americans were using.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:90%
We hired a flint knapper.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:84%
We created a museum replica
of a flint hoe that would

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:90%
be used at the time of Cahokia.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:90%
We hired a fit laborer.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:90%
We sent him out into the dirt--

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To duplicate this.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.065 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: --to
duplicate this--

00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:90%
near Cahokia.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Same soil.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:90%
And we filmed all this.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And we show him
digging into the dirt

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.528 align:middle line:84%
and then gathering
dirt in a bucket

00:07:45.528 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and then taking the bucket
and walking let's say,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:84%
200 yards to where the mound
would be emptying the dirt

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:90%
and then tapping it like this.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.023 align:middle line:90%
When I show that to people--

00:07:54.023 --> 00:07:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long that take?

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:55.458 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: --people just
die laughing in the audience.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:04.380 align:middle line:84%
But what it means is Cahokia
is about 450,000 tons of earth.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
If you were to
deconstruct the mound

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and put all that
dirt in dump trucks,

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.917 align:middle line:84%
you get end-to-end dump
trucks over 200 miles long.

00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:84%
That gives us an idea
of the amount of dirt.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Full to the top?

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Full to the top.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your film, "On
The Trail Of The Nephilim,"

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:84%
you take a look at what
the mounds look like.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:09:07.545 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.545 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
You can only see
that from above.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: It is.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.578 align:middle line:90%
Mind-blowing.

00:09:12.578 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
burial grounds, LA?

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: No, they're not.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.725 align:middle line:90%
They're not burial grounds.

00:09:16.725 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Although they have been used--

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans coming
in and will use them

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:84%
for secondary internments,
but the original--

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:84%
let's say, Cahokia because
you mentioned that.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:84%
On top of Cahokia,
was a platform.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And allegedly on
top of the platform,

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:84%
archaeologists believe
there was a construction

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:84%
about 50 feet by 100 feet
and allegedly 40 feet high.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:84%
There was a stockade all
around Cahokia 10 feet high.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Why do they need that?

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.240 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And in my opinion--

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Cahokia Miamisburg are the
sites that we've been to--

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.790 align:middle line:90%
these are gateways.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:90%
These are portals.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.960 align:middle line:90%
These are high places.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I could take
you to a place in England

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:90%
on the Salisbury Plain.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I could blindfold and
go, George, where are we?

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And you would look at that
mound and you go, wow,

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:90%
we're in Ohio, LA.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:05.010 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: But
we're not in Ohio.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.610 align:middle line:90%
We're in England.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They look the same.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah,
so they came over.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to them?

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, this
is what's amazing.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:84%
This debate went on
in the 19th century,

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.880 align:middle line:90%
and it was very heated.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And certain people are saying,
something else's going on here.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
There may be supernatural
things that we're looking at.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.840 align:middle line:84%
It might be the lost
tribes of Israel.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Something's going on,
but no one really knew.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
This guy, Cyrus
Thomas, around 1910,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:84%
1920, decreed Native
Americans built the mounds,

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:84%
but they simply forgot
that they had done so.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: And this is
taught in archaeological.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they believe it?

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: People believe it.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:84%
This is what you're taught,
and you regurgitate it

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:90%
if you're going to pass.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So people like me are looked
at as pseudo-archaeologists yet

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the field deconstructing
the popular narrative

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and saying, now wait a minute,
you got 10,000 mounds alone

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.040 align:middle line:90%
in Ohio.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:84%
That's all these people
did all day long?

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.995 align:middle line:84%
And Native Americans coming
into Ohio like the Shawnee now--

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:05.370 align:middle line:84%
archaeologists
saying the Shawnee

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle line:90%
built the Serpent Mound in Ohio.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest snake
effigy on the planet.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So the Shawnee
chief, which we show

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:84%
in the film, states
on the record,

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:84%
the Shawnee did not
build the Serpent Mound.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:90%
So who do we believe?

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now we've got a clip,
LA, from one of your series,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.300 align:middle line:84%
of course, about the official
explanation for the mounds,

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.082 align:middle line:90%
and let's look at this theory.

00:11:26.082 --> 00:11:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR (ON
VIDEO): Cyrus Thomas

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.290 align:middle line:84%
is credited as creating the
paradigm which still exists

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:84%
today that Native
Americans built the mounds,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
but they had forgotten
they had done so.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.780 align:middle line:84%
However, are there
artifacts that might

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:90%
point to a different narrative?

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:10%
Throughout the 18th
and 19th centuries,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.940 align:middle line:10%
reports of giant skeletons
were printed in newspapers

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:10%
all across the country as
people dug into the mounds

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:10%
and unearthed the bones of
what seemed like a lost race.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.860 align:middle line:10%
Why has this been left out
of the official narrative?

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:10%
Why are other artifacts like axe
heads weighing over 30 pounds

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:10%
called ceremonial?

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
What if they're not
ceremonial but utilitarian?

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.340 align:middle line:10%
Why is it that
Native Americans talk

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.280 align:middle line:10%
about a race of giants
that inhabited the land

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:10%
before they did?

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.390 align:middle line:84%
They tell of six-fingered,
red-haired giants

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
who were often cannibalistic
as well as sexually perverse.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Is there a hidden
history that has

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.510 align:middle line:90%
been deliberately obfuscated?

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you just
pointed out to us.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I would have hated to have
lived during that era.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.732 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:12:32.732 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Terrifying.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Terrifying, indeed.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI:
Absolutely terrifying.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.223 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did
they find the bones

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:39.260 align:middle line:90%
of these so-called giants?

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: They were
everywhere basically

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.490 align:middle line:84%
from the Eastern United
States all across-- from coast

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:84%
to coast, no pun intended,
but they're everywhere.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we had a
lead on something

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.140 align:middle line:84%
today, which we're
trying to vet,

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.342 align:middle line:84%
allegedly of a 9-footer in situ
in an undisclosed location.

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Whether that's true
or not, I don't know,

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:90%
but that came in this morning.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this information,
LA, being suppressed?

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Absolutely.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: When I
was out in Catalina,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I got wind that a
cache of records

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:84%
had been discovered
by Ralph Glidden.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Glidden was a
primitive archaeologist

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.695 align:middle line:84%
employed played by the
Heye museum in 1919-1921.

00:13:15.695 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:84%
He was out there in
the Channel Islands

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.902 align:middle line:84%
which go from Santa
Barbara down to San Diego.

00:13:19.902 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing these
primitive archaeological digs.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
He was digging up 9-footers
and even talked about this.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.910 align:middle line:90%
All that was suppressed.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, this cache of
records just basically left

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
the planet for 50 years,
and John Boraggina

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
discovered it in
the Wrigley Theater

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:90%
on the island of Catalina.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
It was front-page
news in the LA Times.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I got wind of it.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It took me six months
to get the museum

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:84%
to allow me to
come on the island

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and look at the documents,
pictures, whatever they had.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
reluctant, indeed.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.442 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Very much so.

00:13:51.442 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I sent them
$1,000 check--

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that--

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: --for
the new museum.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --changes their mind.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: And that
opened the door.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.530 align:middle line:84%
That opened the door,
and I was there.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.233 align:middle line:84%
And I did spend some
time in the archives.

00:14:01.233 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not a lot depending
what I'm doing.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.525 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time,
it's out in the field

00:14:04.525 --> 00:14:06.215 align:middle line:84%
talking to people
actually on site.

00:14:06.215 --> 00:14:08.090 align:middle line:84%
But archives are incredible
because you never

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:90%
know what you're going to get.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm there in the archives
in the museum on Catalina

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and John Boraggina brings out
museum boxes, and in the museum

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:84%
boxes are Manila folders
with pictures in them,

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:84%
because I asked
to see that first.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Within 20 minutes, I had the
picture which went viral.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It's Ralph Glidden leaning on
a shovel in an excavated grave,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and in front of him,
is a skeleton in situ.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was big,
but I didn't know how big,

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
so I sent the picture to
three different guys, techies,

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.210 align:middle line:84%
who looked at this thing,
deconstructed it, digitized it,

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
knew the height of Ralph
Glidden at 5'8", and basically,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.930 align:middle line:84%
all three of them, no collusion
until after they gave me

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.370 align:middle line:84%
the data, that we did a
conference call together,

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:84%
which was a real hoot, they all
put it just around 9 feet tall.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A giant.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: A giant.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A giant.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: A giant.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can't
talk about mounds

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.087 align:middle line:84%
without talking
about Serpent Mound.

00:14:57.087 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:10%
>> NARRATOR (ON VIDEO): The
Serpent Mound is the largest

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:10%
snake effigy in the world.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It sits on an outcropping of
land that overlooks a waterway.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
The serpent undulates
through the landscape,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and this corresponds
to solar alignments.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Some say that the head points
to the summer solstice.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:84%
A two-story tower's
erected on the site

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:84%
so visitors can see
the serpent's body.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.010 align:middle line:84%
However, even from
this vantage point,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:84%
it's still difficult to see
the head of the serpent.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:84%
It is only when one is
high above the effigy does

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.140 align:middle line:84%
one begin to see
the serpent's head

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:84%
whose mouth is wide open in
the act of swallowing an egg.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Why go through the trouble
of constructing this

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:84%
if the person viewing
it can't really

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
see what they are
looking at unless they

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.280 align:middle line:84%
are high in the air
above the effigy?

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Who is the prince of
the power of the air?

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It reminds me of
the Nazca Lines in Peru.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: It's similar.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.767 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same kind of thing.

00:15:51.767 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Very, very similar.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.047 align:middle line:84%
You can only really
appreciate it--

00:15:55.047 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I've been there three
different times.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a tower that goes
up about two stories.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can you get an idea
of what you're looking at,

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.100 align:middle line:84%
but when I flew a drone up
a couple of hundred feet,

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and actually higher than
that, all of a sudden

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:84%
the whole effigy
comes into view.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.565 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand that
this serpent is based on an 18

00:16:13.565 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 year lunar cycle.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Serpent's head is
agape showing it

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:84%
in the act of attempting
to swallow an egg, OK?

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:84%
This goes right back to
the Genesis 3:15 narrative

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:84%
which states, "The
seed of a dragon

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.620 align:middle line:84%
will be at war with
the seed of a woman."

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.130 align:middle line:84%
The serpent, there it is,
trying to devour that egg.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:90%
And only see it from the air.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's thousands of years old.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.503 align:middle line:84%
Why construct
something like this--

00:16:39.503 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That you can't see?

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: --that
you can't see.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unless it's
for something above.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: So who is the
prince of the power of the air?

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: The dragon.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You made something
called "Mathematical Mysteries

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.490 align:middle line:90%
of the Mound Builders."

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, we knew that
there was advanced geometry,

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:84%
advanced surveying
techniques, trigonometry,

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't know
to what depth, OK?

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:84%
We brought in mathematicians,
multidisciplinary,

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:90%
to try to get an idea.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:90%
I hired a surveyor to go--

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you the first one.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:84%
The Newark Circle Mound,
the Great Circle Mound,

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.720 align:middle line:90%
is about 1,200 feet across.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:90%
There's a moat--

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's pretty
good size, right?

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.128 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Really good size.

00:17:17.128 --> 00:17:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was my first
mound encounter.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:84%
If I can talk about this for a
second, someone told me about--

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Russ Dizdar told me about it.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:90%
So I'm there at a conference.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.973 align:middle line:84%
I asked my driver, can you take
me to the Great Circle Mound?

00:17:30.973 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:84%
He says, yes, so he drops
me off at the parking lot.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I walk up this little,
narrow asphalt path,

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and I get to the
top and I turn--

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'm feeling
the chills here--

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and I look at this thing, this
huge circle with the entrance.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.460 align:middle line:90%
And I just froze in my tracks.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:10%
And I just sat there just like
vibrating, looking at this,

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.380 align:middle line:10%
realizing that this has
deep meaning for me,

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:10%
this is my future although I
didn't know it at the time,

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:10%
but I'm looking at
the fingerprints

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:10%
of the supernatural.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So we hired a surveyor
to go in and measure

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.883 align:middle line:84%
the moat because there's
no waterway around there.

00:18:09.883 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this the
Great Circle Mound?

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: This is
the Great Circle Mound.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a moat all the
way in the interior.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.478 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
that's unusual.

00:18:15.478 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: So
basically, he told us

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:84%
for all practical
purposes, it's dead level.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It's within 6 inches to a
foot of being dead level.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, let's look at this
because this is fascinating.

00:18:26.585 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NARRATOR (ON VIDEO): The
Great Circle Mound in Newark,

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Ohio, is over 1,200
feet in diameter.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:84%
It has an interior
moat on the inside

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
of which in ancient times,
was filled with water.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.980 align:middle line:84%
How did the ancients
create a level surface

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
so that the water would
fill the moat equally?

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Todd Willis is a surveyor and
also a structural engineer.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:84%
We hired Todd to survey the
moat to see how level it was.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
We were astounded to
discover that the moat,

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:84%
for all practical
purposes, was dead level.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:84%
How was this done
thousands of years

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
ago before the invention of
surveying equipment like what

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Squier and Davis used?

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
How were the builders
able to construct the moat

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:90%
without the use of a transit?

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Does this moat inside
the Great Circle Mound

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:84%
present a problem in that
without some kind of surveying

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.410 align:middle line:84%
equipment, it would be
almost impossible to keep

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:27.190 align:middle line:84%
the bottom of the moat
level for hundreds of feet?

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Are we looking at
the fingerprints

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.220 align:middle line:84%
of the supernatural
hiding in plain sight?

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aren't moats
built to keep things out?

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
the purpose here?

00:19:38.435 --> 00:19:40.690 align:middle line:10%
>>MARZULLI: This is ceremonial.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:10%
Allegedly, at the entrance
of the Great Circle Mound,

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:50.230 align:middle line:10%
there were two dragon heads
that were deconstructed.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.932 align:middle line:84%
It was used as a
fairground, so there's

00:19:51.932 --> 00:19:53.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot of sluff in the
bottom of that mound that

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:84%
can account easily
for 6 inches to a foot

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:84%
over a couple of thousand years
of just things falling into it.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Deconstruct it take away all
the trees, fill the moat up--

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and I believe if
archaeologists with Lidar,

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:90%
they could probably do this.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:10%
There's a canal, some
sort of a stone canal

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:10%
that, like Curse of Oak
Island, brings water

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.032 align:middle line:10%
to the moat that's
hidden away, that they

00:20:19.032 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:10%
don't know where it is.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why is it dry now?

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.735 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, because
whatever that feed--

00:20:23.735 --> 00:20:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Source was--

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: --of water,
source, is not there anymore.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But to construct something like
that-- just think about it.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.160 align:middle line:84%
If we were going to just do
that in the ancient world,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.160 align:middle line:90%
there's no wheelbarrows.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:90%
There's no backhoes.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.380 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a shovel.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.890 align:middle line:84%
You've got these little
goofy shoulder blades of deer

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
that you're using as a
pick, or perhaps flint,

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and you got to haul
water in deerskin--

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you do that?

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: It's preposterous.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With little buckets.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, yeah, with
deerskin buckets or whatever.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much of earth was
used to construct these mounds?

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, again,
Cahokia is the largest

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:84%
mound in the United States, and
that is well over 450,000 tons.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And again, for an ancient, if
you were to deconstruct that,

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.420 align:middle line:84%
that's a very large mound
complex, 3 and 1/2 miles

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:90%
of continuous earthen walls.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
You deconstruct that, that's
over 200 miles of dump trucks

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:90%
end-to-end.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And so Cahokia is probably
300 miles of dump trucks

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.740 align:middle line:90%
end-to-end.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: LA, what exactly,
first of all, is Octagon Mound?

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: The Octagon
Mound is an unequal octagon.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, a normal
octagon has eight equal sides.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.820 align:middle line:84%
This octagon in Ohio, has
two sides which are unequal,

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
so whoever is doing this,
mathematically, it's

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.810 align:middle line:90%
absolutely incredible.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing for us to draw
with a compass and a square

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and a ruler, a small
octagon on a piece of paper,

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.808 align:middle line:84%
but even then, you've got to
know geometry just to draw--

00:21:47.808 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you have to.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.433 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: You have
to know geometry.

00:21:50.433 --> 00:21:52.533 align:middle line:84%
So we go back a couple
of thousand years.

00:21:52.533 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some of us
believe that the Octagon's

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:middle line:90%
about 4,000 years old.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.770 align:middle line:90%
We put a very old date on it.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's one thing to
draw eight equal sides.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:10%
It's another thing to have
two of those sides unequal.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And then this thing is
running hundreds of feet.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.490 align:middle line:90%
How do you check your work?

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:14.070 align:middle line:84%
How do you check your work when
the octagon comprises 50 acres.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:90%
I've been in it.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: I've
played golf there.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.012 align:middle line:90%
I've been in there twice.

00:22:17.012 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you're on one
side, and you look over

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.635 align:middle line:84%
there, you kind of go, I
have no idea what this is.

00:22:21.635 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
they say a picture

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:90%
is worth a thousand words.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NARRATOR (ON VIDEO): The
Octagon Mound was a part

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.660 align:middle line:84%
of the Newark Earthworks which
included the Great Circle Mound

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
with the moat that
Todd Willis surveyed.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The entire amount of dirt
that was moved and compacted

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:84%
to create these structures
exceeds 500,000 tons of earth.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
There is advanced mathematics
that was used to construct this

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:84%
complex which was built on
a 18.5-year lunar cycle.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:84%
When standing in
the Octagon, one

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.750 align:middle line:84%
has no idea of what
shape it actually

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:84%
is as it is large
enough to house

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.030 align:middle line:90%
the Great Pyramid of Egypt.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Where did this
advanced mathematic

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:84%
used throughout this
complex originate from?

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that this earthwork
like The Serpent Mound

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:90%
can only be seen from the air?

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that this advanced
mathematical knowledge

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
seemed to disappear and was
not acknowledged or remembered

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.260 align:middle line:84%
by every known Native
American tribe?

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this
tell you about our past?

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Well, it's hidden.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.430 align:middle line:90%
There is a hidden history.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's hidden
in plain sight.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And the powers that be,
for whatever reason,

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.120 align:middle line:84%
have deliberately
obfuscated much of it.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And myself-- I mean, look
at Graham Hancock's work,

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.540 align:middle line:90%
look at Mr. Childress' work.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, others are in the
field doing the same thing.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I have a slightly
different perspective

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
because I think these
are the fingerprints

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.350 align:middle line:90%
of the supernatural.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:58.940 align:middle line:90%
I think we're looking at--

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
the dragon is definitely
into this thing

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
just like the Book
of Enoch tells us.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.685 align:middle line:84%
And these are
constructs, and we'll

00:24:06.685 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
get into this a
little bit later,

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:84%
they were linked together
in profound ways.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way
it's coincidental.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.870 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that you can
only see it from above

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:90%
tells you what?

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, that
whoever was doing this

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.780 align:middle line:84%
has the power to fly around and
that gets-- see, in my opinion,

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm always looking
for a unified theory.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So how do I connect the
modern day UFO event,

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.260 align:middle line:90%
which are now real by the way--

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.870 align:middle line:84%
we've known they were
real, but now, we're

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
told they're real by the
Pentagon and everybody else.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:84%
But how do I connect
that with what

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:84%
happened with the
Great Pyramid of Egypt

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:84%
with the Circle Mound, the
Octagon Mound, Cahokia,

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.240 align:middle line:90%
and other places?

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And my unified theory goes
back to the Book of Enoch which

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.972 align:middle line:90%
tells us that these entities--

00:24:55.972 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:84%
some people would call
them the Anunnaki.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.055 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
would call them.

00:24:59.055 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And the similarities
between them

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:84%
are very, very similar,
extremely similar,

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:84%
so are we looking at the
same entities coming here?

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.500 align:middle line:84%
The mythos is
slightly different,

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.580 align:middle line:84%
but the end game is
kind of the same thing.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they built
for the ETs or with the ETs?

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.372 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Both.

00:25:20.372 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
Nephilim come in,

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and I call it fallen
angel technology Nephilim

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.053 align:middle line:90%
architecture.

00:25:26.053 --> 00:25:27.470 align:middle line:84%
When you go to
these places like--

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.458 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, when you
go to places like Cahokia,

00:25:30.458 --> 00:25:34.185 align:middle line:84%
and you realize the absurdity
of 500,000 tons of earth

00:25:34.185 --> 00:25:35.810 align:middle line:84%
by a group of people
doing this thing--

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:90%
and then it's compacted.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Some of these mounds
are compacted.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.860 align:middle line:84%
The dirt is compacted so tight
that when you tunnel into them,

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:90%
you don't need supports.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:90%
The earth just holds itself.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.460 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like it's cemented.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.780 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to get permission
to do soil testing on some

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.455 align:middle line:84%
And so far, we haven't
been able to get that.

00:25:55.455 --> 00:25:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You needed
to know archaeology

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:90%
in order to do that.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: You needed to
know geometry, trigonometry,

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.380 align:middle line:90%
surveying techniques.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And Native Americans
didn't have those.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Europeans didn't have
trigonometry when this thing

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:90%
was built 4,000 years ago.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.440 align:middle line:90%
It didn't exist.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
locations, LA, supernatural?

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.982 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do things happen
there out of the norm?

00:26:18.982 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Absolutely.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And the third film
of the series,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.970 align:middle line:84%
"Secrets of the Supernatural
- Voices from The Other Side,"

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Russ Dizdar states
on film that if these

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:84%
are Nephilim sites,
then we should

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.770 align:middle line:90%
see some sort of activity.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:84%
When we were there, we saw
stuff that just blew us away.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a testimony
from one guy in particular,

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:47.120 align:middle line:84%
a pastor who when he
moved into the area had

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:84%
no idea what he was up against,
he saw tables levitate.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.900 align:middle line:84%
There was this room that
you'd open the door,

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:90%
it was a crawl space.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Then you'd open the door
again a couple of days later,

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.740 align:middle line:90%
it was a black hole.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.453 align:middle line:90%
It just went down, down, down--

00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like endless?

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And they would
throw things down,

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and they would never
hit the bottom.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all sorts of
strange phenomenon.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Henry Gruver went
to the Serpent Mound

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and basically, he was
called to do this.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And so he would go
and try to break some

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.198 align:middle line:90%
of the stuff that was there.

00:27:17.198 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
When we were there,
there was a coven

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.660 align:middle line:90%
of wiccans who were there.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.735 align:middle line:90%
Gee, I wonder why?

00:27:21.735 --> 00:27:24.110 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly what's going
on with the Serpent Mound.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So Gruver's there,
and he's alone.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:90%
And there's a light snowfall.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And he does this thing on
top of the Serpent's Head,

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
breaks every type
of power that there.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.300 align:middle line:84%
As he comes walking back,
he gets sucker-punched.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.270 align:middle line:90%
There's no one there.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:90%
He's on the ground.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.870 align:middle line:90%
He can't move.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:41.020 align:middle line:90%
He's basically paralyzed.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:90%
And he cries out.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:44.140 align:middle line:90%
He goes, why is this happening?

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:90%
And the ward speaks to him.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.897 align:middle line:84%
It says, well, you weren't
called to come here.

00:27:47.897 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And he learned a
very important lesson

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.272 align:middle line:84%
that you just don't go
into sites like this

00:27:51.272 --> 00:27:53.150 align:middle line:90%
unless you're called to do so.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:54.160 align:middle line:90%
So he was freed up.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.580 align:middle line:90%
I think for me, one of the--

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.200 align:middle line:84%
we were on this place
called Geller Hill.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Allegedly, it's a burial site.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest
point in Newark, Ohio.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Octagon Mound, Great
Circle Mound, Geller Hill

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.920 align:middle line:84%
creates a triangle,
perfect isosceles triangle.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.883 align:middle line:90%
That's deliberate.

00:28:12.883 --> 00:28:14.050 align:middle line:90%
We're on top of Geller Hill.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:16.133 align:middle line:84%
We're going to film there
at this ancient Nephilim

00:28:16.133 --> 00:28:16.933 align:middle line:90%
graveyard.

00:28:16.933 --> 00:28:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you can't dig.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:84%
But they took out a lot
of large skeletons here,

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.950 align:middle line:90%
allegedly, 100 years ago.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:90%
So we're there.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.730 align:middle line:90%
It starts to rain.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.220 align:middle line:84%
The Newark Paranormal group
is tagging along with us.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:84%
They've contacted Fritz
Zimmerman, and Fritz said, LA,

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:30.490 align:middle line:90%
can they?

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.170 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.040 align:middle line:90%
More the merrier.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So we duck into this
very well groomed forest.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.230 align:middle line:84%
At this point, this woman
takes out this little device.

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:90%
And I have no idea what it is.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.720 align:middle line:84%
She turns it on, and we hear
a voice, and it says, evil.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of go,
whoa, what's that?

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.380 align:middle line:84%
She goes, oh, this
is an obelisk.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's an obelisk?

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:55.240 align:middle line:84%
It's got 5,000 words, and
what it does, allegedly,

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.700 align:middle line:84%
if there are any entities
or spirits in the area--

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.033 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It speaks itself.

00:28:59.033 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: It's like a
high-tech Ouija board.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.408 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
that at the time.

00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So we walked down
50 yards, whatever,

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and the thing spews out
another words, witch.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.110 align:middle line:90%
So we get "evil" and "witch."

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
I go, wait a minute.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.950 align:middle line:90%
This is high-tech necromancy.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:16.660 align:middle line:90%
This is a high-tech Ouija board.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.750 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this stuff.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:18.550 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.560 align:middle line:84%
This is all on camera,
and it's in the film.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.815 align:middle line:84%
And I say, look--
and I'm with people

00:29:22.815 --> 00:29:24.940 align:middle line:84%
that don't believe like I
believe, and that's fine.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.740 align:middle line:90%
We can all get along, right?

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.866 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're at Gaia.

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:28.783 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:29:28.783 --> 00:29:29.510 align:middle line:90%
It's supposed to be.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Thank you, guys.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Gaia.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.320 align:middle line:90%
But I go, I'm going to pray.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it now.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it's on film, and I
just shut the thing down.

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:37.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, Father, just
shut this thing down.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:38.830 align:middle line:90%
This isn't from you.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Shut it down.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So the woman that's with
me, Gaylen, she goes,

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:90%
what should I do?

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.005 align:middle line:90%
I go, turn off the machine.

00:29:45.005 --> 00:29:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Turns off the machine.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:48.040 align:middle line:90%
We wait about 30 seconds.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.690 align:middle line:90%
I go, OK, turn it back on.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:84%
She turns it back on,
and she's looking at it

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.130 align:middle line:90%
waiting for the word to pop up.

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And we show this in the
film, and the word, "holy--"

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.513 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're at total change.

00:29:59.513 --> 00:30:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: --pops up.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And her face does everything.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Her mouth drops open.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.650 align:middle line:90%
She looks at it.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:09.250 align:middle line:84%
It looks at me, and later, we
bring the Newark Paranormal

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:90%
group on camera.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:14.750 align:middle line:84%
They had never seen anything
like this in all of their quest

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.550 align:middle line:90%
looking for ghosts.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is
Audrey Vanderkley?

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Audrey
Vanderkley is a woman

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.580 align:middle line:84%
that was with us at
the Circle Mound.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Chief Joseph Riverwind was
at the Great Circle Mound,

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:90%
and we were there.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.653 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here's her story.

00:30:30.653 --> 00:30:32.570 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDREY VANDERKLEY: So
we were at the Mounds,

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:10%
and Chief Joseph
had called us up

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:10%
on to the mounds
to do some praying

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:10%
and some spiritual warfare.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And he had asked someone to
come up and read some scripture,

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.140 align:middle line:84%
so as the lady was
reading scripture,

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.160 align:middle line:90%
I had my back towards her.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I heard a commotion,
and I turned around.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this lady on
the ground and people

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.330 align:middle line:90%
were picking her up.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure what
happened at that time

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.330 align:middle line:90%
so we just continued praying.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.770 align:middle line:84%
When it was over, and we
came down off the mound,

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:06.530 align:middle line:84%
I turned around, and I looked
at her and another lady

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:90%
she was with.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing
some spiritual warfare,

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.350 align:middle line:84%
just praying, just
kind of rebuking.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't sure
what was going on.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I just felt that
I had to do that.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that, I felt
something come at me,

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.400 align:middle line:84%
come on me, and
scratch me from the top

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.940 align:middle line:84%
of my head down to my neck,
so down my front of my face.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was all tingly
and stuff like that.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.230 align:middle line:90%
I became disorientated.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I had some brain fog
for 20 to 30 minutes.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:90%
It was just really strange.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was
because of the mounds or what,

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.930 align:middle line:84%
but something
definitely was there.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.950 align:middle line:84%
After the event and I
had been home for a month

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.980 align:middle line:84%
to two months
later, I still felt

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.770 align:middle line:84%
that tingling where I
felt I was scratched.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:32:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And I did ask for prayer, and
I was praying with others just

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.983 align:middle line:84%
to make sure nothing
had attached to me.

00:32:03.983 --> 00:32:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
obvious, LA, there's

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.633 align:middle line:84%
something mystical
going on here.

00:32:07.633 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: There's
absolutely no doubt.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.020 align:middle line:84%
So again, our premise is
these are Nephilim sites--

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Nephilim architecture,
fallen angel technology.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And if it is that, then
they're highly charged,

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and that charge is
still there, which

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.130 align:middle line:84%
is why all this stuff is
happening on all these areas.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.922 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All these
years, it's still there.

00:32:24.922 --> 00:32:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Same thing.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.082 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the Bible
accurate with the Nephilim?

00:32:29.082 --> 00:32:31.123 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: I think it's
very accurate with that.

00:32:31.123 --> 00:32:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.010 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.552 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Is this
a trick question?

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, not
at all, but I just

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:90%
want to know where they went.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.410 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: In our Watchers
10, with the late Richard Shaw,

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:51.830 align:middle line:84%
we picked up on Steve
Quayle's story with the giant.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:52.847 align:middle line:90%
And he was on your show.

00:32:52.847 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:90%
You came on Watchers, so--

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.917 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: --thank
you for that--

00:32:55.917 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:84%
talking about the giant
that Steve Quayle had.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.210 align:middle line:84%
But we had another man who
allegedly was a shooter.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed this
guy two or three times

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.745 align:middle line:84%
before just on the phone
checking out his story,

00:33:06.745 --> 00:33:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and then we finally
brought him--

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He seemed
legitimate, didn't he?

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah,
very legitimate.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why every
time he got to the point

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:17.090 align:middle line:84%
where one of his battle buddies
was picked up and impaled

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.210 align:middle line:84%
by the spear of this giant,
he would break down and cry,

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.690 align:middle line:90%
so I knew something was up.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And he told us a story
about the giant of Kandahar,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'll get into
the aftermath of what

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.810 align:middle line:84%
happened after that story,
but that went viral.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.640 align:middle line:90%
That thing was at least 12 feet.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.370 align:middle line:84%
He was dispatched
along with a patrol

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.230 align:middle line:84%
to find another patrol
which had gone missing.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So they never met their checking
points, their rally points.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And they choppered down
and followed the tracks.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And they come around this
goat trail leading down,

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and they see what looks like
wreckage of radios and body

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:53.600 align:middle line:84%
parts and things like this,
so their weapons are ready.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.070 align:middle line:90%
So above them is a cave.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Out of this cave, comes a
nightmare, at least 12 feet.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:90%
And 12 feet is really tall.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Alive.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: It's
alive and screaming.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.160 align:middle line:90%
With a spear.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.389 align:middle line:84%
And this thing runs at a speed
which just blows them away.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:90%
How fast this thing moves.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Before they can do anything,
it has impaled one of the guys

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.000 align:middle line:90%
and holds him up like this.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And just
holding him up.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: And they kill the
thing, and a chopper comes in.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Had six fingers, red hair,
double rows of teeth,

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.739 align:middle line:90%
and stunk to high heaven.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.380 align:middle line:84%
They all had to sign
nondisclosure agreements.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.449 align:middle line:90%
And the giant of Kandahar--

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to people who
were stationed in Kandahar

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:36.070 align:middle line:84%
at that same base years later,
and they knew about the rumor,

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.820 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't allowed
to talk about it.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.210 align:middle line:90%
They've come up to me--

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and then we vetted his story
with another soldier who

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.610 align:middle line:90%
was there shortly afterwards.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:46.570 align:middle line:84%
When we did this, and
we produced a film.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And I went out on your show
talked about it on Coast

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.060 align:middle line:90%
to Coast, the whole deal.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great response.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: I was at a
conference in Dallas,

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.659 align:middle line:84%
to hear the Watchmen
conference in Dallas,

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and I was approached by a
guy from the Deep State who

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.330 align:middle line:84%
basically threatened
me three different ways

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:05.630 align:middle line:90%
in the first five minutes.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:09.110 align:middle line:84%
My cell phone would have
child pornography on it,

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.910 align:middle line:90%
my car would have--

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, the
brakes would fail,

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.860 align:middle line:90%
and I go over the cliff.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.290 align:middle line:90%
One of my kids would go missing.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He actually
threatened--

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Actually
said those things.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --you like this?

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: I have
a witness to it.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't go alone,
I have a witness to it.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.848 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think he
some whack job or what?

00:35:21.848 --> 00:35:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: No, this
guy was the real deal.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.340 align:middle line:84%
He showed me the
badge, the whole deal.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, I'm
here because of what you

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:31.160 align:middle line:90%
did with the giant of Kandahar.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't want you doing that.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it
they want so secretive?

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Because it shows
the veracity of a supernatural.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:90%
It goes back to the Nephilim.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.320 align:middle line:90%
So this thing was there.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It proves things.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: And we don't
know how old that thing was.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Could have been 2,000
years old, exactly?

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Exactly.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it's part-human,
but it's also part-angelic

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.647 align:middle line:84%
which is immortal,
so this thing could

00:35:57.647 --> 00:35:58.730 align:middle line:90%
be 2,000, 3,000 years old.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
could be more of them.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:00.733 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Exactly.

00:36:00.733 --> 00:36:01.820 align:middle line:90%
I think there are.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.028 align:middle line:90%
Well, there are more of them.

00:36:03.028 --> 00:36:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have investigated
America's Stonehenge,

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and you've done a
great job doing that.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Thank you.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.128 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI (ON VIDEO):
There is an ancient site

00:36:10.128 --> 00:36:12.620 align:middle line:84%
in New Hampshire that may
date back 4,000 years.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.350 align:middle line:84%
It is called
America's Stonehenge.

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:18.260 align:middle line:84%
There are precise alignments
of standing stones

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:84%
which reflect the
solstices and equinoxes.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.290 align:middle line:84%
There is also a
controversial stone altar

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.380 align:middle line:84%
which may have been used
for human sacrifice.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:30.890 align:middle line:84%
The site is built on an 18
and 1/2 year lunar cycle

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.770 align:middle line:84%
like that of Stonehenge,
England, and the Great Circle

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Mound and Octagon Mound
complex that we see in Ohio.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And America Stonehenge's
massive stones

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:43.100 align:middle line:84%
were fitted together to
create this mysterious site.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.150 align:middle line:84%
But whoever built it
seemingly abandoned them.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:49.460 align:middle line:84%
You will see just how
incredible this site

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.220 align:middle line:84%
is as we reveal
what appears to be

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:56.420 align:middle line:84%
a deliberate and orchestrated
relationship to Stonehenge,

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.510 align:middle line:84%
England, as well as
other megalithic sites

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:01.100 align:middle line:90%
around the globe.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's just an
amazing discovery, again.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.050 align:middle line:90%
This is everywhere, isn't it?

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: It's
hidden in plain sight.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:08.940 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely--

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right under our noses.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: --right
under our noses.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.982 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do most
people understand this?

00:37:13.982 --> 00:37:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: No, and that's
why we're making the film.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:19.310 align:middle line:10%
I mean, to me what it does
is it shows that there

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:21.290 align:middle line:10%
is a hidden history,
that something

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:24.260 align:middle line:10%
went on in the far distant
past, that's been deliberately

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.040 align:middle line:10%
obfuscated from us.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the deeper
I go with all this,

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:34.280 align:middle line:84%
the more astounded I
am just at the network,

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.670 align:middle line:84%
at the way this thing was
global, how it was set up,

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and it goes back to
our mission statement

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.960 align:middle line:84%
to expose the deception of the
prince of the power of the air

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and to herald the
return of the King.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
do in the films.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.660 align:middle line:84%
We're showing that
something is going on here.

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:90%
It's very deliberate.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.690 align:middle line:90%
It's managed.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:52.980 align:middle line:90%
It's orchestrated.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And then for whatever reason,
the people who built that site,

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.420 align:middle line:90%
they just disappear.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is LA the
18.6-year lunar year?

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.710 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: This is
something-- and in the film,

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.210 align:middle line:84%
the second installment,
we take you

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.980 align:middle line:84%
to different places
with different experts

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.090 align:middle line:84%
where I say, where
did this come from?

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.270 align:middle line:84%
We know from the Book
of Enoch that there

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:15.120 align:middle line:84%
was a fallen angel
by the name of Sariel

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.990 align:middle line:90%
who just handed this to mankind.

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sariel.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:17.840 align:middle line:90%


00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Sariel.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.880 align:middle line:84%
That just gave this
knowledge to mankind.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.110 align:middle line:90%
But here's the deal.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And you go you, and
you talk to people

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:25.965 align:middle line:84%
who've study the megaliths
all over the world.

00:38:25.965 --> 00:38:27.840 align:middle line:84%
They're built on 18 and
1/2 year lunar cycle.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is what you
have to do in antiquity.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.662 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back 4,000 years ago.

00:38:32.662 --> 00:38:34.120 align:middle line:84%
We know the moon's
doing something,

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.120 align:middle line:90%
but we're not sure what.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.690 align:middle line:90%
It goes up, and it goes down.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to do that
a couple of times a month

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.200 align:middle line:90%
and then it changes.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
track the moon.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So we get some sticks out,
we line some things up,

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:90%
we make some notches.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.900 align:middle line:90%
We get some deer hide.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.980 align:middle line:90%
We try to crunch the data.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, then all of a
sudden, a storm moves in,

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:53.430 align:middle line:90%
and we lose five days.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.920 align:middle line:90%
How would you even know?

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.580 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to track the
moon for 18 and 1/2 years

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.600 align:middle line:84%
before you would know that it's
an 18 and 1/2 year lunar cycle.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And you would have
to crunch the data.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.385 align:middle line:90%
How would you crunch the data?

00:39:08.385 --> 00:39:09.633 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And with what?

00:39:09.633 --> 00:39:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: It's astounding.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:90%
It's mind-blowing.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.520 align:middle line:10%
Only in modernity,
we can do it now.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.920 align:middle line:84%
But you go back 4,000 years ago,
and this is just, oh, they just

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:90%
did it.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.520 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.150 align:middle line:90%
It came from up there.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:90%
It was given.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:24.867 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you were
at American Stonehenge,

00:39:24.867 --> 00:39:29.502 align:middle line:84%
you investigated a stone that
had some kind of writing on it.

00:39:29.502 --> 00:39:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: The stone is
called the Baal Stone.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.392 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, let's look.

00:39:33.392 --> 00:39:34.060 align:middle line:10%
>>EXPERT (ON VIDEO):
Yeah, this stone

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.500 align:middle line:10%
was found in the
chamber in ruins,

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.980 align:middle line:10%
one of our chambers on
the main site in 1964

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.788 align:middle line:10%
by a researcher
named James Woodall,

00:39:40.788 --> 00:39:42.580 align:middle line:10%
and he actually found
two different stones.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.130 align:middle line:10%
And it sat in our building
for about 11 years

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:10%
as an unknown script
until 1975 when

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.770 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Barry Fell from
Harvard University came up.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at this
stone among a couple others

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.150 align:middle line:90%
and eventually identified it.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:58.150 align:middle line:84%
He translated it as Iberian
Punic, or Phoenician,

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.010 align:middle line:90%
found in Spain and Portugal.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And it said that
temple, that structure,

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:06.610 align:middle line:84%
was dedicated to Baal in
behalf of the Canaanites,

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:09.610 align:middle line:84%
which is what the Phoenicians
would have known themselves as.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:12.460 align:middle line:10%
>>MARZULLI (ON VIDEO): Which
I find absolutely incredible

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:16.060 align:middle line:10%
because the Canaanites,
which is a general term

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.000 align:middle line:10%
for the people
living in the Lavant,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.400 align:middle line:10%
are basically a Nephilim tribe.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
we're on the trail.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.260 align:middle line:90%
That's why we came to this site.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So Baal is the
ancient Canaanite God

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.450 align:middle line:90%
that these entities worship.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Why would the critics say
that it's not genuine?

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Why did the critics
said, well, someone just

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.427 align:middle line:84%
carved this on a
weekend or whatever.

00:40:38.427 --> 00:40:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EXPERT (ON VIDEO): Because
it shouldn't be here.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:44.140 align:middle line:10%
No explorers before Columbus
and no ancient stone ruins

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.610 align:middle line:10%
in the Northeast and--

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:47.027 align:middle line:10%
>>MARZULLI (ON
VIDEO): So anything

00:40:47.027 --> 00:40:49.220 align:middle line:10%
that goes against their
paradigm is dismissed.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.428 align:middle line:90%
>>EXPERT (ON VIDEO): Exactly.

00:40:50.428 --> 00:40:51.890 align:middle line:84%
It's guilty until
proven innocent.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI (ON
VIDEO): Fritz, what

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.160 align:middle line:84%
are your thoughts
when you look at this?

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.827 align:middle line:10%
>>FRITZ ZIMMERMAN (ON
VIDEO): Well, it's

00:40:55.827 --> 00:41:00.010 align:middle line:10%
just another layer of what
we're finding from Middle East.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.680 align:middle line:10%
In our travels, we've already
seen Grave Creek Stone

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.610 align:middle line:10%
which was a form of Hebrew.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:10.520 align:middle line:10%
That creek stone-- so
Hebrew keeps showing up.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
possible that somebody

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.300 align:middle line:84%
who is into these
kinds of studies

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.372 align:middle line:84%
did something like
that 50 years ago?

00:41:19.372 --> 00:41:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah
the Baal Stone was

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:23.650 align:middle line:84%
found on the site
when they started

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:26.890 align:middle line:84%
to excavate one of the chambers
which had never been excavated.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:29.410 align:middle line:84%
It was underneath
about a foot of soil,

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
know what it was.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:31.850 align:middle line:90%
And they took it--

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would?

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well,
it's Iberian Punic.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.197 align:middle line:90%
So they took it.

00:41:35.197 --> 00:41:36.280 align:middle line:90%
They put it in the museum.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.880 align:middle line:90%
It sat there for 11 years.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So if it's a hoax,
how many people

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:44.920 align:middle line:84%
who know Iberian Punic would go
through the trouble of writing

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.000 align:middle line:90%
this thing?

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did anybody
tell Columbus?

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.383 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:47.383 --> 00:41:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So when we were
in the museum, I'm

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:52.930 align:middle line:84%
shooting B-roll with
a little Osmo camera,

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:56.133 align:middle line:84%
and Kelsie Stone, who was
about 24, 25 at the time,

00:41:56.133 --> 00:41:58.300 align:middle line:84%
is taking me around the
museum and showing me stuff,

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.680 align:middle line:90%
and the camera's just on him.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And he gets to where
this thing is kept,

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and he goes, and these are our
dedication stones, the stones

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:05.750 align:middle line:90%
with writing found on the site.

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And the camera's rolling,
and I show this in the film,

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:10.357 align:middle line:84%
and he goes, well,
what's this one say?

00:42:10.357 --> 00:42:11.440 align:middle line:90%
I go, what's this one say?

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well, this
is the dedication stone.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It says, to Baal of the
Canaanites in dedication.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And you hear this
long pause, and I

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.670 align:middle line:90%
go, what did you just say?

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.227 align:middle line:84%
Because he doesn't
know what he's got.

00:42:24.227 --> 00:42:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He doesn't.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: They don't
know what they've got.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting there.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.720 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.460 align:middle line:90%
To Baal of the Canaanites.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, it was
like the Rosetta Stone.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.900 align:middle line:84%
This links the site
directly to the Middle East

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.870 align:middle line:90%
and the Nephilim.

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it does.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Links
it right there.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Way longer
than we thought.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Way longer.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By being on the
trail of the Nephilim,

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:52.290 align:middle line:90%
LA, what does this do for you?

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: It keeps me
busy, that's for sure.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:90%
It keeps me out of trouble.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.400 align:middle line:90%
No, but I love this.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
hope to accomplish?

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.600 align:middle line:10%
>>MARZULLI: I hope to present
a different paradigm to people,

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.640 align:middle line:10%
one that echoes and validates
the biblical prophetic

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.480 align:middle line:10%
narrative, one that shows
that this book is not just

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.010 align:middle line:10%
a bunch of dusty fables and
genealogies and battle scenes,

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.800 align:middle line:10%
but that it is alive,
that the prophecies that

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.120 align:middle line:10%
are written in it are alive.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are happening
even today as we speak.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.960 align:middle line:84%
But it also shows us that the
prince of the power of the air

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.100 align:middle line:84%
had reigned over this entire
planet for a good period

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.550 align:middle line:84%
of time and established
different points of contact

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:36.540 align:middle line:90%
all over this planet.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:40.533 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It also attests then
to the accuracy of the Bible.

00:43:40.533 --> 00:43:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: I think it does.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
amazing all by itself

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.560 align:middle line:84%
because then when you look
at how the universe was

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:52.030 align:middle line:84%
formed in Genesis, Noah's
Ark, all this, it's all true.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah.

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:57.030 align:middle line:84%
It's all true, and the problem
most people have is they

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:90%
look at it as a religion.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking
about religion.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about relationship,

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and that's a whole
different deal.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So I've talked about
this on your show.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Monks with funny
haircuts and rosary beads

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and robes and medallions
and stained glass windows.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.710 align:middle line:84%
All that are the
trappings of men.

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:15.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not what it's about.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it safe to
say you're obsessed?

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah, I'm
definitely obsessed.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: LA, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Thank you, George.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.685 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, you know
what, he is obsessed,

00:44:23.685 --> 00:44:25.980 align:middle line:10%
but it's great because
he's getting answers for us

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:30.600 align:middle line:10%
that we don't get any place else
on the trail of the Nephilim.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
