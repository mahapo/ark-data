00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Our guest today
is investigative reporter Paola

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Harris.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And she has been studying
extraterrestrial-related

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:84%
phenomena since 1979, and has
traveled all over the planet

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:90%
studying UFOs.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.820 align:middle line:10%
And recently, she went hunting
for giants in Sardinia.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.233 align:middle line:90%
Paola, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA HARRIS: It's
great to be here, George.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.233 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be with you.

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's it like
to go giant hunting?

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, it makes it
sound like it's a lot of fun.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
But it all happened
serendipitously in 2009.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I happened to be doing a
conference in Sardinia.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.553 align:middle line:84%
And after the conference, a
farmer named Luigi Muscas said,

00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:90%
I want you to come out and--

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Luigi Musca?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Muscas.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And he said,
come to my farm, he said,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:10%
because I have
something to show you.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:10%
And so I did.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.470 align:middle line:10%
And he introduced
me to his father

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:10%
and his uncle, who are
no longer with us--

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.540 align:middle line:10%
thank god I've got the photos.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:10%
And they told me an incredible
story about how, in the 1960s,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:10%
so many people, including
Luigi when he was a child,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:10%
discovered 15 foot-tall
skeletons complete in caves.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:10%
And within two years,
the authorities

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.945 align:middle line:10%
came and took them all away.

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Aha!

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I said, well,
tell me something about this.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:90%
I know!

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.942 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I was
coming home from school,

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:90%
and all my classmates, we went--

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
with a couple of classmates,
we went into this cave.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And there was this 15
foot-tall skeleton.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Now, imagine the head.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:90%
Imagine, he said.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:90%
We would play with the arms.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:84%
We would pull the
tendons in the fingers.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And this was our
fun thing to do.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:84%
And since they were
about 12 years old,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:90%
they told their families.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the families
started looking on the land

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and unearthed all
kinds of bones.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:10%
But I said, well, where's
all of this stuff?

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:10%
And they said they came
and confiscated them.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.460 align:middle line:10%
And he said, a number
of farmers have

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.470 align:middle line:10%
been threatened
with their lives,

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.360 align:middle line:10%
because it is forbidden science.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't fit into
regular anthropology.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back a
little bit, Paola.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:84%
You're an Italo-American
investigative reporter.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:84%
How did you get started
investigating UFOs?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, it was
one of those things.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.495 align:middle line:90%
I had a master's in education.

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:90%
I was teaching English.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:84%
In 1979, they gave me a
class called science-fiction.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:90%
And "Close Encounters" came out.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Great movie.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: That's all it took.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great movie.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:90%
And the book, too.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Great movie.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to see
"Close Encounters,"

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and I began to ask
who was behind it.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said, J. Allen Hynek
happened to be the consultant.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
By accident, I was in a
wedding in Evanston, Illinois.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my family,
you don't come with me,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going over to the
Center for UFO studies

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and look at their files
to see if this is real.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.345 align:middle line:84%
And there's J. Allen
Hynek with his pipe.

00:03:22.345 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, perfect.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: He had his pipe.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
He comes out and he
says, my secretary

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:90%
says you understand Italian.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.690 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.320 align:middle line:90%
He said, well, you work with me.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.735 align:middle line:90%
And thought, work with you?

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:36.193 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
a gift from God.

00:03:36.193 --> 00:03:36.993 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: God.

00:03:36.993 --> 00:03:38.270 align:middle line:90%
That's how it started.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:84%
For-- until he died in '86,
he would come to Boulder,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.600 align:middle line:90%
I would drive him around.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:90%
We met in New Mexico.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I worked with the best
of the best, George.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was an astronomer.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:90%
And he would--

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a
skeptic who changed.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: "Project
Blue Book," right--

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:90%
who changed.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And he-- in the later
part of his life,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:84%
he began to connect the
phenomena with the paranormal,

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:84%
as Jacques Bergier
does in all his books.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:90%
And he grew.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And the thinking
of the phenomenon

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:90%
is more of the nuts and bolts.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:90%
In those days, I couldn't do it.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:84%
Because in those days,
nuts and bolts was safe.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:84%
I could put pins in maps, I
could look at the soil samples,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:90%
and do all that kind of stuff.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
But today, I've gone way
past that, and I understand,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.232 align:middle line:90%
it is dimensional.

00:04:31.232 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though
you specialize

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.870 align:middle line:84%
in investigating UFOs, you don't
consider yourself a ufologist.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You consider
yourself more

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:90%
as an investigative reporter.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.588 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
because a ufologist

00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:84%
has a preconceived notion
that you're dealing with UFOs.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm an
investigative reporter.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So in my case--
because we're going

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.530 align:middle line:84%
to cover a couple of cases
that are controversial.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:84%
It's my obligation
to look at all of it.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.440 align:middle line:90%
In some of these cases--

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:90%
like the Billy Meier case.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:84%
People-- most of my colleagues
dissed the whole thing.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I have to see it
as a journalist.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:90%
I have to cover the story.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:84%
You can decide after if
it's real or not real.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you never
cover the story,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:84%
you don't have any
kind of concept.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:90%
You have gossip.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:90%
You have hearsay.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Everything in my
career I've ever done,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I have covered in
person, on location.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.843 align:middle line:84%
And you've called me, I know,
boots on the ground person.

00:05:28.843 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't see how you could
do it any other way.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So as a journalist-- and Jaime
Maussan is like that, too.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.275 align:middle line:90%
He's got to cover everything.

00:05:36.275 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:84%
For him to say "I don't
feel like doing that"

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.263 align:middle line:90%
doesn't sound real.

00:05:40.263 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how can you do that?

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like doing
that story because everyone

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:90%
will criticize me.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what journalists do.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.510 align:middle line:84%
They cover the
story, and then you

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:84%
decide-- and especially for
a scientist-- if it's real.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are a
couple of the UFO cases

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.030 align:middle line:84%
that you've looked at that
are just overwhelming for you,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:90%
that you just love?

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, the problem
is that they've come to me.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:84%
I've come to-- and the
50th anniversary of Roswell

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.200 align:middle line:84%
introduced me to
Colonel Philip Corso.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I came from Italy,
I had no place to stay.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:10%
I was in panic mode
because my boss, Maurizzio,

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.440 align:middle line:10%
wanted me to cover the story.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
They told me at the
press club, they

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
said, just open up a phone
book and get a place.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:90%
I opened up the phone book.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
There was one room
at Sally Port.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.176 align:middle line:84%
It was right next to
Colonel Philip Corso.

00:06:32.176 --> 00:06:32.562 align:middle line:90%
He was right next door.

00:06:32.562 --> 00:06:33.362 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:06:33.362 --> 00:06:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Right next to his room?

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know that.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
that I went to the museum.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.048 align:middle line:90%
He was doing a--

00:06:42.048 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had his book come out?

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: His book--

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "The Day
After Roswell"?

00:06:44.105 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: That's why
everybody went there,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.200 align:middle line:10%
"The Day After Roswell."

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:10%
Because that was a big party.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.093 align:middle line:10%
And Simon and Shuster had--

00:06:50.093 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:10%
I mean, everybody was there.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:90%
John Mack was there.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:90%
Michael Hesemann was there.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:90%
Everybody in the world was--

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Bud Hopkins, Linda Hopkins.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was there.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
that I went to the museum.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I saw Colonel Corso doing
the press conference.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.620 align:middle line:84%
This blond guy in the audience
said, you're from Italy?

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:90%
And I said yes.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:84%
He goes, ask my father
a question in Italian.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, you're Corso's son?

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:90%
He said yes.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:90%
He said, he speaks Italian.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:84%
He was the head of
intelligence in 1945.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I'm too nervous,
because all of the cameras

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:90%
are here.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And he took his hand and he
pushed me into the crowd,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:90%
and I had no choice.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.660 align:middle line:84%
In Italian, I asked him
about the Santilli footage--

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:90%
about the alien--

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ray Santilli.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:90%
The alien autopsy.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:10%
And he answered-- he said, look.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:84%
He said, it appears to
be real to me, he said,

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
because the taking off of
the lens of the being--

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:84%
when you take off the
lens of the being,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.400 align:middle line:84%
there's an eyeball
underneath it.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:90%
He said, and I had that lens.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, I had that lens
as part of the artifacts

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.200 align:middle line:84%
that we back-engineered
for night screening.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:10%
And then he said to somebody,
I want to speak to her.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.020 align:middle line:10%
And then he came up to me he
said, I want to talk to you.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.540 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know he was
in the room next to me.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:10%
And from that point on, I
brought him to Italy twice.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:90%
I got to know him very well.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And my latest book is
called Conversations

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.865 align:middle line:90%
with Colonel Corso.

00:08:20.865 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.645 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And it's
all audiotapes.

00:08:22.645 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:10%
Good guy.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.897 align:middle line:10%
And he wrote that
book with Bill Birnes,

00:08:25.897 --> 00:08:28.070 align:middle line:10%
which was a bestseller,
which really

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:10%
changed the face of ufology
when it first came out.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: It did.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:10%
Because, at that time,
I didn't know why

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:10%
the secret was being secret.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:90%
I said, is it religion?

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:84%
Are they worried that we're
going to have an invasion?

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:42.774 align:middle line:90%
Are the aliens evil?

00:08:42.774 --> 00:08:43.574 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why?

00:08:43.574 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
lose control of us?

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So when I read the book, and
when he told me that the army--

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:90%
he was in the army.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, the army and Air
Force split in 1948.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:90%
He's in the army.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:84%
The army got the
artifacts in the 1960s,

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:01.670 align:middle line:84%
during the Kennedy
administration,

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:90%
when he was with Trudeau.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:84%
He talked about,
in detail, how they

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.210 align:middle line:90%
back-engineered that stuff.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, oh,
it's about money.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:90%
It's about back-engineering.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:90%
It's about technology.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.820 align:middle line:90%
That is the most--

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
that's probably the
most logical answer

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.670 align:middle line:90%
why the secret is secret.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about our colleagues--

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Lamb is an expert in
hypnotherapy and investigating

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.140 align:middle line:90%
people who have been abducted.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.685 align:middle line:84%
She had a chance to
talk with us about that.

00:09:32.685 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Barbara, what
would you say is happening?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:10%
I mean, these are wild things--

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:10%
visitations, healings.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:10%
What do you think
the bottom line is?

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.702 align:middle line:10%
What's the agenda here?

00:09:44.702 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:10%
>>BARBARA LAMB:
Well, I think there

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:10%
are many different agendas.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:10%
But the overall one is that
beings out there in space--

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.200 align:middle line:10%
who we may know about
or may not know about--

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.917 align:middle line:10%
they are very, very
interested in this planet.

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wonder why.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.792 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: And in humanity.

00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are we that special?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.910 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: Well, one of
the extraterrestrials

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:10%
told my clients that-- this came
out in channeling that she did.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:10%
This extraterrestrial
said that Earth

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:10%
is a unique planet among
all of the planets in all

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:10%
of the solar systems,
all of the universes,

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:10%
because we have
more species of life

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:10%
here on Earth than all
of the other planets

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:10%
have species put together.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Combined?

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.458 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: We have more on
this one small planet--

00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:46.292 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We're the
hodgepodge of everything.

00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:47.360 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: Yeah.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.110 align:middle line:10%
And when you think about
it, we do have species,

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.690 align:middle line:10%
and subspecies,
and sub-subspecies,

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.395 align:middle line:10%
and oh, my goodness.

00:10:55.395 --> 00:10:56.195 align:middle line:10%
It's amazing.

00:10:56.195 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've always
wondered that, though.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:10%
You're right.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:02.180 align:middle line:10%
We have the insect world, the
animal world, the human world.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.470 align:middle line:10%
There's so many-- the fish.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.100 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: The ocean world, yes.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:10%
We do.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.930 align:middle line:10%
The mammals, the
reptiles, the amphibians.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:10%
It goes on and on and on, So
that's one of the reasons.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:10%
Also, the Earth itself
has so many different

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:10%
features that a lot of
the planets don't have.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:10%
And we have our oceans.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:10%
We have our lakes, our rivers--

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They don't have this?

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: --our
mountains, our minerals.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:10%
We are rich in minerals that
some of the other planets

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:10%
don't have, or don't
have as much as we do.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:10%
And they're very
interested in humans.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:10%
One of the reasons is because
we have so much more emotional

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:54.623 align:middle line:10%
capability than most of the
other beings in existence.

00:11:54.623 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paola, what do you
think of her assessment?

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I think she's amazing.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:90%
She--

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.753 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great work.

00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Great work.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And she's also accumulated
it over the years.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of
the situations here,

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
but I also think that not
all of the visitations

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:90%
are interplanetary.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I think we have a lot of
inter-dimensional activity,

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of paranormal activity,
which people can look at as--

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.410 align:middle line:84%
that they shoved together
with the UFO phenomenon.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's all of it.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:90%
It's consciousness.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
If I had to-- see, now, in
2020, my conferences that I do

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.240 align:middle line:90%
are basically on consciousness.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:90%
On consciousness raising.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness is the glue
that puts together all of this.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:84%
This is a teaching mechanism
for the human being

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:90%
to know who he is, who we are.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:10%
Because it's not just
coming and testing us,

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:10%
it's making us grow up.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I've had a chance to
interview numerous times

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Michael Horn, who's the US
representative for Billy

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Meier of Switzerland.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Billy just turned 83 years old.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who has taken
some incredible UFO photographs

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:90%
for years and years and years.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.610 align:middle line:84%
He's escaped 20-some
assassination attempts

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:15.720 align:middle line:90%
on his life.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Truly remarkable.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.210 align:middle line:84%
What do you think of
the Billy Meier case?

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Well, I don't think.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:10%
I had to go out and
research it, because I don't

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:10%
know how to operate on opinion.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Italy,
three Italians and I--

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're cold and
calculated, aren't you?

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.617 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah-- no--
well, because, opinion--

00:13:30.617 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:84%
it's like, opinion
based on what?

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.850 align:middle line:90%
On what people say?

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.235 align:middle line:84%
Because, George those pictures
couldn't be photoshopped.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.035 align:middle line:10%
That's 1970.

00:13:40.035 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:10%
Photoshop came--

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They didn't have
that kind of stuff then.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:10%
1992 was Photoshop.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, use logic.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:90%
Photoshop is '92.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:90%
1974, these pictures come out.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:84%
But more than that, I went
to see Wendellee Stephens--

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Colonel Wendellee Stephens.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And I sat with him for five
hours in the Tucson airport

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:84%
for him to tell me about
his research on Meier.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And he told me.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.418 align:middle line:90%
He said, I lived there.

00:14:04.418 --> 00:14:06.180 align:middle line:90%
He said, they would call him.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:90%
He said it was snowing.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:90%
Billy would go out the door.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
His footprints would
disappear after--

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Disappear?

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --from the snow.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:84%
You see his footprints,
then you see no footprints.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where'd they go?

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They took him.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.320 align:middle line:90%
And he said they would call--

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and he would call, and he
was, like, five towns over,

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and they had to go
and retrieve him.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.437 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So the
guy is not lying.

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.038 align:middle line:90%
Wendellee is not lying.

00:14:34.038 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I think he's one of the greatest
researchers that ever lived.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's very good.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.188 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, he was amazing.

00:14:38.188 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And he's Colonel--
he was a colonel.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that, when he did
that story with Brit and Lee

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Elders, they lived there.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:90%
They did it well.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:10%
So when I went
with the Italians--

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:10%
today, Billy Meier is--

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:10%
he's watched over by FIGU, which
is a group of people that don't

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.737 align:middle line:10%
let you very close to him.

00:15:00.737 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They protect him.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They protect him.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.260 align:middle line:90%
And you have to go through them.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And they have-- they
have their own agenda.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
I can honestly say I don't
agree with the agenda.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
However, I was there
for a whole day.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can go
there on a Sunday.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:90%
It's Schmidrüti.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the German
part of Switzerland.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:90%
It's open to the general public.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was, I
was there talking to them

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.067 align:middle line:90%
Billy was over in the corner.

00:15:27.067 --> 00:15:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And they told me they couldn't
talk to us anymore because they

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:84%
were going to have a
peace ceremony in German--

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:84%
because they believe German
is the most perfect language.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And we're Italian.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So I said-- they said, go
down in the Simyazi garden

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:90%
and come back in an hour.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, I went down
with the Italians

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and we started
meditating for peace.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I see Billy
coming right towards me.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And he's coming-- and I don't
know why he wasn't meditating.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:84%
But he came-- and he came really
close to me. he looked at me.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And within minutes, he sent
me with Guido Moosbrugger,

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:84%
who is the man that wrote the
book on Billy-- he's a doctor--

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.690 align:middle line:84%
"And Still They Fly," which I
consider the most valid book

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And what's-his-name,
Moosbrugger, came up and said,

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Billy Meier sent
me to talk to you.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.790 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want to answer
any questions you have.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's got one arm.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:16.443 align:middle line:90%
Billy's got one arm.

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And Guido Moosbrugger,
the doctor,

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.970 align:middle line:84%
said, he wants you to have all
your answers that you need,

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:90%
he said.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.062 align:middle line:84%
Because he doesn't speak
English all that well and he--

00:16:28.062 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:90%
And so he spent time with us.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And we saw those
things in the book.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
We saw the hole inside the
tree that he had used--

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:38.890 align:middle line:90%
some kind of weapon.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
We saw that he
lived in a commune.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:90%
We saw a lot of things.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But that's-- and I know that, at
some point, you get the truth,

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:84%
in ufology, and then you
get the contamination.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So when you get
the contamination,

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.180 align:middle line:84%
you throw everything
out, and nobody even

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.770 align:middle line:90%
wants to deal with this.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.115 align:middle line:90%
And the situation-- to tell-

00:16:59.115 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once it's
contaminated, it's contaminated.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's over.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's done.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And everybody--
hoax, hoax, hoax.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:90%
And I say, oh, really?

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Did you bother to see why you
would bother with one arm?

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And did you know that Billy
Meier spent years in India,

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:90%
just like Adamsky did?

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Both of them spent
years in India.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So they are perfect for
contact because they

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:90%
have that mentality.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I do believe
Colonel Wendelle Stevens--

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.900 align:middle line:90%
he worked on the case.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And the excuse they use is,
the pictures are too good.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a great excuse.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.580 align:middle line:84%
It was staged, because
the Pleiadians wanted

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.740 align:middle line:90%
to stage the photography.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Speaking
of pictures, we've

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:84%
got three stills
that Billy has taken.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at some of them.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at this first
Billy Meier picture.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:84%
You've seen this one
before, haven't you?

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:10%
I've seen it.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle line:10%
I went to the place
where it was taken.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:10%
Because I went to three
different locations

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:10%
where these photos were taken.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to see,
myself, the locations.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.470 align:middle line:10%
And they're gorgeous.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
taken in Switzerland?

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.475 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:18:02.475 --> 00:18:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Exact location.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of a craft is that?

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Well, they say that--

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.620 align:middle line:84%
you have to look at what
he says that they told him.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a scout
craft of some kind.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:90%
But they had different models.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:90%
And it was staged.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a stage--

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.438 align:middle line:84%
in other words, is they
said, set up your camera.

00:18:20.438 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do it
for you so that you're

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
going to go out and tell the
outside world that we exist.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Because people say
it's too clear,

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.837 align:middle line:90%
they're too good-- of course.

00:18:31.837 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
an agenda behind it.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And the agenda was
that, in the 1970s,

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that we open up ufology to the
idea that human-type aliens--

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:90%
human-- because that's--

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Semjase and her father,
are visiting the planet.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks like
a Roman church cathedral

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:90%
at the top of that thing.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it?

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
You expect the pope to come
out of that little hole.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It is
very ornate, yes.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Actually, it
looks like there's an ET

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:90%
standing on the top of it.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Actually,
I never saw that.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You see
that little thing?

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:90%
It seems like a person.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Looks like a little
person standing up there.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: On the
left-hand side, right?

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.527 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: That's the first--

00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:15.455 align:middle line:84%
George, it's the first
time I've seen that.

00:19:15.455 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.882 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: That's amazing.

00:19:16.882 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
It seems like a person standing
right on the top of it.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
at the second picture we've

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:10%
got here of Billy Meier and
get your thoughts on this one.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:25.860 align:middle line:10%
That one--

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is dramatic.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.182 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And this is dramatic.

00:19:28.182 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:10%
But there are three different
ones, and they say, oh, no,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.880 align:middle line:10%
what they did was take a
model and just shove it

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:10%
on the side of the tree.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:10%
No, because there
are three other ones

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.392 align:middle line:10%
of it going around the tree.

00:19:40.392 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:10%
And then when I was
there, they showed me

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:10%
movies of that particular craft
with the highway underneath

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:10%
and the cars going
on the highway.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.835 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I said,
where are the movies?

00:19:50.835 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we sold
them to the Japanese.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So the Japanese got all
of Billy Meier's movies.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:90%
They got the piece of metal.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.260 align:middle line:90%
They got the photographs.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And I found out, in my
research, that if there's

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:84%
something that's this
clear, the Japanese

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
are the first to come
and buy everything.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at the third photo.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:90%
I went to this place.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's one
of my favorites.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I actually stood
here, without the craft,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.130 align:middle line:90%
with my three Italian friends.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at this,
and we're taking pictures

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:84%
without the craft,
because I wanted

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.890 align:middle line:84%
to see-- there is no
way there's a fishhook.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.710 align:middle line:84%
There is no way
that's superimposed.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:90%
We're dealing with 1970s.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Again, this was staged to tell
the world that this was real.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.030 align:middle line:84%
But then the Swiss
government did not

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.842 align:middle line:84%
like all the pilgrims
that went up there.

00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Because when you do that,
then everybody in the world

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
gets in their cameras
and goes up there.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Swiss government is
not excited about that.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And right away, the story
is going to be killed.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And so unfortunately, that's
what happened with Billy Meier.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:00.680 align:middle line:84%
But I suggest people read
"And Still They Fly,"

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:84%
because that is the book that
really covers the details.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Paola, his
ex-wife, Kalliope,

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:10%
claims that some of these
photographs have been hoaxed.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Michael Horn tells me
it's a woman scorned.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:90%
No, I know.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Because we made a mistake.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:10%
We filmed a child while we were
there that we didn't realize

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:10%
was his daughter by somebody
who he had an affair

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:10%
with inside the commune.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.926 align:middle line:10%
The wife got really upset.

00:21:29.926 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Yes, the
wife was not excited.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.880 align:middle line:10%
This has happened with a
lot of contactees, George,

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:10%
unfortunately, even
with a lot of--

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Can't blame her, maybe.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:90%
You can't--

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --blame her for
being upset about it.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.998 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because
it was a commune.

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And we saw this child,
and they told us

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
later, no, that's his daughter
by this woman he had an affair

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.645 align:middle line:90%
with inside the commune.

00:21:47.645 --> 00:21:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Because there were
women and men.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: While still married.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.200 align:middle line:10%
This happens.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.608 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That explains it.

00:21:53.608 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: I agree with Michael.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:10%
I know it's fact.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.360 align:middle line:10%
I saw the child.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.000 align:middle line:10%
I understand how a
woman could be angry.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the first
contactee this has happened to.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're not very wise.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And doesn't mean, just
because you're a contactee,

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:84%
you're pure, wonderful,
saint-like, and so forth.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.950 align:middle line:90%
And I think that was a mistake.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.070 align:middle line:10%
But his son Methuselah
supports him.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:10%
So what do you say?

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the wife may be upset,
but the son supports him 100%.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: His son backs him up.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:84%
What does the field
of you followed

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:90%
to say about Billy Meier?

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, they
won't even look at it.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:90%
And neither will--

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
think anything's weird.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --a lot
of the guys that I

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:84%
work with that are top-level
ufologists that are scientists.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.470 align:middle line:84%
They won't even-- they
say Billy Meier hoax.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like saying, when
you made the judgment like that,

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:84%
how how deep have you
gone into this story?

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.897 align:middle line:84%
When you decide if something
is a hoax or not, how deep--

00:22:49.897 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:90%
have you been there?

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Have you talked to the person?

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Have you made your own judgment?

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, George,
though-- you know this.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking to
somebody face-to-face--

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:90%
I did the Charles Hall case.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I was the first to
want to do that.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:03.272 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:03.272 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:90%
That was a huge case.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.622 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It took me two years.

00:23:04.622 --> 00:23:06.870 align:middle line:84%
You can tell, by
looking at them,

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:84%
if they're telling
the truth or not.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:90%
You get a real good impression.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Unless they're very pathological
and good at it, you can tell.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:90%
So you went to Sardinia.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I went
with Regina Meredith

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:90%
and the crew, Freddy Silva.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I couldn't do
forbidden archaeology.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.170 align:middle line:90%
That's not my expertise.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So Luigi said, Paola,
bring people back.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:84%
His father and his uncle
had died, but thank god,

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:90%
I had them on audiotape.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And I took Regina Meredith and
Freddy Silva, and the crew,

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:90%
and we went there.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And from her
show on "Open Minds,"

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:84%

and Luigi Muscas, a
leading researcher

pointing to the connection
between the island of Sardinia

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:10%
and the ancient
culture of Atlantis.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:10%
Their elaborate stone sites--

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.750 align:middle line:10%
roughly 7,000 of them--

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:10%
are sprinkled all over the
island, revealing tombs, bones,

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:10%
and highly sophisticated
architecture.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.780 align:middle line:10%
It's speculated that
people from Atlantis,

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:10%
including a giant
race of people,

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.660 align:middle line:10%
emigrated to Sardinia, with
their great knowledge leaving

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:10%
their tombs and temples--

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:10%
called naragi-- behind.

and the writings of Edgar
Cayce and Ruth Montgomery,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.770 align:middle line:10%
Why did they disappear?

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:10%
And how many more are there
buried under the sands of time?

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.137 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.137 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think the world
of Freddy Silva, Paola.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.095 align:middle line:90%
Isn't he a great guy?

00:25:24.095 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It was wonderful
to be with them, yes.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, they were
talking about bone samples?

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, you saw
Luigi in this clip.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:10%
And basically, he brought
them to the actual cave

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:10%
where he saw the
entire skeleton.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:84%
But on his property,
they unearthed

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:48.030 align:middle line:84%
actual pieces of femur,
of shoulder, of teeth.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big was this giant?

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: 15 feet.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.020 align:middle line:10%
15 feet.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.300 align:middle line:10%
Fully assembled, 15 feet.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And so Luigi has these
precious artifacts.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:90%
And he gave me a sample--

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No way.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --of a femur.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Which, in the end,
needs to be tested--

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
from the giants
that lived there.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Now, that is a reality.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.655 align:middle line:84%
That isn't a
hypothetical situation.

00:26:12.655 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We need to
keep it in the case

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.905 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
to contaminate it.

00:26:15.905 --> 00:26:17.488 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, that
is it a sterile--

00:26:17.488 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll be the
DNA giant evidence.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It is a
sterile environment,

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:90%
because it needs to be.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
science works, really.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be looked
at for the DNA.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.430 align:middle line:84%
We know it's a reality because
we have witness testimony,

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:37.380 align:middle line:84%
as we do with UFOs, which
is the most important thing.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Thank god that I talked to
his father and his uncle, who

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:90%
saw these bones also--

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.370 align:middle line:84%
to other people that
came from all over.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And they had-- in
the trunk of the car,

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.680 align:middle line:84%
they had giant bones
from on their property.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.413 align:middle line:84%
Because Sardinia is not
a very populated island.

00:26:53.413 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, it's not.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I'm going
back this summer, George.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Because Luigi wants to talk to
me about UFO sightings there.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
interesting too.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Might these giants
be UFO inhabitants?

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.282 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He thinks
they're from the stars.

00:27:07.282 --> 00:27:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could
be interesting.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: People from the stars.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:84%
He calls them the
people from the stars.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said he has seen tubes
come down from the sky--

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Polly,
the paranormal stuff

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that happens around here,
you'd never believe.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:84%
It's also dimension
portholes-- portals.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:28.980 align:middle line:90%
It's all of it.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.930 align:middle line:90%
And he asked me to come back.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, on a personal level,
I'd like you to come back,

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk
about the UFO part.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.930 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, yeah.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not good, maybe, at
the archeological part,

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.205 align:middle line:84%
but I certainly am
interested in UFOs.

00:27:41.205 --> 00:27:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you are.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Why does it seem that
there's a shroud of secrecy

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.710 align:middle line:84%
about giants throughout
the history of this planet?

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're told that
the Smithsonian has giants

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:90%
in the basement-- skeletons.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:90%
But everything's suppressed.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:90%
This is a great story.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.298 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you just
come public with it?

00:28:02.298 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Actually, with all
the history of the planet,

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.790 align:middle line:90%
we would have to rewrite it.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And it would be a problem for
those institutions that have

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:90%
what they think is the truth.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.640 align:middle line:84%
As far as the Smithsonian,
Italy did a show on it

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and actually showed
the assembled, 15

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:90%
foot-tall skeleton they have.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:20.898 align:middle line:90%
So Italy was even--

00:28:20.898 --> 00:28:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They look
human-like, right?

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.800 align:middle line:90%
It's just a human figure--

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just a big,
human-looking person.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, but then what?

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.230 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go look
at Greek mythology.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to look at the
stories of Greek mythology,

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and we're going,
is that history?

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Was that real?

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the problem that
archaeologists have is,

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.105 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
where to fit it in.

00:28:41.105 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't know--
because they're

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.000 align:middle line:84%
looking at life as
linear, and they

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:84%
don't know where to fit
in-- this is an anomaly.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't belong there.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like
UFOs are an anomaly.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.700 align:middle line:90%
They don't belong there.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's easier to
take them all away.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:90%
And they did, in Sardinia.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Luigi told me, there's
a couple of rooms

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:90%
where he's seen the skeletons--

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:84%
the head of these beings, that
they're keeping them hidden.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't fit in
to mainstream anything.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
that, then people

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:90%
start questioning our origins.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, questioning
our origins is a problem.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do the
people of Sardinia

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.872 align:middle line:90%
say about these apparent giants?

00:29:23.872 --> 00:29:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They're used to it.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.120 align:middle line:90%
They find them in their fields.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.140 align:middle line:90%
There's stories about them.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think Freddy
Silva covers it too.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
theory that there

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.230 align:middle line:84%
were survivors of Atlantis
that landed in Sardinia.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Because they have a culture
that refers to Atlantis,

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.740 align:middle line:90%
to advanced technologies.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So our history of the planet
that you read in history books

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:90%
needs to be rewritten.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.810 align:middle line:90%
It's all mixed up.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.730 align:middle line:90%
There's big gaps.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:84%
There's new discoveries
that somehow--

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:90%
maybe past our lifetimes--

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:06.060 align:middle line:84%
will be put in to fulfill
the mystery, to look

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:90%
at the whole entire picture.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Truly amazing.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:84%
When you go back
there, are you going

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.340 align:middle line:90%
to look for anything specific?

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I'm
interested in the UFO part.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And Luigi was
telling me there are

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.530 align:middle line:84%
places where there's sightings--
very clear daylight sightings

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ongoing?

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, ongoing.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you might
be able to witness one.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I was there, at
night-- around midnight,

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:84%
what happens is, I've had
several military men come in

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.670 align:middle line:84%
from the NATO bases
and tell me they've

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.720 align:middle line:90%
had sightings over the base.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So I go, OK, what are they
doing over the NATO bases?

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.113 align:middle line:10%
What are UFOs doing over NATO
bases in the Mediterranean?

00:30:44.113 --> 00:30:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
go there on vacation.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a power play.

00:30:46.905 --> 00:30:47.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a power play.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's saying, yeah--

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They want us--

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Here we are.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.983 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to know,
here we are, and there's

00:30:50.983 --> 00:30:52.860 align:middle line:90%
nothing you can do about it.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
Robert Hastings before,

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:84%
who's talked about UFOs
over our missile silos.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing we can do.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.708 align:middle line:90%
They shut them down.

00:31:01.708 --> 00:31:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: That's exactly right.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's lot going
on in the Mediterranean.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And the sightings, the men
that come in to speak to me--

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, I just
take their testimony--

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:15.523 align:middle line:84%
say it's amazing, because
we don't know what to do.

00:31:15.523 --> 00:31:16.440 align:middle line:90%
You can't do anything.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.440 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to do?

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a sighting.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.170 align:middle line:90%
They didn't bomb you.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.220 align:middle line:90%
They didn't do anything.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:90%
They didn't dismantle anything.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Right now, even though I
think that the Robert Salas

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and Hastings have real
information that the world

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.410 align:middle line:84%
should know, that maybe
whoever is visiting us

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.490 align:middle line:90%
is giving us a message.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they're
trying to protect our future.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I hope we
protect our future.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.605 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not
sure we're going

00:31:43.605 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do that
without some help.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Not in the direction
we've been going.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:52.040 align:middle line:84%
When you were in Sardinia,
were you in awe with the things

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.590 align:middle line:90%
that they told you?

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:84%
The archaeological part
doesn't fit into anything I do.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So I gave that to
other people to study.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.162 align:middle line:90%
But the UFO part--

00:32:00.162 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael Cremo would
have been great for that, too.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.620 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, and Klaus Dona.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.817 align:middle line:84%
Klaus Dona actually
kept in touch with us

00:32:06.817 --> 00:32:08.150 align:middle line:90%
and said, what did you find out?

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.190 align:middle line:90%
What did you find out?

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.350 align:middle line:84%
He's in the
Philippines right now.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to
know, I just do one thing.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:15.620 align:middle line:90%
I do the UFO thing.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So even though I
helped with that,

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a background.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an authority on it.

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:84%
But I am interested
in the sightings,

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.890 align:middle line:84%
the timing of the
sightings, where they are.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that
all of this gives us

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.220 align:middle line:84%
a very clear and present
message that we are still

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:90%
being visited.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when were you
and Regina in Sardinia?

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.740 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Last May.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:84%
The end of May, the
beginning of June.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And the person that
took us around,

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Rosella, is a very
close friend of mine.

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to be
seeing her again.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.307 align:middle line:84%
And the secret is to go to
the people that live there.

00:32:51.307 --> 00:32:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And they know
everything, because it's

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.375 align:middle line:90%
word-of-mouth tradition.

00:32:55.375 --> 00:32:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And why would they lie?

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Why would they lie?

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.818 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: They're not
used to television,

00:32:59.818 --> 00:33:01.110 align:middle line:10%
and they're not used to media.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want a lot of people

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:03.060 align:middle line:84%
trooping through there
and stuff like that.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.618 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, they don't.

00:33:04.618 --> 00:33:06.660 align:middle line:10%
They don't want it to
become a tourist attraction

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.730 align:middle line:10%
with t-shirts and
all that stuff.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.590 align:middle line:90%
That is their history.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, George, I
have transferred my research

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:15.497 align:middle line:90%
to Latin America.

00:33:15.497 --> 00:33:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have done that now?

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.270 align:middle line:10%
I don't work in
the States anymore.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I did not know that.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:23.513 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because,
for me, in the field--

00:33:23.513 --> 00:33:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and I've been in
it for 40 years--

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:27.510 align:middle line:84%
it's become too much of
an entertainment field.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:32.070 align:middle line:10%
I need to talk to the peasants,
to the workers, to the farmers,

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.990 align:middle line:10%
to the old people.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.790 align:middle line:90%
I need to speak--

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Serious research.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Serious research.

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, they
don't have any agenda.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:90%
I was in Peru.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I was in near
Huascaran in Ancash,

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.020 align:middle line:90%
and I'm in a bed and breakfast.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Very, very Spartan place.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.920 align:middle line:90%
And the lady is cooking a meal.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.587 align:middle line:84%
And I walk over to her-- she's
got one of those kerchiefs on.

00:33:56.587 --> 00:33:57.420 align:middle line:90%
She's all bent over.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And I say, did you ever
see an extraterrestrial?

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.560 align:middle line:90%
She says, yeah.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.750 align:middle line:84%
She says, they have a
base on that mountain

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.020 align:middle line:90%
over there, Huascaran.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.350 align:middle line:84%
She says, and when my
children were 10 years old,

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:11.340 align:middle line:84%
two spacemen came into their
bedroom to talk to them.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.600 align:middle line:90%
She's not lying.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.040 align:middle line:10%
I said, two spacemen came
into your children's bedroom?

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
we're used to that.

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:23.760 align:middle line:84%
She said, they come while
we're working in the fields.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.520 align:middle line:84%
We see them-- we see their
ships during the day.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, really?

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:33.690 align:middle line:10%
And I have to go to those
places, where those people who

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.960 align:middle line:10%
have nothing to lose are
telling me about what's

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.295 align:middle line:10%
going on in Latin America.

00:34:39.295 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I had a chance to investigate a
friend of yours, Jaime Maussan,

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:47.277 align:middle line:84%
about what is called the
Friendship Case in Italy.

00:34:47.277 --> 00:34:49.610 align:middle line:10%
>>JAIME MAUSSAN: It was very
difficult for them to talk.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.989 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it was very--

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:52.400 align:middle line:10%
they didn't want to.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.699 align:middle line:10%
But Bruno Sammaciccia,
the man who

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:59.060 align:middle line:10%
was the leader of this
group, died in 2003.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.190 align:middle line:10%
And he asked them
now to open the case.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:06.440 align:middle line:10%
And the first one was the
Stefano Breccia in 2007.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.940 align:middle line:10%
And that's when the world
learned about this case.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.450 align:middle line:10%
It's very important that
American investigators--

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.430 align:middle line:10%
field investigators--

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:20.540 align:middle line:10%
got interested in this
case, go to Italy,

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.050 align:middle line:10%
and tried to convince themselves
how important this case was.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:25.240 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:10%
>>MAN: For some time
now, Jaime Maussan

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.970 align:middle line:10%
has been traveling to
Italy to find and interview

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.910 align:middle line:10%
the participants of what could
be the largest mass contact

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.800 align:middle line:10%
program in the
history of humanity.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.080 align:middle line:10%
It was known as Amicizia, which
means friendship in Italian.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.840 align:middle line:10%
For decades,
starting in the '50s,

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.750 align:middle line:10%
politicians,
university professors,

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.570 align:middle line:10%
and citizens of Italy
were contacted by beings

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:51.520 align:middle line:10%
from a different world.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.200 align:middle line:10%
The ETs were on
Earth on a mission

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:57.170 align:middle line:10%
to help humanity evolve to
their next spiritual level.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:59.080 align:middle line:10%
The many witnesses
and participants

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.760 align:middle line:10%
of the program filmed
flying craft, flew with ETs,

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.040 align:middle line:10%
and even learned their language.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.040 align:middle line:10%
Jaime has been following
the case for many years.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.170 align:middle line:84%
According to the
witness testimonies,

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.900 align:middle line:84%
other alien factions
that idolized science

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.670 align:middle line:84%
attempted, on
numerous occasions,

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:90%
to bring the project down.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.640 align:middle line:84%
The conflict led to a plethora
of paranormal phenomena

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.685 align:middle line:84%
in the Adriatic Sea and
over the Italian skies.

00:36:24.685 --> 00:36:26.903 align:middle line:90%


00:36:26.903 --> 00:36:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of that case?

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I covered that case.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Italy
from '92 to 2007,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.720 align:middle line:84%
when I returned to
the United States.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And Stefano Breccia that's
there gave me all the material.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed Gaspare
de Lama at Lake Como.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:44.650 align:middle line:90%
I have it on my YouTube channel.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And he and his wife were part
of the agreement, the Amicizia,

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:51.650 align:middle line:90%
which means friendship.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Amicizia.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.520 align:middle line:90%
And they were part of that.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And I went to Lake
Como to interview them.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I saw Paolo Di Girolamo
there, who has since died.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:00.640 align:middle line:90%
He lived in Rome.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.590 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed him.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And the only other researcher
other than Jaime Maussan--

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about him
earlier as a journalist--

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.930 align:middle line:90%
was Timothy Good.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:10%
Nobody else bothered
to go there to--

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:10%
and it's in Timothy Good's book,
"Earth and Alien Enterprise."

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.460 align:middle line:10%
But nobody bothers
with foreign cases.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.670 align:middle line:10%
And I knew Stefano
Breccia, so I was

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.940 align:middle line:10%
able to follow all of
those people there,

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.320 align:middle line:10%
talk to them personally.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Which shocked me
was this, George.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:36.190 align:middle line:90%
That was 1956.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:40.240 align:middle line:84%
In 1956, we had
human-type beings--

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.580 align:middle line:84%
aliens-- interacting with 10
Italians on the Adriatic Coast.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:50.380 align:middle line:84%
In 1985, we had
human-type beings

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.720 align:middle line:84%
interacting with people
off of the coast of Chile.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's the Chilean
friendship case in '85.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And I just came back
from there in September,

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and I interviewed the people
that were involved in that case

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:11.720 align:middle line:84%
to try to look at how similar
both cases were 20 years later.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they similar?

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:13.845 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Not really.

00:38:13.845 --> 00:38:16.240 align:middle line:84%
The ones in Chile
were scientists.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.130 align:middle line:90%
They were on an island.

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:19.710 align:middle line:90%
They were Germanic-looking.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:25.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they call themselves
Carl, and the woman was Greta,

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:29.170 align:middle line:84%
and they were blonde-haired,
blue-eyed people.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:32.410 align:middle line:84%
They said they were
extraterrestrial and interacted

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.860 align:middle line:90%
with Octavio Ortiz.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:84%
But the mystery
around that, you know,

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:42.850 align:middle line:84%
is that the Germans were also
in that area after World War II.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering what
the connection was.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Those beings were scientists.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.990 align:middle line:84%
They were on the
island of Chiloe.

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
interviewing Octavio Ortiz,

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.160 align:middle line:84%
he told me they protected
the Challenger disaster a day

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.090 align:middle line:90%
before it happened.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:01.265 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I'm going, how
could they know these things?

00:39:01.265 --> 00:39:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, NASA goes
down to check on this case.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
there are agencies

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that are taking these
cases seriously.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So I interviewed the Italian
friendship-- this friendship--

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.720 align:middle line:84%
basically because
my interest is in

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:21.667 align:middle line:84%
human-type extraterrestrials,
not just in abductions.

00:39:21.667 --> 00:39:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
that's one of the reasons

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm not working a lot here.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want it to be
an abduction-focused field.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:34.720 align:middle line:84%
We have ETs that look
like us walking among us.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had
contact yourself, Paola?

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I don't talk
about it very much.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Yes, with a Latin
American situation.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.690 align:middle line:84%
With Ricardo Gonzalez,
who has just done--

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --who has just done
some series here for Gaia.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.310 align:middle line:84%
He asked me-- invited me
to a forest in Shasta,

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:01.850 align:middle line:84%
where I saw standing before me
a 10 foot-tall spaceman dressed

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:02.650 align:middle line:90%
in a space outfit.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How close was he?

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:07.493 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I don't know
in feet wise, but like,

00:40:07.493 --> 00:40:08.410 align:middle line:90%
from here to the wall.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's maybe 500--

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared?

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, I had
PTSD for two years.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:17.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he
communicate with you?

00:40:17.112 --> 00:40:18.029 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, he did.

00:40:18.029 --> 00:40:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did he say?

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And there were
seven people present.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo wasn't there.

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:23.470 align:middle line:90%
He told me couldn't come.

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:26.710 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah, there were women.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the ET
know who you were?

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, he
asked me to come.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.820 align:middle line:90%
He asked me.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:33.620 align:middle line:90%
I was invited.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:34.995 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe
it and I thought

00:40:34.995 --> 00:40:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo was wanting publicity.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And the problem was that I don't
camp, and those people camp.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:41.850 align:middle line:90%
And they fast.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 10 foot?

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.490 align:middle line:90%
He was tall.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:45.630 align:middle line:90%
In fact, he was--

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I could see on the tree, he
was standing next to the tree,

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.260 align:middle line:90%
how tall he was.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't-- it was
not anything I ever saw,

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.090 align:middle line:90%
so I had trouble.

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I had trouble.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.730 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was going crazy.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:02.320 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's impossible.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.862 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
excited about this?

00:41:03.862 --> 00:41:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, I was scared.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You, the greatest
researcher of all time--

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I was scared.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --was scared?

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I was scared.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Because it wasn't anything--

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.920 align:middle line:84%
nobody prepares you
for these things.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So he's talking to me for
3 minutes in a language

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:18.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.100 align:middle line:90%
He sounds like an echo.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.270 align:middle line:84%
He sounds like I'm
hearing a bullhorn--

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:23.520 align:middle line:90%
somebody behind a bullhorn.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.700 align:middle line:84%
At the very end of three
minutes, he looks at me

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and he says, (MONOTONE)
"Thank you," like a robot.

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.530 align:middle line:10%
Turns around with
one fell swoop--

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:36.850 align:middle line:10%
he did it one fell swoop--

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:10%
and walked into the forest.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And disappeared.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.190 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And kept walking.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.355 align:middle line:10%
It was 11:00 at night, so--

00:41:44.355 --> 00:41:46.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You were going
to go walk after him?

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, no, no.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:47.455 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:47.455 --> 00:41:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: See, I would have.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, no, no.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was his name?

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Did he have a name?

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Antarel.

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Antarel comes from Apu,
that base in the mountain I

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.130 align:middle line:90%
was just talking about.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The extraterrestrial's
name was Antanel?

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.335 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Antarel.

00:42:01.335 --> 00:42:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Antarel.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And Ricardo, whom you've
recorded here at Gaia,

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.200 align:middle line:84%
will talk about his
contact with Antarel,

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and that he's had contact
with this human-type being.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And the base is in the
Ancash part of Peru.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.470 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I went there.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.220 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have contact
there or anything,

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.940 align:middle line:10%
but I wanted to see
where the base was.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And this being had invited
me as part of a-- there

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.180 align:middle line:90%
was seven of us.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.940 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And he had invited me to be
there, but I didn't believe it.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't-- it was
not in my reality.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.280 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
understand, when you're

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.805 align:middle line:84%
looking at something that is
not part of your reality--

00:42:45.805 --> 00:42:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.765 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

00:42:48.765 --> 00:42:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Did you think somebody was
playing a game with you?

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was real.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.520 align:middle line:84%
But then I had to
question everything.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.810 align:middle line:90%
It's like, is this reality?

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:00.735 align:middle line:90%
Did I hear this?

00:43:00.735 --> 00:43:01.535 align:middle line:90%
Am I going crazy?

00:43:01.535 --> 00:43:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought you
could handle anything--

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:05.278 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --with what
you've gone through.

00:43:05.278 --> 00:43:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, no.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.798 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:07.798 --> 00:43:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad
this happened to you?

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yes, because then
it made me look at the fact

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:20.160 align:middle line:84%
that we, as researchers,
don't know everything,

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and that those beings
out there know about us.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And the "thank you," Ricardo
said, was not for work--

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.840 align:middle line:90%
this happened in 2014--

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.040 align:middle line:90%
that I did in the past.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.530 align:middle line:84%
It was for what I was
going to do in the future.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.570 align:middle line:10%
Because they're time travelers.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.190 align:middle line:10%
This being is a time traveler.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:39.540 align:middle line:10%
He can see the future.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.590 align:middle line:84%
He's warned about
CERN in Switzerland.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.970 align:middle line:84%
He's warned about ecological
disaster on this planet,

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:51.640 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to do
ourselves in ecologically.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Because they've already seen
it happen on one timeline.

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm looking at the
messages that are still coming,

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:01.410 align:middle line:90%
but I never--

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:03.690 align:middle line:90%
what the story is, is that I--

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.580 align:middle line:84%
this happened at the
very end of three days.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.122 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't wait to
get out of there--

00:44:07.122 --> 00:44:07.922 align:middle line:90%
in Shasta.

00:44:07.922 --> 00:44:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Because I don't camp.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I was freezing.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.675 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't take it.

00:44:10.675 --> 00:44:12.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The weather
was tough for you.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Oh, a one-man tent,
and you're freezing to death,

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:16.710 align:middle line:10%
and there's no food?

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't wait to
get out of there.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:21.270 align:middle line:84%
It was at the very end
when the craft flew over.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And Ricardo over to me and
said, can you handle this?

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had a split
second to decide

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:29.400 align:middle line:90%
if I was going to go there.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I had to walk down
a hill without flashlight

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.650 align:middle line:84%
with these women that
didn't speak English.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:39.870 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going, OK, I'll
say yes, but I don't

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.340 align:middle line:10%
know what's going to happen.
