Mark, welcome to

>>MARK ANTHONY:
Thank you, George.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.550 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.508 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's new with
the trial lawyer who's

00:00:48.508 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:90%
a psychic at the same time?

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.010 align:middle line:10%
>>ANTHONY: I've got my
next book in the pipeline

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.855 align:middle line:10%
and got a number of projects.

00:00:53.855 --> 00:00:55.730 align:middle line:10%
And it's great being
here on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
next book called?

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Well, we have a
few different working titles.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So a publisher and I are going
back and forth on those right

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we get into it,
I want people to actually

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.380 align:middle line:84%
have a look at a video where
you explain exactly what you do.

Anthony, and I'm

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:90%
known as the psychic explorer.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I travel the paranormal,
mystical, and sacred sites

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:84%
It's overwhelming how
powerful this place is.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm also a trial attorney.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.495 align:middle line:10%
What could be scarier than a
lawyer who sees dead people?

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And I seek evidence to
explain the unknown.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:84%
My whole left side, I feel
like someone's breaking my arm.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:84%
As a psychic medium, I must
provide evidence transmitted

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:84%
to me by spirits to prove the
authenticity of the contact.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Whoo, now I'm getting
cold chills and tingles.

>>NOORY: How did
a psychic lawyer--

00:01:47.028 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: How did that happen?

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, how did
this happen for you?

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.308 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Well,
both of my parents

00:01:51.308 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:84%
have mediumistic
abilities, and it runs

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:90%
in the family for generations.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: And I was actually
very much considering

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:84%
a career in the clergy, which
is not unusual for people

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:90%
that are mediums.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:90%
We're drawn to the spiritual.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:10%
>>ANTHONY: But I felt that it
would be too confining, too

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:10%
many rules and
regulations, so I ended up

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.520 align:middle line:10%
going into law instead, not
that there's too many rules

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.585 align:middle line:10%
and regulations there.

00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Big difference.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Quite a bit.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your
parents encourage you

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:90%
to get into the psychic world?

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Actually, it
was such a fact of life--

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
when I was a child, they
wanted me to keep it quiet.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you can
talk about it to us,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:84%
but people outside of the
family won't understand.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they'll think
you're strange or something.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Yeah.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.130 align:middle line:90%
They think that you're strange.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And my father's
sister, Marjorie,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:84%
was an extremely
gifted psychic medium.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is her husband,
who was very religious,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.170 align:middle line:84%
felt that she was doing
the work of Satan.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen,
or what happened,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:84%
is she warned him about
going to work one day.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And he worked at a steel
plant in Pennsylvania.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't want him to go.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.898 align:middle line:84%
And he worked in this
machine shop there.

00:02:59.898 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, that day,
George, a crane was

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:84%
lifting thousands of
pounds of steel beams,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and the cable snapped, and it
flattened the machine shop,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:90%
killing everybody there.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:90%
So he would have been there.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And you think he would
have been grateful.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But instead, he felt that
she was doing evil work,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and he had her
involuntarily committed.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Yeah.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And they subjected her
to electroshock therapy

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:90%
for over four months.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.450 align:middle line:90%
That was cruel.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Yeah, until she
never saw spirits again.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.197 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
forced her to stop.

00:03:31.197 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: They
forced her to do this.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it was
looked at in those days.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So psychics and mediums have
been persecuted for centuries.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was a
little kid, my dad

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
didn't want that
happening to me.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, and it
probably would have.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: It could have.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's openly discussed.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are no
longer a trial lawyer.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:84%
You decided to devote
your entire career

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:90%
to the psychic realm.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
But when you were, did you
use these psychic abilities

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:90%
in any of your cases?

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: It's part of
my skill set and who I am,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:84%
so it certainly did
come up, particularly

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:84%
during jury selection, which is
the segment before we actually

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle line:84%
begin putting
witnesses on the stand.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.448 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Both the
prosecution, defense,

00:04:12.448 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
or the plaintiff
and the defense,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
get to ask the prospective
jurors questions

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
so we can narrow
down to make sure we

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:90%
have a fair and impartial jury.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.057 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it really
started becoming very useful.

00:04:24.057 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
does a psychic lawyer

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:90%
think about consciousness?

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Consciousness is the
energy of who and what we are.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.430 align:middle line:84%
In spiritual circles,
but in people of faith,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
it's called the
soul or the spirit.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is used by
philosophers, psychologists,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:90%
and scientists.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's the essence
of who we are--

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.450 align:middle line:84%
our personality, individuality,
our likes, dislikes,

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:90%
our observations.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:90%
And consciousness is eternal.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:90%
It's pure energy.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating,
George, about consciousness,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:84%
is that it is
capable of perception

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:84%
beyond our five physical senses
of sight, hearing, taste,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:90%
smell, and touch.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness is also
capable of perceiving

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
dimensions beyond our
physical material world.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why isn't science
dabbling with this?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: The interesting
thing is that neuroscience

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:90%
is the study of the brain.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And the official position
of neuroscience, George,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness
is created by chemical

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.600 align:middle line:84%
reactions and electrical
impulses within the brain.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:84%
But they're completely at
a loss how to explain why.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.970 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you read
a neuroscience book,

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
there will be 900
pages on functions

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and maybe
two or three paragraphs

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.630 align:middle line:90%
about consciousness.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And we have to instead
look at the brain

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.720 align:middle line:84%
as what it is-- a
carbon-12 and salt

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.790 align:middle line:90%
resonator floating in water.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a
computer hard drive.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And a hard drive on a computer
doesn't create the programs

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
on it or the data,
it merely hosts them.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's the
same with our brain.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:84%
It does not create
consciousness,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:90%
it merely hosts it.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness pre-exist the
brain, comes into the brain.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And when the hard
drive brain crashes--

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.460 align:middle line:90%
in other words, when we die--

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
it gets uploaded to
a higher frequency.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As long as we
keep getting uploaded,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.122 align:middle line:90%
that's all that matters.

00:06:15.122 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: As long as we
keep getting uploaded.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
quantum paradigm?

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Quantum, well, first
off, with quantum physics,

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:84%
people like to throw the
word around as a buzz phrase.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tough word too.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Yeah.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And we know from
science that everything

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
is made of molecules,
which are made

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:84%
of atoms, which are made
of electrons, protons,

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:90%
and neutrons.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:84%
But on the most basic,
level everything

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:84%
is composed of quanta, which
is pure electromagnetic energy.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So the most fundamental
building block of everything

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:84%
in existence-- and that's you,
me, the air we're breathing,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:84%
the light, our planet, the
nuclear reactions in the sun--

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: --everything
is electromagnetic energy.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And the quantum paradigm is that
we can leap from one dimension

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Instantly.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, George, we all
have days where we don't feel

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.330 align:middle line:84%
like we're all here, and
that's because we're not.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the
Schwarzschild quantum lattice

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:84%
theory-- back in the early 20th
century, Karl Schwarzschild,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:84%
good friend of Max Planck
and Albert Einstein--

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: He theorized that
electrons would disappear

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
from one location,
appear in another,

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:84%
without traversing
the matter in between.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Now this has been
recreated in laboratories.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So subatomic
particles are quantum

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
leaping to another
dimension all the time.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.388 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Well, it is.

00:07:40.388 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you take the energy
that's in our brain, our soul,

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:84%
particles of that-- because
it's electromagnetic energy--

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:84%
are quantum leaping to
this other dimension.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And now, George, we know
from quantum entanglement

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.400 align:middle line:84%
that when two subatomic
particles go apart,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:84%
they remain
connected, entangled.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And something that
happens to one

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
immediately happens
to the other,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:84%
even if, as scientists theorize,
they're a billion miles apart.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is dramatic.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:84%
On the "Mystery
Teachings" Gaia show,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.798 align:middle line:84%
physicist Dr. Theresa Bullard
talks about this paradigm.

00:08:15.798 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>THERESA BULLARD: Let's take
a look at these two paradigms--

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Newtonian versus quantum--
and how they differ.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
The Newtonian paradigm
is based upon the ideas

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:84%
of determinism, separatism,
reductionism, and materialism.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:10%
In essence, this
says that everything

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:10%
can be isolated and reduced
to its individual parts, which

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:10%
must function in a linear,
logical, clockwork way.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:10%
It says that things should be
predictable and controllable.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:10%
And it cuts us off
from spirit and choice.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And it encourages separation,
which fuels ego and greed.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to look far to
see how this old paradigm has

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:90%
led to a world out of balance.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:10%
What about the quantum paradigm?

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:10%
What is it?

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:10%
And can it help us
improve our situation?

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:84%
In a quantum view, things are
complementary, contextual,

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:90%
conscious, and connected.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:10%
These quantum principles
turn the Newtonian paradigm

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:10%
completely on its head.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Now while strange and
exotic, quantum theory

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
is the most successful physics
theory we have to date.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:10%
We live in a quantum
universe, from the smallest

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:10%
of particles to the
largest structures

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.620 align:middle line:10%
of intergalactic space.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:10%
Quantum principles underlie
everything in our universe.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:90%
We, too, are quantum beings.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the most exciting
and promising aspects

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics
is that it says

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
is participatory,

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:90%
meaning our choices matter.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Even our thoughts matter.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, break
down what she just said.

00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Well,
first, we have to look

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:90%
at Newtonian reductionism.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Sir Isaac Newton, he's
one of the superstars

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.610 align:middle line:90%
of the Enlightenment.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Brilliant guy.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.338 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way before his time.

00:10:12.338 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Way before his time.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, during the
Great Plague of 1665,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.450 align:middle line:84%
he self-quarantined, and he
put his time to good use.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:84%
He invented calculus,
the laws of optics,

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:90%
and the laws of motion.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By self-quarantine.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: By self-quarantine.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.578 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I should learn that.

00:10:28.578 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: But he felt
that everything could just

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:84%
be reduced to a miniaturized
version of itself.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:84%
But you can't blame
Sir Isaac for that,

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't have the
benefit of 21st century

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:84%
technology, which could take us
to the subatomic level, which

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle line:90%
is now quanta.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm pretty
certain that if Newton

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:84%
had the technology
of today and was

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.940 align:middle line:84%
able to make the discovery
that everything on the most

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:84%
basic level is
electromagnetic energy,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:84%
then he would have
agreed with this.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
is interconnected.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
was discussing about

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:84%
with quantum entanglement,
that you, me, everything

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.630 align:middle line:84%
is connected through
electromagnetic energy.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
Albert Einstein was talking

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:90%
about, that there is no matter.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.620 align:middle line:84%
There's only energy
which vibrates

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
at different
frequencies so as to be

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:90%
perceptible to the senses.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So when we hear from all
the great spiritual teachers

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:84%
about how we're all brothers
and sisters, how we're all

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.880 align:middle line:84%
interconnected, they
were absolutely right,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.735 align:middle line:84%
because we are on that
basic electromagnetic level.

00:11:38.735 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
fascinating work.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Now when you deal
with this ability,

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
how does that enhance
your psychic abilities?

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: With disability?

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.392 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your psychic abilities.

00:11:50.392 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Oh, when I work
with my psychic abilities.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.947 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have no
disabilities, do you?

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: You know, we all
have disabilities somewhere.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I can talk to dead
people, but don't

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.510 align:middle line:84%
ask me to change the
water pump in your car.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: OK.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Got that right.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: This completely
ties into psychic abilities.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I refer to our soul as
the electromagnetic soul,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.320 align:middle line:84%
because that's a 21st
century term to describe who

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:90%
and what we really are--

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: --which is
pure consciousness that is

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:90%
eternal electromagnetic energy.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And so when I open up my
brain to higher frequencies,

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:32.220 align:middle line:84%
think of our world as AM radio,
the other side as FM radio.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm bringing up my
brainwave frequency out of AM,

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
spirits are lowering
their frequency from FM,

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:90%
we get a frequency match.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Once again, we're
interconnected.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:84%
It's merely an alignment
of frequencies,

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's all based
on quantum physics.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Biophotons,
what are they?

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.625 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Biophotons
are fascinating.

00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever dropped
something on your foot,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:84%
like a bowling ball,
and immediately, you

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:90%
know that it hurts?

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It hurts.

00:12:59.525 --> 00:13:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: And it hits our
brain, and it's so fast.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stub your little toe.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Absolutely.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
it's not chemical

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:84%
because that would
take too long.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And our nervous system
uses electricity,

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.670 align:middle line:84%
so it's moving at
the speed of light.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, biophotons are ultra
weak photon emissions

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.480 align:middle line:90%
within our individual cells.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And they were first
discovered back in 1923

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:84%
by Alexander
Gurwitsch in Russia.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And now we know that our
cells emit flashes of light,

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and they communicate
with each other.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in 2012, "MIT
Technology Review"

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.860 align:middle line:84%
issued a report
indicating that biophotons

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.920 align:middle line:84%
are the basis of
cellular communications.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing because
Albert Einstein once

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.780 align:middle line:84%
said that we are
all beings of light.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:10%
Well, he was correct,
because now we

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:middle line:10%
know, on a cellular level, that
we communicate through flashes

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.310 align:middle line:10%
of light, and therefore,
our body is, in essence,

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:10%
a matrix of light.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they know we
had biophotons in the 1920s?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:90%
How did they know this?

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Well,
Alexander Gurwitsch

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:90%
was way ahead of his time.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And he started looking at these
through intense microscopes.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And now, with the
electron microscope,

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:84%
which any
self-respecting lab has--

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or did we
have it in 1920?

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: I don't believe
that they had this then.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: And so it was
looked at as junk science,

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.695 align:middle line:84%
pseudoscience, and
it was a theory.

00:14:31.695 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: But Gurwitsch
stuck to his guns.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:84%
But now we do know
that this exists.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, George, it's
different than bioluminescence,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:90%
like a firefly.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Firefly, and there are certain
types of fish, they glow.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Biophotons are ultra
weak photon emissions,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
which are invisible to the
naked eye, but they still exist.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And they form the basis
of cellular communication,

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
not just in humans and
animals, but also in plants.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the last
few years, scientists

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:84%
have found out that it
appears that plants,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:84%
particularly trees, even
of different species,

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
seem to be communicating when
their roots systems touch

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
each other, and it all
comes back to biophotons.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we die, we
leave our physical bodies.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Yes.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what happens
when we die, in your opinion?

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Energetically, what
happens is the electromagnetic

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:90%
soul--

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:84%
the who and what we are
enshrined in our body--

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:36.370 align:middle line:84%
transfers from, quantum
leaps from the material world

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Now the other side,
which I also refer to as

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:90%
the collective consciousness--

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: --is think of
your soul as a drop of water.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So when you die, that drop
of water leaves your brain

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and plunges into the
eternal sea of souls.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I call it the collective
consciousness because the EMS--

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.032 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
soul-- is connected

00:15:58.032 --> 00:15:59.740 align:middle line:84%
to other souls,
connected to other souls,

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:90%
connected to other souls.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's this infinite
vast database.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.820 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard the
euphemistic saying,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:84%
we're all cells in
the body of God.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is what that is.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when we die, we
quantum leap from this world

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:84%
into the collective
consciousness.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:10%
And that's why, when
communicating with spirits,

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:10%
many times, a spirit will come
through and provide information

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.110 align:middle line:10%
that far exceeded anything that
he or she knew in this world.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:84%
That's because they're patched
into this cosmic internet.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, you've heard
of the mentalist Uri Geller.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, he talks a little
bit about the energy

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.460 align:middle line:90%
within the human body.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's watch.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>URI GELLER: Albert Einstein,
1924, spoken about this,

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.595 align:middle line:84%
comes up with this amazing
scientific equation--

00:16:49.595 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:90%
e equals MC squared--

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:84%
where Albert Einstein proves
to the world scientifically

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
made from energy.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Even this chair is energy.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
It's vibrating certain frequency
that to us feels solid.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:84%
But he also proves that
energy cannot be destroyed.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So if Albert Einstein proved
scientifically that energy

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.660 align:middle line:84%
cannot be destroyed, the
question must be asked, OK,

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:84%
we're energy, so what
happens when we die?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.810 align:middle line:90%
So you can't kill the energy.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.400 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our spirit?

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our soul?

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.380 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our mind energy?

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And I very simply
believe that when

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
we die, our energy,
our spirit, our soul,

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:84%
leaves our body, like
the tens of thousands

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.290 align:middle line:84%
of stories you have
from millions of people

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
around the world, that
they left their body,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
they weren't ready to die, and
they came back to the body.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.380 align:middle line:84%
They went through the tunnel
of light, and the music,

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and there were
just about to enter

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
that other side, the realm,
heaven, paradise, call

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:84%
it whatever, and they were
drawn back into their body.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:84%
There are millions of stories
of spirits communicating

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.260 align:middle line:84%
with their loved ones--
dogs, cats, animals, humans,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.580 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, come on.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:22.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a fact that people
accept that ghosts do exist.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.433 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would assume
you would agree with Uri.

00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: I don't find anything
that I disagree with him.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:90%
He was right on point.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now with the energy
that exists after we die,

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:90%
where does it go?

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Well, that's the
collective consciousness.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's a dimension
that's parallel to ours.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:84%
According to string theory,
there's more than one universe.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And within universes, there
are several dimensions.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I like to use
the analogy of AM and FM radio.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:84%
They're two systems that
coincide side by side.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.817 align:middle line:84%
They are both based on
energy and frequency.

00:18:56.817 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I happen to
be on both, by the way.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: I know that.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And so let's say you're
listening to "Coast to Coast

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.413 align:middle line:84%
AM," but it's broadcast on an
FM station in certain markets.

00:19:09.413 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That happens.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: So, see?

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:90%
The frequencies overlap.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly it, is that
Albert Einstein was correct,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.920 align:middle line:84%
as Uri Geller said,
that there is no matter.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
There's just energy
which vibrates

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:90%
at different frequencies.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And also, Uri was
quoting, I believe

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.660 align:middle line:84%
it's the second law
of thermodynamics,

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.420 align:middle line:84%
that energy can neither
be created nor destroyed,

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.880 align:middle line:84%
only transferred from
one form to another.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's correct.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.970 align:middle line:90%
And it moves on.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:10%
Now what are the ghosts?

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.320 align:middle line:84%
When he mentioned ghosts,
we all believe in ghosts--

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:90%
what's happening with that?

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:90%
This is energy coming back?

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.748 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:19:46.748 --> 00:19:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Well, there's
three schools of thought

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:90%
on what a ghost is.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:84%
One is that it's a
spirit that immediately

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:84%
transfers to the
other side, and that's

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.950 align:middle line:90%
the school I subscribe to.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Then there are people who
feel that ghosts are somehow

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:90%
trapped here, ergo hauntings.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
subscribe to that theory.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And the third is
that a place that

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:84%
is haunted or very strong
with the force, if you will,

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:84%
is actually a
residual energy echo.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.140 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you
go to a place that's--

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:84%
well, from my own
experience, when I went

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:90%
to Dachau Concentration Camp.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
When I was 19, I was
visiting Germany,

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and I was with a bunch
of college friends,

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:90%
and we're a bit hung over.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: And I wasn't
prepared for what happened.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.487 align:middle line:84%
And when I walked into the
concentration camp, all

00:20:40.487 --> 00:20:42.070 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, I found
myself surrounded

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.270 align:middle line:90%
by all these shrieking spirits.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could feel it.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.243 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: And I could
see the striped garb.

00:20:46.243 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, I collapsed on
my knees, and I was shaking.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of my friends,
he was from my hometown,

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and he kind of knew
about my family and all

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that, and he goes,
all right, buddy,

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.293 align:middle line:90%
we're getting out of here.

00:20:56.293 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And he just pulled me
up and got me on a bus.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.210 align:middle line:84%
He goes, look, dude, I
don't know what happened,

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:90%
but something happened.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that those
spirits are trapped there.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.690 align:middle line:10%
But when something intensely
traumatic happens in an area,

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:10%
it creates an energy echo.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's no more
a sentient spirit

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
than your reflection
in a mirror is you.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people that
do clearings, or exorcisms,

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.130 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, of a
particular place,

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.500 align:middle line:84%
they're essentially
breaking that echo,

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.450 align:middle line:90%
deflecting the energy off.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Because based on the thousands
of readings I've done--

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:84%
George, at this
point in my life,

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I've done readings for
over 15,000 people.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And in each reading,
particularly the one-on-ones,

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%
at least six to seven
spirits per person

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.623 align:middle line:84%
comes through, oftentimes,
more than that.

00:21:44.623 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Yeah, so maybe
100,000, 200,000 spirits

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:90%
I've communicated with.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:84%
They know full well, the second
they are done with this body,

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:84%
they revert to a purely
energetic eternal state,

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.450 align:middle line:90%
and they're aware of it.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why I don't believe
ghosts are trapped here.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
electromagnetic soul, the EMS?

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Yes, the EMS.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:90%
We are eternal consciousness.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at all the great
spiritual teachers from Krishna

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:21.720 align:middle line:84%
through Moses, Buddha,
Jesus, Muhammad, Yogananda

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Paramahansa, Saint
Francis of Assisi,

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:28.410 align:middle line:84%
the Native American teachers,
all the great belief systems

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:90%
teach us that the soul--

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.660 align:middle line:84%
who and what we are-- pre-exist
the body, comes into the body,

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.630 align:middle line:90%
moves on after the body dies.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And like we were
just discussing,

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.770 align:middle line:84%
energy is neither
created nor destroyed,

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.900 align:middle line:84%
only transferred from
one form to another.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So based on my research,
I developed the term

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic soul to
describe who and what we really

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.800 align:middle line:84%
are, which is pure
consciousness, which is

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.788 align:middle line:90%
eternal electromagnetic energy.

00:22:57.788 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's all energy.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Ergo the
electromagnetic soul.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
terminal lucidity.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.320 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Terminal
lucidity occurs in about 10%

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.340 align:middle line:84%
of the cases, where somebody is
completely nonresponsive prior

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.240 align:middle line:84%
to death, could be due to
brain damage, Alzheimer's,

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.190 align:middle line:90%
meningitis strokes.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:84%
They are not responsive at
all, and their condition

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:90%
is terminal.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And then right before
they die, George,

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.120 align:middle line:84%
usually in the last few
minutes, they wake up,

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and they recognize
people around them.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And things
and stuff like that.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:32.787 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: And things.

00:23:32.787 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're completely
lucid and coherent.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And this term,
terminal lucidity,

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:84%
was developed by Michael Nahm,
who's a German neurobiologist.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have always thought
about the deathbed discussion

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:90%
of Steven Jobs, Apple Computer.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:10%
And his last words were
like, oh, wow, oh, wow.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Yes.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, wow.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Sam Kinison, the comedian
who died in a tragic car

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:07.810 align:middle line:84%
crash going back between LA and
Vegas, was petrified of dying

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and didn't want to die.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.230 align:middle line:84%
But right at the
moment of death,

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:84%
in front of eyewitnesses, he
went, oh, OK, OK, and died.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: That's known
as a deathbed vision.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And a deathbed vision is when
somebody who is actively dying,

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
their frequency aligns

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:84%
with the frequency
of the other side,

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to
perceive spirits.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's real, isn't it?

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.577 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: It is real.

00:24:36.577 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:84%
The scientists who
study this, George,

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:84%
they are convinced that
it's not a hallucination.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.240 align:middle line:84%
I, myself, have observed this
on a number of occasions.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Because in my
capacity as a medium,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm often called to the bedside
of people who are dying.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:90%
And I can assure you it is real.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.928 align:middle line:84%
They are actually
seeing the spirits

00:24:53.928 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:90%
who are coming to welcome them.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not a
hallucination by any means.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.802 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: It is
not a hallucination.

00:24:58.802 --> 00:25:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Near-death
experiences--

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:90%
we have heard lots of them.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Yes, we have.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eben
Alexander, the things

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.830 align:middle line:90%
that Raymond Moody talks about.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.068 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on those?

00:25:08.068 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Near-death
experiences are real.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I had one when I
was four years old.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: I did.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a fairly lengthy
story, so I'll

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:16.610 align:middle line:90%
give you the condensed version.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me
the Cliff version.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: The CliffNotes.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I had a real bad blood
infection from impetigo, called

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:84%
septicemia, and I went into
cardiopulmonary failure.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: And my
mother was frantic.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And she ran outside and started
screaming, my baby's dying.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And our neighbor just
happened to be a fireman,

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and he runs across the
street, starts doing--

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He pumped you.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.075 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Yeah, he
starts doing compressions

00:25:41.075 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
just as an ambulance pulls
up, because my sister called

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.560 align:middle line:90%
an ambulance.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:84%
On the way to the hospital,
they slammed the door,

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and the ventilator hose
got caught in the door,

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:56.100 align:middle line:84%
so then I stopped breathing,
and I went into cardiac arrest.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And so my mother was in
the ambulance with them,

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and they said, we've
got to get this open.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I'll do it.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So the paramedic's holding
onto the gurney that I'm on.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:07.688 align:middle line:84%
He's holding onto
my mom's waistband.

00:26:07.688 --> 00:26:09.980 align:middle line:84%
She pries the door of the
ambulance open, gets her foot

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:90%
and yanks it in.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gets the--

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: And meanwhile,
I get catapulted out

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:90%
of the ambulance.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing it going
down the highway.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I go
into this bright white light,

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:90%
and there's these people there.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, George,
the looked translucent,

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.450 align:middle line:90%
like a clear version of people.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And they glowed
from the inside out.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:90%
And they were really nice to me.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.390 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't afraid of them.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, you're
going to be OK, Mark.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be OK.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard and saw
an even brighter light.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the words,
"eternal light, eternal life."

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Then I hear, "clear," and
I'm back in the ambulance

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.383 align:middle line:84%
because they hit me
with defibrillator pads,

00:26:57.383 --> 00:26:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and they shocked me, I
guess, out of the other side.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jarring
feeling, isn't it?

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: It was.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And later in the hospital,
they were hitting me

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.520 align:middle line:90%
with heavy duty IV antibiotics.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And when I came out of
it, I remember asking

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.238 align:middle line:90%
my parents, what is eternal?

00:27:12.238 --> 00:27:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And I remember mom and
dad looking at each other.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I didn't
realize, at that point,

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.460 align:middle line:84%
my dad, years
before, had not one

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.457 align:middle line:90%
but two near-death experiences.

00:27:21.457 --> 00:27:22.790 align:middle line:90%
And then when I was a teenager--

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.457 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they knew
what was going on.

00:27:24.457 --> 00:27:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Yeah, this has
been part of my family.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is in an
NDE, a near-death experience,

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.580 align:middle line:84%
your electromagnetic
soul leaves your body,

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and it touches that higher
frequency of the other side.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: And
you will encounter

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.090 align:middle line:84%
deceased loved ones,
the divine power,

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:47.510 align:middle line:84%
dare I say the word "God,"
and then you return.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And since the dawn
of recorded history,

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.910 align:middle line:84%
there have been accounts
of these resurrections,

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:57.050 align:middle line:84%
where people who died and then
came back to tell about it.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Hippocrates in Ancient
Greece wrote about this.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Plutarch in Ancient
Rome recorded these.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
real experiences.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Raymond Moody,
who we just mentioned,

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:11.777 align:middle line:84%
of course, talks about
shared death experiences.

00:28:11.777 --> 00:28:13.610 align:middle line:10%
>>RAYMOND MOODY: Very
commonly, at the scene

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:10%
where somebody is dying, and
the family members are assembled

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:10%
around the bed, as the person
in the bed passes away,

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.700 align:middle line:10%
the bystanders themselves
have experiences

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.190 align:middle line:10%
that are identical
to those that are

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:10%
reported to us by people
who are resuscitated

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.070 align:middle line:10%
after almost dying.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.250 align:middle line:10%
For example, the
bystander may say

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:10%
that as the person
in the bed dies,

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.950 align:middle line:10%
they see something
leave the body.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.220 align:middle line:10%
And this is very often
described as a light,

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.550 align:middle line:10%
like a globular,
grayish, golden light.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:53.420 align:middle line:10%
I hear this very often from
physicians, for example.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:10%
Then other people
at the bedside may

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:01.110 align:middle line:10%
say that as the individual
in the bed dies,

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.990 align:middle line:10%
the bystander themselves
say that they leave

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:06.330 align:middle line:10%
their physical
bodies, and they feel

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:10%
that they go part way
with their dying loved

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:10%
one toward this light.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.300 align:middle line:10%
And then at a
certain point, they

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.890 align:middle line:10%
come back and rejoin their body,
and their loved one goes on.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Or people may say that
as the person dies,

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:84%
the light fills the room, like
this amazing, bright light.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.970 align:middle line:10%
Or people will say that
they see apparitions

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:10%
of the dying person's
dead relatives and friends

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:38.910 align:middle line:10%
come into the room as though to
escort the dying person away.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:10%
And another very
common thing I hear

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:45.870 align:middle line:10%
is that the geometry of
the room shifts in some way

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:48.980 align:middle line:10%
that they find
impossible to describe.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:10%
I hear people say, for
example, that they suddenly

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:10%
realized that they were looking
at something in the room

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:10%
from an impossible angle,
or that they couldn't

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.610 align:middle line:10%
see the geometrical
markers in the room,

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.010 align:middle line:10%
like the walls and such.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He is so
efficient when it

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.600 align:middle line:84%
comes to near-death
experiences, isn't he?

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Oh, Raymond
Moody, he's a great guy.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.518 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's the best.

00:30:12.518 --> 00:30:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: He's awesome.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he makes it
so understandable too.

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Absolutely, he does.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I've witnessed shared death
experiences a number of times.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the
electromagnetic soul

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.690 align:middle line:84%
is in the process of
transferring from this side

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And with this frequency
alignment, bystanders,

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.820 align:middle line:84%
which can be close friends
and family, but also

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.400 align:middle line:84%
hospice workers,
health care providers,

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:84%
they start getting
caught up, and they

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:48.280 align:middle line:84%
begin to observe what the
dying person is experiencing.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
spirit contacts?

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:51.810 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Spirit
contacts all involve

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.560 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic
soul, but they're

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.160 align:middle line:84%
all different forms of
interdimensional communication.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Where we are raising
the vibrational frequency

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:08.400 align:middle line:84%
of our brain to align with the
frequency of the other side.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And spirit contacts can
be where you have a dream,

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and a deceased loved
one comes through.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.108 align:middle line:84%
And that's because when
you go from the beta state,

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:18.150 align:middle line:90%
that we're in right now--

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: And there's
four different types

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:21.213 align:middle line:90%
of brain wave frequencies.

00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:23.940 align:middle line:84%
You go from beta,
to alpha, to theta,

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and then delta is
much, much lower.

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But on the alpha-theta border,
your brain wave frequency

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:84%
is conducive to the alignment
with the other side.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
most popular form

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:84%
of interdimensional
communication

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.460 align:middle line:90%
is in the dream state.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know it,
because it feels real.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.680 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, people like
me can voluntarily do this,

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:84%
and scientists still
haven't figured that out.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But also, when people
encounter places

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.020 align:middle line:84%
that are very mystical
and spiritual.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps, all of a
sudden, you do see, or feel,

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.610 align:middle line:84%
or hear the spirit of
a deceased loved one.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:02.520 align:middle line:84%
We're all capable of
these experiences.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.020 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
everyone's a medium.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But everyone is capable of
having mediumistic experience.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are there different
ways of spirit contact,

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:90%
different forms?

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Oh, absolutely.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.830 align:middle line:90%
There's through a medium.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:84%
There is when a spirit
connects with you directly.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Those are all what I
call frequency beacons.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.397 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:32:20.397 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Once again, we're all
energetically interconnected.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And think of everyone that
you know, both on this side

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and on the other
side, being part

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.560 align:middle line:84%
of a three-dimensional
spiderweb.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
grieving somebody, you

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.610 align:middle line:84%
send a vibration
along that tether.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Spirit picks up on it, and the
spirit will be drawn to you.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, you
may be driving down

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.780 align:middle line:84%
the road, and all
of a sudden, you're

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.290 align:middle line:84%
compelled to turn on the
radio, and on a commercial,

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:47.940 align:middle line:84%
during "Coast to
Coast AM," they're

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:52.413 align:middle line:84%
playing this song that makes you
think of that person you love.

00:32:52.413 --> 00:32:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.130 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:55.307 align:middle line:90%
That happens all the time.

00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Happens to all of us.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would
this be considered

00:32:58.015 --> 00:32:59.730 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional communication?

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Absolutely.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.900 align:middle line:84%
These are all forms of
interdimensional communication.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.390 align:middle line:84%
People tend to think of the
collective consciousness,

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:11.880 align:middle line:84%
the other side, as being some
distant, nebulous destination,

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.150 align:middle line:84%
when actually, vibrationally
and energetically, it

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:17.610 align:middle line:90%
runs parallel to our universe.

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Very similar to what
Dr. Randy Veitenheimer talks

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.640 align:middle line:84%
about on the Gaia
program, "Undisclosed."

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
As we expand on out,

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:84%
they can enter into
areas that are populated,

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.100 align:middle line:90%
is what I refer to it.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:38.820 align:middle line:10%
So that each of the
dimensional categories

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:45.180 align:middle line:10%
can have their own rules, their
own laws, their own existences,

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:50.490 align:middle line:10%
their own populations, their
own deities, their own humans,

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:10%
if that's what you want to
use, or their own animals,

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:10%
the whole thing.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, this has been
referred to through mythology,

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.920 align:middle line:84%
through Native
American teachings,

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and that is an awareness of the
extension of reality into areas

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:13.260 align:middle line:84%
that we may not have
scientific method to validate.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And I love that
because they may not

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:20.219 align:middle line:84%
be able to be validated
scientifically,

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.679 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't mean
they don't exist.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.457 align:middle line:10%
>> It might be from
another dimension,

00:34:24.457 --> 00:34:26.790 align:middle line:10%
the eighth dimension, or
whatever number you want to put

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:27.590 align:middle line:10%
on it.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.840 align:middle line:10%
But once it comes
here, it has to fall

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.480 align:middle line:10%
under the three-dimensional
laws and rules of our dimension.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.287 align:middle line:84%
So it has to take that
form, wouldn't you say?

00:34:37.287 --> 00:34:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
it would have

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
to take on the laws
of our perception.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So we're not receptive
to ultraviolet

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and a few other extensions
of the electromagnetic field,

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.090 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't mean there's
not existence there.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you see things
you can't explain,

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:03.840 align:middle line:84%
the idea is that somehow you
have either traversed outward,

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.230 align:middle line:84%
or they have traversed inward,
to the point that there

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.090 align:middle line:90%
is a point of contact.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And mythology-wise, they used
to call it the veil is lifted.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.350 align:middle line:84%
There's just all
these references

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.990 align:middle line:84%
about where people
have knowledge

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:22.710 align:middle line:84%
of things that don't have
physical existence as we

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:23.520 align:middle line:90%
know it.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.060 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean that they don't
exist with some physicality,

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.330 align:middle line:10%
because all consciousness,
once it manifests,

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:34.500 align:middle line:10%
has some physicality to it,
even if it's just photonic,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.990 align:middle line:10%
even if it's just an electron.

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:37.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:37.205 --> 00:35:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
So we don't

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.395 align:middle line:84%
think about electrons
or subatomic particles

00:35:43.395 --> 00:35:47.160 align:middle line:84%
as having consciousness, but
if they have a reality to them,

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.900 align:middle line:84%
they have consciousness,
or consciousness

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.460 align:middle line:90%
exists within them.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So now, the same thing if
we were going to venture out

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:84%
in the universe,
is why wouldn't we

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:02.670 align:middle line:84%
expect to see things that
are physical in nature,

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time, why
would we be blind to the fact

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that it's much more
than we can perceive

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.050 align:middle line:84%
with our current
level of receptors

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.590 align:middle line:84%
that our physical
bodies are capable of?

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm amazed, Mark, how
many truly magnificent experts

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
there are out there in
these fields, like him.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Well, the
truth is the truth.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:10%
And there's such an
overlap because those of us

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.700 align:middle line:10%
who study the other
side and the afterlife,

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.510 align:middle line:10%
we begin to see that it all
comes down to quantum physics.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've never felt
that faith and science

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.160 align:middle line:90%
are mutually exclusive.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:84%
To me, the ultimate
objective of science

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:90%
is the discovery of God.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
who don't believe--

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.680 align:middle line:84%
they don't believe in
near-death experiences,

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.050 align:middle line:84%
they don't believe in
mediums, they don't believe

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:54.580 align:middle line:90%
in the psychic realm--

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.810 align:middle line:90%
do you try to reach them?

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:57.160 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to them?

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: It's funny,
because I've done readings

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.770 align:middle line:84%
for people who didn't
believe, and when they left,

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:04.030 align:middle line:90%
they definitely believe.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.640 align:middle line:90%


00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.490 align:middle line:90%
A funny story.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a reading
for this lady,

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and she brought
a friend of hers.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And her friend sat there the
whole time, all bottled up.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And I call that the
no, no, no syndrome.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: It's where
you reject everything.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's like deflector
shield technology, which

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Boeing has actually patented.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:26.680 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer just for
"Star Wars" or "Star Trek."

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Yeah.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Both the US, UK militaries are
developing deflector shields

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:84%
to protect tanks and
military equipment.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.810 align:middle line:84%
NASA, the European
Space Agency, and others

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:41.890 align:middle line:84%
are working on developing
electromagnetic barriers

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:45.775 align:middle line:84%
around spacecraft to deflect
debris and harmful radiation.

00:37:45.775 --> 00:37:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's smart.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: Yeah, because
radiation is another form

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.400 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic energy.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.695 align:middle line:84%
So if you go into
spirit communication

00:37:54.695 --> 00:37:57.070 align:middle line:84%
with "I don't believe, I don't
believe," or "no, no, no,"

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:84%
or you're so overcome with
grief, without meaning to,

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.310 align:middle line:84%
you're raising a
deflector shield.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to do
is bring those down.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing a
reading for this woman.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, it was at
the very end of the reading,

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and I said, your
father's here, and he's

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:16.030 align:middle line:84%
imitating Woody Woodpecker,
and he's going, guess who?

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.505 align:middle line:90%
Doo doo doo doo doo, like that.

00:38:17.505 --> 00:38:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY:
[WOODY WOODPECKER LAUGH]

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.673 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Exactly.

00:38:20.673 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So the woman I'm
doing the reading

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.347 align:middle line:84%
for goes, that doesn't make
any sense to me at all.

00:38:24.347 --> 00:38:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, the lady sitting next
to her who's all bottled up,

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.150 align:middle line:90%
tears shoot out of her eyes.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:29.245 align:middle line:90%
She goes, oh my god.

00:38:29.245 --> 00:38:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was her father.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.578 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: It was her father.

00:38:31.578 --> 00:38:33.845 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little
girl, he tucked me in,

00:38:33.845 --> 00:38:36.220 align:middle line:84%
closed the door, then he'd
always open and go, guess who?

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.044 align:middle line:90%
Doo doo doo doo doo.

00:38:38.044 --> 00:38:40.840 align:middle line:84%
She sent me more clients
than you can imagine.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She was a believer.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:42.987 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Absolutely.

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Because she had the experience
without expecting it.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And how could I possibly
make something like that up?

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do a lot of people
reject this belief system?

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: There's always going
to be people who reject things.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.530 align:middle line:10%
And they call what we're
delving into here junk

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.570 align:middle line:10%
science or pseudoscience.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But what we have to
remember, George,

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:09.520 align:middle line:84%
is that the science
fiction of today

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:84%
often becomes the scientific
reality of tomorrow.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:16.750 align:middle line:84%
In 1926, Nikola Tesla
gave an interview.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, one day, the entire
world will be a gigantic brain,

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be able to
see and hear each other,

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and communicate with each other
on a device small enough to fit

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.967 align:middle line:90%
in a man's breast pocket.

00:39:31.967 --> 00:39:33.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was a genius,
no question about it.

00:39:33.925 --> 00:39:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: He was a genius.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And you know, what's
so funny about that

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.200 align:middle line:84%
is scientists of the day
called it junk science.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.670 align:middle line:90%
They made fun of him.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:47.200 align:middle line:84%
But today, a cell phone
is a reality of our life.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And I like something that
astrophysicist Neil deGrasse

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Tyson said.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.740 align:middle line:84%
"The beauty of
science is that you

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:56.740 align:middle line:84%
don't have to believe
it for it to be true."

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:01.210 align:middle line:84%
What message would you like to
impart on the world right now?

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY: If I had
any message for people,

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:09.760 align:middle line:84%
it's that the divine power
that we call God exists,

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.350 align:middle line:90%
the afterlife exists.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:15.130 align:middle line:10%
Our soul, our
electromagnetic soul,

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.550 align:middle line:10%
is an immortal living being
that we can communicate

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.500 align:middle line:10%
with the electromagnetic soul.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:24.850 align:middle line:10%
And that we will be
reunited with our loved ones

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:28.720 align:middle line:10%
when it is our appointed
time to enter the light.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do our
viewers find Mark Anthony?

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.520 align:middle line:10%
>>ANTHONY:
evidenceofeternity.com,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.030 align:middle line:10%
same as my book,
"Evidence of Eternity."

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.615 align:middle line:10%
It's the same as my website--
evidenceofeternity.com.

00:40:39.615 --> 00:40:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ANTHONY: Thank you, George.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.210 align:middle line:90%
A pleasure.

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:43.840 align:middle line:90%
God bless.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've known
Mark Antony for years.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.137 align:middle line:10%
He's been on "Coast
to Coast," the radio

00:40:47.137 --> 00:40:48.610 align:middle line:10%
show with me, for years.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:51.830 align:middle line:10%
And folks who call
in just love him.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:54.760 align:middle line:84%
He's a psychic lawyer,
but he's the real deal.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm Georgia Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:05.000 align:middle line:90%
