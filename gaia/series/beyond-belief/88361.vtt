00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.281 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:11.586 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.549 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:10%
This is going to be perhaps one
of the most important programs

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:10%
you have ever
witnessed, because this

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:10%
has to do with your
livelihood and the livelihood

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.210 align:middle line:10%
of your family.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:10%
With us today is Michael Maloof.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:10%
He is the author of
"A Nation Forsaken."

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:10%
This is probably one of the
most important books I have read

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:10%
that has to do with our power
grid and the possibilities

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.480 align:middle line:10%
of it going down
because of two things:

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:10%
an EMP attack, an
Electromagnetic Pulse

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:10%
attack from a country
that detonates

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:10%
a nuke in the atmosphere, or
a major X flare from the sun.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you say
that can't happen,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:90%
it's already happened before.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:10%
We were just lucky
in the 1800s not

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:10%
to have had a lot of
power or electricity.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.740 align:middle line:10%
We did have the telegraph,
and that went out.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.479 align:middle line:90%
With us, Michael Maloof.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Michael, thanks for joining us.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL MALOOF:
Thanks for having me.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.331 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
I have undertaken,

00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
with your help and
wnd.com, a national effort

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
to get our grid protected
from an EMP or an X flare.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.010 align:middle line:90%
I think it's critical.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:84%
After I read your book
and Bill Forstchen's book,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
"One Second After," I said,
we've got to do something.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Rather than just go on the air
and do my shows about Bigfoot

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and UFOs, I've gotta devote
some time to this vast subject,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
with this huge audience, to get
people to understand that this

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
may be the biggest crisis
we will one day face.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, you
were there to help us.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
thank you for that.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: My pleasure.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for having me,
first of all, but you're

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:90%
absolutely right.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:10%
This is probably-- an
electromagnetic pulse event

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:10%
is perhaps our greatest
national security threat today.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain
what that is, an EMP.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:10%
>>MALOOF: An EMP is-- an
electromagnetic pulse--

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:10%
is high intensity particles
which can flare off and come

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:10%
at such a rapid rate of speed
and at such an acceleration

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:10%
that they interfere
with our magnetic poles,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:10%
with our North Pole.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence,
it also, because they're

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
so powerful and
highly charged, they

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:84%
can wipe out any
unprotected electronics.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
That would include
our grid, which

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:90%
is highly vulnerable already.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.280 align:middle line:84%
We put so much
demand on that grid

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.050 align:middle line:84%
today that it's
basically on overload.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
We upgrade it, but in
doing that, we're not--

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:84%
it's basically a
jerry-rigged system.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to that, our
electronics, our electronics,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.780 align:middle line:84%
our microchips have become much
more sophisticated, much more

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:90%
delicate.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence,
such a pulse

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
can absolutely knock
out that electronics.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Automated control systems, from
running the gas pump to ATMs.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.170 align:middle line:84%
The automatic systems
for our pipelines.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:84%
We have more than a million
miles of pipelines, oil and gas

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:90%
pipelines.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.550 align:middle line:84%
An EMP can trigger
those automatic systems

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:84%
so that it builds up pressure
from the natural gas,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:90%
can cause explosions.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
There's actually been instances
of that in isolated cases.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Oil pipelines.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Fires can develop.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:84%
But if this were to
happen with an EMP event

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:84%
from a flare or a high
altitude nuclear explosion,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.442 align:middle line:84%
it would cover a far
greater geographical area.

00:04:08.442 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Half the country,
the full country,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:84%
depending upon how
severe the EMP was.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:84%
And it could take months,
years to come back on.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:84%
By then, we will
have had affected

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.506 align:middle line:90%
about 90% of the US population--

00:04:21.506 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dead.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Dead.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:90%
From starvation--

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No water.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.758 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: From disease.

00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:90%
No water.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Medical reasons.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And your urban centers could
be wiped out as a consequence.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we have
seen historically

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
what happens in a
community when you

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:90%
can't have those basic services.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.497 align:middle line:90%
People riot.

00:04:38.497 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People loot.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.247 align:middle line:84%
They do all these other
things to try to survive.

00:04:43.247 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This would be--
gosh-- under biblical terms,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:90%
a catastrophe.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: It would be.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And it would-- and
again, your urban centers

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:90%
would be wiped out.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:84%
You would have secondary
problems emerging,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:90%
such as disease.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Sanitation problems.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:90%
And rioting, as you point out.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Just in the case
of natural events,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:84%
such as hurricanes and
heavy storms, flooding.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Our grocery stores, for
example, have maybe three days

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:90%
of groceries at most.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.737 align:middle line:90%
They'll be wiped out in hours.

00:05:17.737 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Hours.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, we see what
happens during a snowstorm.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.035 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Oh, yeah.

00:05:21.035 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, the
weather man comes in and says,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow we're going to
have a little blizzard.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:90%
The stores are empty.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:90%
The bread, the milk.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Completely.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.259 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It's almost automatic
that they'll do that.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And we have to rely on
distribution systems, which

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
are all automated in many
cases, to deliver those food

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and water and other supplies,
including medication.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
People have maybe, at most,
30 days of their prescription

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:90%
medications.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:90%
All of that would stop.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not a matter of if, but
when one of these two episodes

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:90%
will occur.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.153 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:90%
They can.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.643 align:middle line:84%
And we just dodged
another large flare,

00:05:57.643 --> 00:06:00.150 align:middle line:84%
as you pointed
out in your intro.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned the 1859.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, two years
ago in 2012, NASA

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
reports that we just dodged
another huge one that

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
was at least
comparable to the 1859.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It went off the
side of the sun, right?

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yeah.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:90%
It went off to the side.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
We had a little bit of
effects, but not much.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.777 align:middle line:84%
If that had been a direct hit,
all industrialized countries

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:84%
in the world would
have been affected.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.392 align:middle line:84%
The US the most because we rely
the most on our technology.

00:06:24.392 --> 00:06:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: It has made us the
greatest industrial power

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
in the world as we
are today, however

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:90%
it's also our Achilles heel.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Michael, when you
wrote "A Nation Forsaken," what

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle line:10%
was it that you saw
which got you into this?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.192 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, I have a
few years of experience

00:06:40.192 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:84%
with the federal
government, and we

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:84%
began to see
countries in the work

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:84%
that I did that were
developing and acquiring

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
the means of delivery
systems, or missiles,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and developing a nuclear
weapons capability.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:84%
We also saw testing that told
us it was less for destruction

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:84%
but more to develop more of
a gamma ray type of emission

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:90%
of these nuclear devices.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Low kilotonage but high
emission of gamma rays.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Gamma rays is one form of
electromagnetic energy.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Other forms would be microwaves,
such as off of your radar

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.490 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.609 align:middle line:84%
And even on a lower basis, we
have lone wolves, if you will,

00:07:24.609 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:90%
that are out there today.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Could actually take
surplus radar systems,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.802 align:middle line:84%
point it directly at
buildings, and fry electronics.

00:07:32.802 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:90%
And I think they've done that.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.531 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes, they have.

00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians actually have
had some experiences with that.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:84%
People will go in and
rob some jewelry stores,

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.290 align:middle line:84%
and they've actually
used that device

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:84%
to incapacitate
any alarm systems.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.580 align:middle line:84%
In this edition of
"Beyond Belief,"

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk primarily
about the electromagnetic pulse

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
that would be created
from the detonation

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.520 align:middle line:90%
of a nuke in the atmosphere.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:84%
How high up does that detonation
have to occur, Michael?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: It can occur
from about 35 kilometers,

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:84%
or about 50 miles up on
up to about 300 miles.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:84%
The higher the level,
the greater the coverage.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And dependent upon
the kilotonage,

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
it will determine what
electronics are knocked out,

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:90%
and where.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.820 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
detonate a device,

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.450 align:middle line:84%
let's say, over Washington,
Boston corridor,

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.547 align:middle line:84%
let's say at about
50 miles, that

00:08:32.547 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:90%
would be the most affected area.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:90%
You're hitting the eastern grid.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:40.049 align:middle line:84%
We have three grids--
eastern, western, Texas.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:90%
Eastern grid--

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're
all connected, right?

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: They're all connected.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:90%
They're all connected.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:84%
But there would be
that ripple effect

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.703 align:middle line:84%
that would affect them
all as a consequence.

00:08:46.703 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But the most severe damage
would be the eastern grid,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:90%
in this example.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
The eastern grid alone services
70% of the US population.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:90%
It would be devastating.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
a nation know,

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.700 align:middle line:84%
one, how high up
to go to detonate,

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and two, the megatonnage
of the detonation?

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I think both of
those would have to be ideal,

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.737 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't they?

00:09:09.737 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Not necessarily.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if
you're up too high

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have the mega
detonation power, that's

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:90%
not gonna be effective, is it?

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: The bad
guys know how high

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:84%
they should go for the
maximum impact that they want.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do already?

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, North Korea's
one of the countries

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
that I'm extremely
concerned about right now.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:84%
They have shown examples
of not only missile

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:84%
testing-- their missile
testing has actually

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:84%
been more towards
the South Pole.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
As a consequence, we really
don't have missile defenses

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle line:84%
along our southern
coast, as we should.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Most of ours are located
pointed toward the North Pole.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: And we've seen
in some of their testing

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.550 align:middle line:84%
where they've actually
orbited a satellite.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.270 align:middle line:84%
That satellite, at
about 150, 200 miles up,

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:90%
could be a nuclear device.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And we know they've
been testing,

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and they have actually
threatened us.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And they can actually
detonate on command anywhere

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:90%
in the world as a consequence.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So as a consequence,
you have North Korea

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.576 align:middle line:84%
with this international
capability all of a sudden.

00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:16.283 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Already?

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Because of
this satellite, yeah.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And it can be the nuclear
device, be exploded.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have an
Aegis missile system

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:84%
which is capable of hitting a
satellite at about 153 miles

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.690 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:84%
There's actually been an
actual operational example

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:90%
of that at one time.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you do
that before detonation?

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Would that be OK?

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.145 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: If you could
catch the satellite in time.

00:10:39.145 --> 00:10:40.655 align:middle line:84%
The ideal time to
catch it is when

00:10:40.655 --> 00:10:41.905 align:middle line:90%
the missile is being launched.

00:10:41.905 --> 00:10:43.321 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When it's
being launched.

00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:45.070 align:middle line:10%
>>MALOOF: And we
have Aegis systems

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:10%
in cooperation with Japan, but
you don't know if it's test.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to be
shooting every missile out.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly
you can't do that.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.656 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: You can't do that.

00:10:51.656 --> 00:10:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is why we hold our
breaths every time they

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:55.837 align:middle line:90%
do a missile test.

00:10:55.837 --> 00:10:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are countries
concerned about this?

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.461 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Oh, yeah.

00:10:58.461 --> 00:10:59.862 align:middle line:90%
They're very concerned about it.

00:10:59.862 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Certainly all the
industrialized countries are.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And I would add
that North Korea,

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle line:84%
every time they do a nuclear
test, underground nuclear test

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.800 align:middle line:84%
with low kilotonage
but high gamma rays--

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
that's what some of our
results have shown--

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.600 align:middle line:84%
the North Koreans openly
threaten the United States

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.430 align:middle line:90%
with a nuclear attack.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>>[SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: And they just
did it a few weeks ago,

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.540 align:middle line:84%
saying they wanted to
nuke the White House.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:84%
They've actually released videos
showing nuclear explosions

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
over the Capitol building,
and over Washington,

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.615 align:middle line:90%
over New York City.

00:12:00.615 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And this was-- They do it in a
very professional video format,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and it tells us that they
have something going for them.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a latent threat,
that every time-- and I

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:84%
think it's designed to tell
us to quit doing exercises

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:90%
with the South Koreans.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.600 align:middle line:90%
So there's messages there.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But we know they're
developing that capability,

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.070 align:middle line:90%
and that's for real.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.564 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we're
not providing the missile

00:12:28.564 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:84%
defense systems,
and unfortunately

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.195 align:middle line:84%
the whole issue of EMP
has become politicized.

00:12:32.195 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:84%
People think that our-- that
the-- that the utilities

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.594 align:middle line:84%
are capable of protecting
against such a development.

00:12:44.594 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No way.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:45.801 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: No.

00:12:45.801 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:90%
They cannot.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And especially over
a widespread area.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And they also think that
it's just a cover so

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that the conservatives
can build missile defense

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.271 align:middle line:84%
systems throughout
the United States.

00:12:54.271 --> 00:12:58.070 align:middle line:10%
The reality is we're
not defended adequately,

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.900 align:middle line:10%
and the only thing that we have
going for us are these Aegis

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:10%
systems, which we're actually
deploying in Europe right now,

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.540 align:middle line:10%
which has upset the Russians.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.530 align:middle line:84%
But the Aegis system
is effective up to,

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:10.910 align:middle line:90%
as I said, 150 miles.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they went ahead and
launched a satellite 200, 250

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
miles with a nuclear
device, then it

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:84%
would pose a very
serious problem for us.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about
tracking who did this?

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:90%
That concerns me.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you have a
missile launcher on a boat

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
off the coast of Los
Angeles or New York,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:90%
how do you know who's doing it?

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: You won't.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:10%
And I think that this problem
was accentuated even more

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:10%
earlier this year when a
North Korean freighter was

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.944 align:middle line:10%
seized in the Panama Canal.

00:13:47.944 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
They thought they were going
to get a load of drugs.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
What they discovered, it
had just come from Cuba.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:84%
What they had discovered was
that there were components

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and actually an SA2
missile onboard.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:84%
That is a surface
to air missile.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.920 align:middle line:84%
That goes back to the days
of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.045 align:middle line:84%
That surface to air
missile is nuclear capable.

00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:84%
It was designed to
knock out aircraft.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:15.020 align:middle line:84%
But we assessed that because
the focus at that time in 1962

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.160 align:middle line:84%
on the Cuban Missile Crisis was
on surface to surface missiles

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
to be cleared out, they didn't
care about the surface to air.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And now with the knowledge
of what an EMP can do,

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:90%
they've changed completely.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.730 align:middle line:84%
You could have a freighter off
the east coast, west coast,

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.190 align:middle line:84%
even the Gulf coast, where
we have no protection.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:41.670 align:middle line:10%
You could have it disguised
under a false flag.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:10%
You could put one of
those SA2 missiles

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:10%
with a nuclear device
on it, shoot it up

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.390 align:middle line:10%
over the east coast.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.710 align:middle line:90%
That's all you would need.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you would do
that in coordination

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.935 align:middle line:84%
with other vulnerabilities that
this nation is facing today.

00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
This country is
extremely vulnerable.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.457 align:middle line:84%
Not only just to a missile
attack and an EMP--

00:15:00.457 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Politically vulnerable.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.206 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: We're politically
vulnerable from the standpoint

00:15:04.206 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:84%
of the immigration, the
uncontrolled immigration flow.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we have the
Islamic state coming in.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
We know that al-Qaeda has linked
up with drug cartels, MS-13,

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and already the
drug cartels, MS-13

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:23.420 align:middle line:84%
are located in 1,200
of our US cities.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:84%
This could be an entire
coordinated development.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Come in and
control, knock out the power,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:30.777 align:middle line:90%
and then go in.

00:15:30.777 --> 00:15:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yep.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:32.937 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:15:32.937 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chaos everywhere.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: This is probably
a worst case scenario,

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
but if I can think of it, I
know the bad guys have already.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.223 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know,
and if I were, let's say,

00:15:42.223 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:84%
a nation that couldn't stand
our guts-- let's say Russia.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So you put together
this under the auspices

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:56.460 align:middle line:84%
of a terrorist group that
somehow obtained a nuke,

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and so they take themselves
out of the picture.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're not going to
retaliate against the Russians.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:90%
They didn't do this.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.275 align:middle line:84%
But they fund, they create,
they get it all together,

00:16:07.275 --> 00:16:08.525 align:middle line:90%
and they have that capability.

00:16:08.525 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you get a
missile launcher on a ship,

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
send it off on the west coast
or the east coast, and do it.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And look at the chaos
that will happen.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.670 align:middle line:84%
One, we're not going to
retaliate against the Russians

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
because, theoretically,
we don't know who did it.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:84%
This may be the most damaging
possibility I can think of.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, that's why I say
that the EMP threat is perhaps

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.210 align:middle line:84%
the most serious threat today
to our national security.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And because of these
unknowns, and I

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:84%
think that we need
to prepare for them.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.525 align:middle line:84%
And the tragedy of it all
is that it's all fixable.

00:16:43.525 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm
amazed, Michael,

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.937 align:middle line:90%
it hasn't happened yet.

00:16:45.937 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we've
joined with you

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
to try and make it
happen with legislation.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.620 align:middle line:84%
The federal government has
known about the impact of an EMP

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.440 align:middle line:90%
for well over 50 years.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is criminal for
them not to fix the grid system.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: I agree.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The money we spent
during the 2008 bailout

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:10%
was absolutely enormous.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.319 align:middle line:84%
We're estimating $1 billion
to $4 billion to fix the grid,

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:90%
insulate it.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:90%
That's nothing.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.153 align:middle line:90%
I call it chump change.

00:17:15.153 --> 00:17:15.819 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: It is.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:90%
In today's terms, it is.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.065 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's do it.

00:17:18.065 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at a scenario.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:90%
We fix the grid system.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:90%
We insulate it.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.169 align:middle line:84%
Someone still tries to detonate
a nuke in the atmosphere.

00:17:27.169 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Something will
happen, but because you're

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.890 align:middle line:84%
going to be insulating and
preparing and hardening

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:84%
the most critical of
your infrastructures,

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.970 align:middle line:84%
your life sustaining
infrastructures, your grid,

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:90%
certainly.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not a devastation.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: It's
not a devastation.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:90%
You'll mitigate the problem.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.842 align:middle line:84%
You won't knock it out-- you
won't eliminate it entirely.

00:17:50.842 --> 00:17:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But at least you'll
have something.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to still
have communications.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:84%
You'll still be able to
probably have electricity, be

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:90%
able to function.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.189 align:middle line:90%
Your emergency services.

00:17:59.189 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your phones
will still work.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:01.605 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: They could.

00:18:01.605 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:90%
If they're hardened.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:90%
If everything is hardened.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Right now, this
minute, it will just

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
knock out your telecommunication
systems completely, as well as

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:90%
the satellites.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People can't text.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:90%
They'll go crazy.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: I know.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if we do insulate
it and spend the money,

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.767 align:middle line:84%
at least we have a nation
that can fight back.

00:18:16.767 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It will mitigate one serious
flaw in our national security

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:90%
breakdown.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:90%
And we really have it right now.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:90%
And this is a very serious one.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.080 align:middle line:84%
It was the Russians,
actually, who

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:84%
got us to focus on this
problem in the early '80s.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they trying
to insulate their grid?

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: They have.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:90%
They're doing it now.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are?

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yeah.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Any country-- what I've
discovered is that any

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:90%
country--

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.748 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:18:44.748 --> 00:18:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: That has experienced
warfare on its soil

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:84%
knows about EMP and is
doing something about it.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.555 align:middle line:90%
The Israelis, the Chinese.

00:18:54.555 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a few
states are doing it.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: The Russians.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On their own?

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:10%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think because
India, Pakistan have nukes

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:84%
aimed at each other, they
know the impact of an EMP.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:90%
They're also doing it.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:90%
The Iranians know about it.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not too
difficult to do?

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.970 align:middle line:90%
To insulate?

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: No.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:84%
As long as you're willing to
put the commitment in there.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The technology's there.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: And the
technology is there.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:90%
The technology is there.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.270 align:middle line:90%
That's why--

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Put together some great
engineers and turn them loose.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.215 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yeah.

00:19:21.215 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you'd see, if
we had-- in the US, if we had,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:84%
let's say the president with
his pen and phone, for example,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.450 align:middle line:84%
with an executive order,
could order the DHS,

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:84%
the Department of
Homeland Security,

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:34.775 align:middle line:90%
immediately to declare--

00:19:34.775 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To declare
this right now.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.533 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Right now.

00:19:36.533 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Right now, because
right now, EMP

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:43.580 align:middle line:84%
is not one of its 15
national planning scenarios.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:84%
With the stroke of a
pen, he can make it

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and order it done
because of this threat.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is is that
because DHS hasn't done it,

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.400 align:middle line:84%
our emergency services at
the state and local levels

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
that take DHS's cue on how
to prepare for disasters

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:90%
is not doing it, either.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if-- here's
my conspiratorial mind here,

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Michael.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:08.270 align:middle line:84%
What if they want
this to happen?

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.780 align:middle line:84%
What if the reason they
haven't moved ahead

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:84%
to do what is probably the most
obvious thing I've ever seen--

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and that's fix the grid
because we're reliant

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
on electricity-- what if
they want this to happen?

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.430 align:middle line:90%
It would crush the nation.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Why would they
want to crush the nation?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.208 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's assume
we've got these one world

00:20:25.208 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:84%
government fanatics that
think, you know what?

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's just get into
the club, but we

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.440 align:middle line:84%
have to do it by breaking
down the United States.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's eliminate the population.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:90%
We want population control.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.307 align:middle line:84%
And let's just let this
happen at one time.

00:20:40.307 --> 00:20:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, if you want
to carry it to that extreme,

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:90%
I guess that's possible.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, why else
would you not do this?

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.506 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Right.

00:20:45.506 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:10%
Well, and I think that
this is-- more and more

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.300 align:middle line:10%
people are coming around
to that general thinking,

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:10%
just from the comments that
I receive from my articles

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.330 align:middle line:10%
at WMD on this,
more and more people

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:10%
are expressing that concern now.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.020 align:middle line:10%
Why hasn't it been done?

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't the federal
government focusing on it?

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they up to?

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yeah.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.290 align:middle line:84%
The Department of
Defense knows about it.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
They are hardening
their systems,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.810 align:middle line:90%
their operational systems.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
However, their bases
throughout the country

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.320 align:middle line:90%
rely 99% on the electrical grid.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:90%
They could be knocked out.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:18.640 align:middle line:90%
They don't have backups.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
They have generators, but
that only lasts for as long

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:84%
as there's fuel
for the generators.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And if there's electrical
components to them, forget it.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:90%
They're knocked out.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, how do you
communicate with your subs

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.000 align:middle line:90%
to say launch?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yeah.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.478 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know, retaliate.

00:21:30.478 --> 00:21:31.177 align:middle line:90%
Do this.

00:21:31.177 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: It will
be very problematic.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.680 align:middle line:84%
The satellites could
be knocked out.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So in terms of trying
to get legislation passed,

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the campaign
we're undertaking--

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Nick Begich, of course, has
written a book about HAARP.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:84%
His brother's Mark
Begich, from Alaska.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I've asked him to
get Mark involved

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.622 align:middle line:90%
in something like this, too.

00:21:49.622 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:90%
What else is out there?

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Who else is out there
that could help?

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.970 align:middle line:10%
>>MALOOF: Well, we have
established an informal EMP

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:10%
coalition of people that
comprise Newt Gingrich,

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:10%
former Speaker of the House.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.176 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This was a
major issue for him.

00:22:04.176 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:10%
>>MALOOF: Oh, yes.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.790 align:middle line:10%
He's the only one during the
presidential campaign last time

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.590 align:middle line:10%
to, when asked
the question, what

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:10%
is your greatest national
security concern,

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:10%
he says an EMP attack.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.426 align:middle line:84%
And everyone just
went, what's that?

00:22:16.426 --> 00:22:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that?

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: They had no idea.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:19.153 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:19.153 --> 00:22:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: But he's
very aware of it.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:84%
He knows the implications
of such a development.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And I would add that because
he was a member of Congress,

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
he was very much
knowledgeable and involved

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:84%
with the congressionally
mandated EMP commission

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.017 align:middle line:84%
that in 2008 outlined
all of these concerns

00:22:40.017 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:90%
and recommendations.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
happened to it?

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: And made
recommendations.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.420 align:middle line:84%
None of the recommendations
were implemented.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were accepted.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: That's right.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
program is dead?

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: It was a commission
that issued a report.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:84%
That report is
available, even on--

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We wouldn't even
need a new commission.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:90%
You just take the report.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Just take the report.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:90%
It's still very valid today.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.570 align:middle line:84%
That report is
readily available.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.680 align:middle line:84%
You can just Google it,
and it's EMP Commission,

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and the whole PDF,
it's right there.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:90%
It's over 200 pages.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do we
need to do, though,

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.330 align:middle line:84%
to get legislators in the
Senate and the Congress

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:84%
to simply say, one guy, I'm
going to initiate legislation

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:90%
to get the grid insulated?

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, there
has been legislation

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.820 align:middle line:84%
introduced in this
latest Congress.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:90%
The house has an EMP caucus.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:31.320 align:middle line:84%
It's chaired by representative
Trent Franks of Arizona.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:90%
He's been pushing this.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And it has passed
the House, called

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.280 align:middle line:90%
the Shield Act, a few times.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It just can never get
passed in the Senate.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.610 align:middle line:84%
We have some people who are
very much in the pockets

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:84%
of the utilities, who just
refuse to go along with that.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Primarily out of cost and
the time it would take.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if you had, at
the national level, just an EMP

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.630 align:middle line:84%
coordinator under the
National Security Council,

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.830 align:middle line:84%
again, something that
the president could

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:84%
do without legislation,
he could coordinate,

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.710 align:middle line:90%
or she could coordinate that.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.160 align:middle line:84%
All of the federal,
state, local efforts to--

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:09.845 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: To do this.

00:24:09.845 --> 00:24:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And even then, even then it's
going to take a good five

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:84%
years, so we're on
extremely borrowed time.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And it could happen anytime.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Anytime.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anytime.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Anytime.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In our next episode,
we'll talk about X flares.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:84%
That's something we
can't control right now.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: That's correct.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I were Mark
Zuckerberg from Facebook,

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
or Bill Gates from Microsoft,
I would say, all right,

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Maloof says it's going
to cost $2 billion.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:84%
If this happens,
I'm out of business.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Facebook goes down,
Microsoft goes down.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.350 align:middle line:90%
We all go down.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:90%
That's chump change.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.893 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:24:43.893 --> 00:24:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So why don't we, Mr.
Zuckerberg, and me, Mr. Gates,

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.680 align:middle line:84%
let's each put a billion
dollars into the deal

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.100 align:middle line:90%
and do it privately.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Could that be done?

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.831 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Oh, sure.

00:24:53.831 --> 00:24:56.316 align:middle line:90%
It could be done.

00:24:56.316 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But you want to make
sure there's consistency

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:84%
across the country, and that's
why the national legislation is

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
important, because it will set
out standards and criteria so

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:90%
that you have a uniformity.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the federal
government hasn't acted,

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:84%
we've now tried to
take a different route,

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and that is go to the states.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:84%
That's still an
important approach

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:84%
in which we're trying to
approach governors, state

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.600 align:middle line:90%
legislators.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.900 align:middle line:84%
State legislatures
do have oversight

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.892 align:middle line:84%
of the utilities,
public utilities.

00:25:24.892 --> 00:25:26.600 align:middle line:84%
We're going in those
directions, but it's

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:84%
going to be very uneven
in terms of implementation

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and what's actually passed
within the implementation.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
That's why we need
a national standard.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why the federal
legislation is there.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And it will ensure that hardware
is strengthened in order

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.710 align:middle line:84%
to deal with this EMP
across the country.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What I'm concerned
about is the I told you so.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to god,
Michael, that you and I

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.155 align:middle line:84%
don't have to say
that to anybody.

00:25:52.155 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, it
would be a crying shame.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I've had one experience
on my watch go sour,

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:90%
and I still regret it, even now.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.700 align:middle line:84%
When I was at the Defense
Department and we could have

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.826 align:middle line:84%
done something about
it, but we didn't.

00:26:06.826 --> 00:26:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A couple years
ago I was in Saint Louis,

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and a local drugstore
lost its power.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Well known chain.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the lights are out, it's
daytime, and I drive in there.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, I needed to
pick up some stuff.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, well,
maybe it's not even open.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:90%
They were open.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And there were lines of
people at the cash register--

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:84%
that was not working-- and
I'm talking to the manager,

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.040 align:middle line:90%
saying, well, are you open?

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Have you closed?

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:84%
He said no, no, we're open,
and we're doing this manually.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Within 10 minutes, Michael,
that line of 10 people

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:46.510 align:middle line:84%
was now 75, with people
saying, hurry up!

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:90%
Get this done.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:53.520 align:middle line:84%
The poor cashier is trying to
figure this stuff out manually.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:90%
So my bill's $72.18.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Here's my credit card.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, it won't work.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.368 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: That's right.

00:27:02.368 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, sir,
do you have cash?

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.125 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, here's cash.

00:27:05.125 --> 00:27:06.500 align:middle line:84%
But the cashier
doesn't even know

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.280 align:middle line:84%
how much change
to give you back,

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.505 align:middle line:84%
because they're not trained
in mathematics anymore.

00:27:10.505 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: That's right.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.301 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:27:11.301 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those days are gone.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Store manager came back to
all of us and said, I'm sorry,

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.640 align:middle line:90%
we're closed.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Just put your items away.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Soon as the power comes
back, we're ready.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:84%
That's a small,
tiny little example

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.657 align:middle line:84%
of what will be magnitude
across the country.

00:27:26.657 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.892 align:middle line:84%
Well, the whole
country will shut down.

00:27:28.892 --> 00:27:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Whole country will shut down.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:90%
All of your vital--

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can't get your money.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.370 align:middle line:90%
You can't get gasoline.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: No, you can't.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
You won't be able to get any of
your life sustaining needs met,

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we're
suggesting that a good portion

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.852 align:middle line:84%
of the population would be wiped
out from starvation and death.

00:27:45.852 --> 00:27:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think you're
absolutely right.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.976 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that's going

00:27:48.976 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
to last much longer
than one or two days.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:10%
>>MALOOF: This could
last months, maybe years.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Just on some of
these, it depends

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:58.120 align:middle line:84%
upon how quickly we'd
be able to respond,

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and if the whole
world was affected,

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.690 align:middle line:84%
we would be standing
in line like everybody

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.534 align:middle line:90%
else for a number of years.

00:28:05.534 --> 00:28:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, in addition
to everything else,

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:11.920 align:middle line:84%
he who launches the EMP
attack has a secondary plan,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.420 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Sure.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:13.950 align:middle line:90%
They'd have to.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm very
concerned about the existing

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.750 align:middle line:84%
vulnerabilities that we have
coming in from the south,

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.180 align:middle line:90%
with this EMP just being the--

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Catalyst.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, it could be
the frosting on the cake.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: It could be the
crowning glory, if you will.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Once there's all this
other havoc going on,

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.090 align:middle line:90%
it'll be a distraction.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And then this thing happens,
and you're not expecting it.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:90%
And then it's too late.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Then it's too late.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.324 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've warned them.

00:28:42.324 --> 00:28:43.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to say it again.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
say I told you so,

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:48.291 align:middle line:84%
but what needs to
be done immediately?

00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: We need to get
the legislation passed,

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:54.780 align:middle line:84%
start getting this country at
a level of focus and attention

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:58.340 align:middle line:84%
on this that treats this
as a national security

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:90%
priority for this country.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why Congress
needs to be giving

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:84%
this the utmost of priorities
as soon as they come back

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:84%
in the next session, next
year, early next year,

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and move this through
very, very rapidly.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully November
elections will change things

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
in the Senate, that we can move
these things through and compel

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.470 align:middle line:90%
the president to sign it.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And if he decides to
veto, override the veto.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think our
campaign will at least make

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:84%
them a little more aware
of getting this done?

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Oh, absolutely.

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Given your outreach,
and ours, I think

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that combining our
resources like this

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.460 align:middle line:90%
is going to be important.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.430 align:middle line:84%
We are educating the people
on what the problem is.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not just us
whistling about this.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.640 align:middle line:84%
We have experts who say that
this is what can happen.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.929 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
documentation to show it.

00:29:50.929 --> 00:29:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the
EMP commission, which

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.220 align:middle line:84%
was congressionally mandated,
said the same thing,

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:90%
it's good as gold.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder if we can get
a live hearing before Congress

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.259 align:middle line:90%
where we participate.

00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I would go there,
you would be there,

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.764 align:middle line:84%
Forstchen would be
there, and experts.

00:30:06.764 --> 00:30:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Mm-hm.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.769 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And clearly
get this message across.

00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if there's any
way we can get that done?

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:84%
A public hearing on
national television.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, I
think-- there have

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
been occasional congressional
hearings on what

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.256 align:middle line:90%
the EMP is about.

00:30:23.256 --> 00:30:25.380 align:middle line:84%
I think we would need to
get with the right people,

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.080 align:middle line:84%
with the EMP caucus,
coordinate something with them.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.093 align:middle line:84%
Maybe get Trent Franks
on your program.

00:30:30.093 --> 00:30:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd love to.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Peter Pry
is another person.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.950 align:middle line:90%
He wrote the forward to my book.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:84%
He was the staff director
to the EMP commission.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.220 align:middle line:90%
He's very knowledgeable.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.792 align:middle line:84%
Former CIA guy, and
he knows his stuff.

00:30:44.792 --> 00:30:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Along with Jim Woolsey.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Get Jim Woolsey on board.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I think when you get these folks
who are living and breathing

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.040 align:middle line:84%
this issue today,
it's going to work.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.560 align:middle line:10%
Frank Gaffney is another
one from the Center

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:10%
for Security Policy
in Washington.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of
this EMP coalition,

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and I think that it's going
to be necessary to accentuate

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:09.750 align:middle line:90%
this and actually accelerate it.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's set
it up for a Coast to Coast

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:12.520 align:middle line:90%
show to start.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: OK.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:13.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's get
them all together.

00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: OK.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right?

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Absolutely.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your little
project to help us.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: OK.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm on board.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Thank you.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In an upcoming episode
on "Beyond Belief," Michael

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Maloof and I will talk
about X flares from the sun.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:31.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just an EMP attack
that could knock out the grid.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:34.540 align:middle line:10%
A solar flare could do
the very same thing,

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.650 align:middle line:10%
and we'll talk about
that in an upcoming

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.020 align:middle line:10%
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:55.167 align:middle line:90%
