00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:24.468 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.320 align:middle line:90%
This is a smartphone.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:10%
It is on the 4G network.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.310 align:middle line:10%
But assuming in the next
few months to a year,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:10%
it'll jump to the 5G network.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So we've got researcher
Ben Stewart with us

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:84%
to talk about 5G, how it plays
into our current reality,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and how it affects
our human potential.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Ben, welcome to the program.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.557 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN STEWART: Thank you
so much for having me back.

00:00:49.557 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
difference between 4G and 5G?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, the whole
thing with the numbers and the G

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.190 align:middle line:84%
is basically the generation
of telecommunications.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:10%
So 1G all the way to 3G--

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:10%
3G was where
smartphones started.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:10%
4G was the next evolution of it.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:84%
5G is really, a lot of people
are saying it's a faster phone,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
it's faster internet, but
it's a deeper infrastructure

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:90%
embedded into our world.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just about
the phone anymore.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And the phone may
not actually even

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:90%
be as relevant in the 5G world.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can this phone
function in the 5G world?

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.022 align:middle line:84%
Or does the owner of this
phone need to get a new one?

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well,
these are probably

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.625 align:middle line:84%
going to be retrofitted so
there will be new phones

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and people will probably start
getting rid of these ones.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:84%
These will still work in the
5G world, but in the 5G world,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:84%
the new phones are also
going to, in a sense,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:84%
outsource a lot of what they
do on the phone to the city

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.510 align:middle line:90%
that you live in.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:10%
And the 5G world that
we're talking about,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:10%
it's not just the
internet company,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:10%
it's not just the cell
towers, what it is, is it's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:10%
an infrastructure
that leads us deeper

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.685 align:middle line:10%
into a surveillance state.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:90%
How would that work?

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well,
currently as we speak,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:84%
there are satellites
going up, 5G satellites.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So whereas before,
you needed to be

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:84%
somewhere on planet Earth near
a cell tower to get service.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.965 align:middle line:84%
Soon, we're going to have 5G
pumping all over the world.

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
You could be in the
middle of the ocean

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
eventually and still be
able to get your 5G service.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And so
what most people

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
are thinking about is, will
you be able to download

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:90%
a movie far quicker?

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.560 align:middle line:84%
What used to take
maybe 30, 40 minutes,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
you could download
in a couple seconds.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.762 align:middle line:90%
And so that's incredible.

00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:34.562 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That fast.

00:02:34.562 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:90%
That is incredible.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.223 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, we
need let's say driving--

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:90%
self-driving cars.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:90%
It needs high speed internet.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:90%
It can't have lag time.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it may miss its turn.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
explanation as to why

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
we need to move into a 5G
world, but what it really

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
is most people aren't getting
the full story of what

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
the infrastructure of
5G has to do to support

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:90%
such high-speed internet.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then why do they
have to shut our phones off

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.313 align:middle line:90%
on a plane?

00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, mainly
because of the interference.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly the planes have
their own frequencies going,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and if everyone
has their phone on

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and there's data from
the cell towers going

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:84%
to all these phones
on the plane,

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
then it interrupts a lot of
the technology on the planes.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so
it's a safety thing.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Right, and I think
in the way of the future, that's

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.660 align:middle line:84%
also not going to matter because
I think where we are getting

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
our signal from is going
to start-- it's not

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.933 align:middle line:90%
going to be certain nodes.

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Like, yes, there will
be the satellites,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.310 align:middle line:84%
there will be the
towers, but it's

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
going to be ever
present in the world.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.175 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we are
swimming in EMS.

00:03:38.175 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:90%
We're swimming in a--

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, bombarding
us everywhere.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: At least 100
million times more emphasis

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:84%
than our grandparents
dealt with,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:84%
but we don't see it, smell
it, taste it, hear it.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And some people say
they can hear it

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
but it's called
microwave hearing.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you have a
5G phone, and most people

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:84%
put their phones by their
bed when they sleep.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I know what I do is I keep it
plugged in so I'm at 100% power

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:90%
when I wake up.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Is that dangerous if it's
within 3 feet of you?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I touch technology
all the time, I'm a filmmaker.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And I notice very little health
effects from it but that's also

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
because I try and
keep my health up.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, the people
who are immune-compromised

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:84%
might have problems with
holding technology all the time,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're
holding it up to your head.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.373 align:middle line:84%
I would say we need to start
mitigating the problems.

00:04:28.373 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to be talking
on the phone, put it on speaker

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.120 align:middle line:90%
and set it down.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
ability to do that.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
If we were to wake up into
a smarter way of using

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:90%
the system that we are--

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:90%
there's no outrunning 5G.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:84%
We're entering this
world no matter what.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.603 align:middle line:84%
It's already happening
in China right now.

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a big way.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.620 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, Wuhan, China,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.080 align:middle line:84%
it's fully 5G
compatible, isn't it?

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Fully-blanketed city.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the first
fully-blanketed 5G city.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is, so
that phone that you have,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:90%
that's the platform.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And in the 4G world,
you can opt out

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:84%
by let's say getting
rid of your phone,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
running off into the
mountains and hiding.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:84%
In a 5G world,
you can't opt out.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So the phone is less
needed because if you're

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
in a city like Wuhan, China,
you step out your door

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.182 align:middle line:90%
and you say Uber.

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:18.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to say
it into your phone,

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.692 align:middle line:84%
a self-driving
car might come up.

00:05:20.692 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wait a minute.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.387 align:middle line:84%
You just say Uber into the
ether and an Uber shows up?

00:05:25.387 --> 00:05:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: There's
cameras everywhere.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So right now, there's a
billion cameras in China.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.560 align:middle line:84%
By 2022, there will be two
cameras for every one citizen.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So the system, like whereas
right now your phone is always

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
picking up what you're
saying, the metadata

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:84%
is going to data companies,
and that's deciding

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:90%
what media to send you.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't get a
response back, can you,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:90%
without the phone?

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: No, without
the phone, you can't.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
But potentially, I mean,
if a camera is close enough

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:84%
to hear you, then there could
be a speaker system or Siri

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:90%
embedded into Wuhan, China.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you say Uber, a car
comes up, it sees who you are.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:90%
The car does.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:90%
It knows your digital identity.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.210 align:middle line:90%
It docks your pay from that--

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.618 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: You say, I want
to get a bucket of chicken

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:90%
at the local store.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:90%
It brings you there.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.260 align:middle line:90%
The store sees you coming.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Their algorithm
detects your face.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Even if you have
a mask on, it can

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
detect who you are based on
your height, the way you walk,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:90%
several different parameters.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.440 align:middle line:84%
It knows what you ordered, it
hands it to you, you grab it,

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:90%
the Uber takes you back home.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:90%
That's the 5G world.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.618 align:middle line:84%
Not only can you not opt out
but there's a brigadier general

00:06:31.618 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:90%
who's talking about this.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
He retired because of where the
surveillance state is heading.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
He's saying you don't know
where the data is going, who's

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:90%
using it, or for what purposes.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or who's getting it.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:84%
How does 5G exactly work
technically from 4G?

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.450 align:middle line:90%
What have they done?

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, so now, instead
of having towers every several

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:90%
miles, these tall towers, now--

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For 4G?

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: For 4G,
where there are really,

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:90%
really big tall masts.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're going to have
things the size of a shoe

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:84%
box every couple
hundred feet on top

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
of or on the side
of every building.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:90%
So you go to--

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --trees,
wherever, right?

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, anywhere.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So you go to Sydney, you'll
see every other light

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:90%
pole has 5G masts on it.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.283 align:middle line:90%
Why so many?

00:07:17.283 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well,
because several things.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
The way 5G works is
a millimeter wave.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So it works on the
different frequency

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and there's actually-- you need
to have it more spread out.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And for such fast
internet speeds,

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
what we're going to
need is these things

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:84%
need to be in closer
proximity to our technology.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's the platform,
that's the infrastructure.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And really, what it is,
what we're talking about

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:84%
is it's like
building a terrarium.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
It's building an environment
for certain kind of creature.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's no longer just human
creatures we're talking about.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I think in the future
we're going to have drones

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.418 align:middle line:90%
the size of mosquitoes or nuts.

00:07:56.418 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They already have
little ones like that.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And you won't be able to tell
what they are but high fidelity

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.240 align:middle line:84%
video, high fidelity
audio, and everything

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.950 align:middle line:84%
you say can be picked
up by these things

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:84%
that you think is
a bug listening in

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:90%
on your conversation.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:84%
The data gets
transcribed and that

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:90%
goes into a central database.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a
surveillance state

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.140 align:middle line:84%
where back in the
Orwellian days,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.770 align:middle line:84%
you would always see this
human behind the visor

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
or the TV saying like, what
are these people doing?

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:30.140 align:middle line:84%
It's very little human activity
surveilling the world now.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:84%
What it is AI computers,
supercomputers,

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:90%
quantum computers.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.933 align:middle line:90%
So it's every little thing.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Like you can have a
little mosquito that

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle line:84%
thinks like a quantum computer,
which what that means is

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:84%
it predicts future
probable outcomes.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So these little things
that are flying around us,

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:84%
gathering all our
data are smarter

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
than I would say a lot of
people because they are using

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
super computing technology and
it's going through this 5G grid

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:90%
to this tiny little drone.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, here's Bloomberg
News on the race for 5G.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.253 align:middle line:10%
>> So what are the
trends of the future?

00:09:06.253 --> 00:09:08.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we're going to
be talking a lot about

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:10%
the connected life and the next
generation of networks called

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:10%
5G.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.320 align:middle line:10%
And this is, as
Tim Cook was just

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:10%
saying, this is going to
transform the way we work,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:10%
the way we live, and the way we
play for the next generation,

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.923 align:middle line:10%
even more than we
have in the last 10.

00:09:22.923 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's 100 times faster
than speeds we have now.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:25.510 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.343 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean?

00:09:26.343 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:10%
What's possible?

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:10%
>> There's no lag time.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.300 align:middle line:10%
And so if a car is
going 60 miles an hour

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.460 align:middle line:10%
down the highway
in a 4G network,

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:10%
it would stop in 4.6 feet.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:10%
Under a 5G scenario, that same
60-mile-an-hour car would stop

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:10%
in an inch.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.240 align:middle line:10%
So it really does
let you do autonomous

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:10%
cars and remote
surgeries, all kinds

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:10%
of things with
these new networks.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, Ben.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.700 align:middle line:84%
She makes 5G sound
like it's a panacea.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.935 align:middle line:90%
What are we missing here?

00:09:52.935 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, I think
she did a pretty good job,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think
most of the population

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:84%
really knows how
to conceptualize

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:90%
what's being built here.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So what she's leaving
out is she said

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:90%
100,000 times faster internet.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:84%
But what that means is
we're also producing data.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:84%
The internet is 30 years
old, and the amount

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:84%
of data we've produced
is incredible.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:90%
So where does all that data go?

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Into these supercomputers.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.870 align:middle line:90%
What is that there to do?

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.790 align:middle line:90%
It's to predict human behavior.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:84%
It's to study human
behavior and to predict it.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So what we're building,
what she was leaving out

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:90%
is where this is all heading.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:90%
We're building the environment.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Like a terrarium, we're building
the environment for something

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:90%
to eventually grow in there.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.277 align:middle line:90%
But that's AI.

00:10:37.277 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that a good thing
or a bad thing, in your opinion?

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, I don't
even put it into those terms,

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:84%
because I feel
like most people--

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I always study
conspiracy theory,

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and all the conspiracy theorists
are saying that this 5G

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.580 align:middle line:90%
world is the end game.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's dangerous.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's going
to be the end of us.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's many ways
of mitigating the harms of 5G.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And also, I think that where 5G
is leading us in the conspiracy

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:84%
world is really only a few
degrees away from a utopian

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:84%
world, where, if all of
this-- if the data was

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:84%
open source, if there
was crypto or, let's say,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.640 align:middle line:84%
blockchain technology that kept
everybody who was using data

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.558 align:middle line:84%
more accountable, then this
wouldn't be the scary world

00:11:18.558 --> 00:11:19.850 align:middle line:90%
that everyone's thinking about.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is actually
a perfect opportunity for us

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.620 align:middle line:84%
to wake up and actually step
into a world that's a bit more

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.420 align:middle line:90%
utopian than that dystopian.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Resonance" is a film
that we played on the Gaia

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:84%
program "Beings of
Frequency" that explores

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:90%
just how we're connected.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually, they came
up with an exact frequency.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:10%
The pulse of the
Earth, human resonance

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:10%
was exactly 7.83 Hertz.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:10%
Their discovery was remarkable.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:10%
Human resonance wasn't just
similar to the alpha waves

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.290 align:middle line:10%
of the human brain,
it was identical.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:10%
The brain's frequency, which
controlled our creativity,

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.160 align:middle line:10%
our performance, our stress,
anxiety, and our immune system

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.380 align:middle line:10%
had somehow tuned in to the
frequency of the planet.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:10%
The pulse of the Earth had
become the pulse of life

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:10%
itself.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.560 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So tell us about
your thoughts of that.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.513 align:middle line:90%
Is that accurate?

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It absolutely is.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:84%
We are beings of frequency,
and our environment

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:84%
has this thing called
this human resonance.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.225 align:middle line:90%
And that allows us to live.

00:12:36.225 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:90%
It matches our alpha brain.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's within
the human being.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that is the
frequency that, in a sense,

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.800 align:middle line:90%
gives us the pulse of life.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we really need 5G?

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Can't we get by with this phone?

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: We can, yes.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think now we're getting
into what is the agenda.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Why do we need this--

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why do we need this--

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --rapidly expanding
the technological world.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what's beyond 5G?

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there 6G?

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Is there 7G?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: China is
already working on 6G.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So China is ahead
of the US in 5G

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:84%
because it started
noticing that,

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:84%
because the US was ahead
in our personal devices--

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that's 4G world-- they wanted
to get ahead of the curve on 5G.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And now so they're
already working

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:84%
on 6G, which we can't
conceptualize yet

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
because most people can't
even conceptualize what 5G is.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, they can't.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So it will be
more radiation for sure,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
but what it is--
like 5G is-- still

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:84%
so many people are talking
about what the radiation is

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:90%
going to do to the body.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm more curious about what is
this technology growing to be,

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:84%
because what I think
it is, if we look back

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:84%
to Rudolf Steiner,
who was talking

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.160 align:middle line:84%
about electromagnetic
radiation in 1978--

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
or in 1917, he was talking
about this thing called

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
the advent of Ahriman, which is
a god built off of technology,

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.295 align:middle line:90%
and calculating very cold.

00:13:54.295 --> 00:13:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what we're building.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:84%
We're building an AI god
on a biological Earth.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
But this is actually maybe
a blessing in disguise

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.860 align:middle line:84%
because, if there's
no stopping 5G,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:84%
you can't run into
the mountains anymore.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
The world is blanketed
in 5G and surveillance.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you can't escape it,
you have to transcend it.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And so this is actually
the perfect opportunity

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:90%
for a mass awakening.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's
beautiful about it

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
is the infrastructure is
currently being held by what we

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:90%
would call the elite, the 1%.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And nobody seems
to trust that 1%.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But if it were to
be in the hands,

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:84%
if this infrastructure
were to be open source

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and in the hands
of people, I think

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.110 align:middle line:84%
we would see the biggest
art revolution in the world.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:84%
There have been some tragedies
surrounding 5G towers, where

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
people have taken it
in their own hands

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and have destroyed the
towers because they're afraid

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.270 align:middle line:90%
of this technology.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.798 align:middle line:84%
Is that going to
become more widespread?

00:14:56.798 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I think it is.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:90%
And I also--

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I think those are
powerful statements,

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not the type
to go out and protest.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the type to go out and
show that kind of an expression

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.420 align:middle line:84%
because I feel the world
that we're moving into,

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
there are some that
want the AI world.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think the AI world is
not the end of the human world,

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.660 align:middle line:84%
it's just the way
it looks right now.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.300 align:middle line:84%
How can we possibly
coexist with technology?

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that we
can, but it's not going

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:90%
to happen by signs of violence.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen that footage
of people taking down

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:84%
these towers, burning
them because they think

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:90%
this is a risk to our health.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.502 align:middle line:84%
But we can mitigate
the health risks,

00:15:38.502 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
but you don't hear
these people who

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.920 align:middle line:84%
are against 5G talking about how
this could potentially benefit

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
our human health by sending
us, like that woman was saying,

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle line:90%
remote surgery.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you're
getting surgery done

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:84%
not by shaking hands of a
human, but laser precision,

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:84%
maybe even technology
that's the size-- that's

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.450 align:middle line:84%
microscopic, and can go inside
and actually do the job,

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.445 align:middle line:84%
and you won't even have much
of a recovery time afterwards.

00:16:06.445 --> 00:16:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you imagine a
laser going through your heart

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.700 align:middle line:84%
arteries that might be
clogged, rather than

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.460 align:middle line:84%
some doctor with
an angiogram trying

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:90%
to pierce his way through?

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Look at 3D printers,
how precise they are,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and how they can
pierce through, not

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:84%
make any effect in the epoxy
or whatever the medium is here,

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.010 align:middle line:90%
but then make an effect here.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So we could be able to do that,
pierce into the body where

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.410 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't affect the
skin or the tissues,

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
but then it goes exactly
where it needs to.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.610 align:middle line:84%
That's the world we
could be moving into.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, how
much radiation are

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
we going to be bombarded
with with the 5G?

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well,
before 5G, there

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:84%
is already 100 million
times more radiation

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:84%
than our grandparents,
just 50 years ago.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that woman was saying
100,000 times faster internet.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about another
increase, about 100,000

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:84%
or 100 million times more
radiation in this new world

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, this new world is
starting in the cities,

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's moving
out into suburbia.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It's already up above our
heads in the satellites.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.307 align:middle line:84%
So it's not going to
be the Orwellian state

00:17:14.307 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:90%
that we think it's going to be.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:16.679 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't know if
you watch "Westworld."

00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:19.547 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: They're really
showing us where it's going

00:17:19.547 --> 00:17:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and what the data is
doing, because it's

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.430 align:middle line:84%
predicting who people are
going to grow up to be.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:84%
There are some
pitfalls to it, but I

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:84%
think that there's
actually incredible amounts

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:31.730 align:middle line:90%
of opportunity.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But we, the humans,
need to wake up.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.050 align:middle line:84%
We can't wait for our leaders
or AI to bring in this utopia.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.190 align:middle line:90%
We need to build it.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Ben, here's
President Trump's uncle,

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:84%
John Trump, talking about
the exposure to radiation.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> My involvement with that
generator and accelerator

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:90%
system was always peripheral.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:84%
At Round Hill, Lester
and Chester Van Atta

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:84%
worked with Van de
Graaff to build it.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And at Round Hill, they
produced 5 and 1/2 million volts

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:90%
between the two terminals.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And they did stretch a
horizontal evacuated tube

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:90%
between the two terminals.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But that particular
effort was not successful,

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
partly because the radiation
efforts were so high,

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:84%
but partly also because
there was a radiation

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:90%
problem in the terminal.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I did visit Round Hill,
well, in the early days,

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.800 align:middle line:84%
when it was first being turned,
on a weekend once or twice.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And on one of these
occasions, I believe

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I might have been the first
one to be in the terminal

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:90%
when it was energized.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It happened late at night,
about 10 or 11 o'clock,

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:90%
in this dark blimp hangar.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was sent up armed with
a heavy ball-peen hammer

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.650 align:middle line:84%
to knock on the
aluminum sphere in case

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.910 align:middle line:84%
the paper belts showed any
tendency to run off the pulleys

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:90%
and tear.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And on this occasion,
they had succeeded

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.710 align:middle line:84%
in drying the belt sufficiently
so that it did develop voltage,

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and did carry charge
up to the terminal.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after
they started the belt,

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:84%
and then actuated
the corona system,

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:84%
a terrific spark-over
took place from the edge

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
of the two-foot opening
through which I had come

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:90%
to a roof rafter 20 feet away.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And since I experienced
no physiological reaction,

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I realized, which I hadn't
fully believed before,

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:84%
that Michael Faraday
had been right.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this guy was exposed
to 5 and 1/2 million volts,

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.560 align:middle line:90%
and nothing happened to him?

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Mhm.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:84%
He was saying Michael
Faraday was right.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you've heard of Faraday
paint, Faraday fabric,

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Faraday cages--

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Faraday cages, sure.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --these are
things that allow for no EMFs

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:90%
to go through it.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.310 align:middle line:90%
So he was protected in that way.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.430 align:middle line:84%
But fun fact about
him, John G. Trump,

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.112 align:middle line:90%
President Donald Trump's--

00:19:52.112 --> 00:19:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trump's uncle.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --uncle, who Trump
has spoken about in the past,

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.070 align:middle line:84%
he took over all of
Nikola Tesla's work

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.363 align:middle line:84%
one week after
Nikola Tesla died.

00:20:01.363 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This guy did?

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: This guy did.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:90%
And he took it to MIT.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.193 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I had heard
that Tesla's files were

00:20:06.193 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:90%
robbed by government.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yep.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he got them?

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.482 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: The
Defense Department one

00:20:10.482 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:84%
week later brought it and
dropped it on his table

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and said, can you see if
this can be weaponized?

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:84%
He looked through it
and he said, actually--

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and this isn't to say
anything about Nikola Tesla,

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
but he said he wasn't
that impressed,

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to improve
upon all the technology.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So he started working on
particle accelerators,

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:90%
like the one in CERN--

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --and generators
that we are now seeing today.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.405 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite interesting.

00:20:33.405 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
caught he said the corona

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:90%
system in there.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Because the corona,
a corona ejection is like--

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.655 align:middle line:84%
have you ever seen those things
where you put your thumb on it,

00:20:41.655 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and an electrode
starts zapping--

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Zzz, zzz.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --towards
your finger?

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Those plasma balls,
that's a corona ejection.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting
thing is this guy

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
took all of Nikola Tesla's
work and brought it

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.983 align:middle line:90%
to MIT, and then DOD, DARPA--

00:20:55.983 --> 00:20:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They all jumped in.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --Lincoln Labs,
they all started jumping in.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
newest things that

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:84%
wasn't directly from this,
but DOD and Lincoln Labs

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.938 align:middle line:84%
has started working on
advanced optics that is now

00:21:07.938 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:84%
in this telescope
that they're trying

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.020 align:middle line:84%
to build on top of Mauna Kea
in Hawaii, which is an eye.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
It's called an optical
eye, the best technology

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.755 align:middle line:84%
the world has ever seen
on the top of a mountain

00:21:19.755 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
going all the way down
to the tectonic plate.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:22.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest
mountain in the world.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So you think about
that, there's an eye

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.850 align:middle line:84%
on top of a pyramid
or a mountain,

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.558 align:middle line:84%
kind of like the Eye of Sauron
in "Lord of the Rings--"

00:21:29.558 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or what we see--

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: --all-seeing eye on--

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --on the back of a
bill or something like that.

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Exactly.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Is 5G technology going to be
beneficial, in your opinion,

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:90%
for humanity?

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes, I do.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:46.080 align:middle line:10%
We could have devices that
actually are beneficial,

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.170 align:middle line:10%
using frequencies that are
beneficial for the human

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:10%
organism, like a cat's
purr or a horse's heart

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.197 align:middle line:10%
is actually healthy
for our heart

00:21:55.197 --> 00:21:57.030 align:middle line:10%
even if we're standing
10 feet away from it.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or a pig's heart
or something like that.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.265 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, a horse's
heart, they've actually found,

00:22:01.265 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:84%
there's technology to show that
horses have such a strong heart

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.990 align:middle line:84%
field it extends 20
feet beyond their body.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a heart
problem in the way

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.620 align:middle line:84%
that it's, in a
sense, fluctuating,

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic field,
standing next to a horse

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.730 align:middle line:84%
can bring your heart
field back into coherence.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Just standing next to a horse.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Just
standing next to it.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's domesticated horses.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wish
I would have been

00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:26.190 align:middle line:90%
next to Secretariat in his day.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: With that huge heart?

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: That's right.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
incredible technology.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:90%
I love technology, Ben.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:90%
I think it's been beneficial--

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Me, too.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in the right hands.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:36.610 align:middle line:90%
I put that in quotes.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens
if 5G or 6G or 7G

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
gets in the hands
of the wrong people?

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, this is
the core reason why I also--

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I study the conventional
news and alternative news,

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and many people in
the alternative news,

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:84%
they think that it's
already in the wrong hands.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I believe that we have
sleeper cells, if you will,

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.800 align:middle line:84%
we have conscious
people in high places.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:84%
They just don't realize
what kind of battle

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:90%
we're actually in right now.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is you
can say whether you

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:90%
trust the elite or not.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Some people do.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know whether or not
to trust what a supercomputer

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.100 align:middle line:90%
thinks and does.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, the
surveillance state,

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:84%
it's not people deciding what
to do with all this data.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.030 align:middle line:90%
It's computers deciding.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And then it's people looking at
the data and saying thank you,

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:84%
computer, I'll take
your word for it,

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.963 align:middle line:84%
this is what's likely
going to happen.

00:23:30.963 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's going
to happen in two weeks?

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's let the
supercomputer check out

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.390 align:middle line:90%
probable outcomes.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, supercomputer.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
religion is coming back

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:90%
in the form of technology.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So we're building a god,
and we're listening to it

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:50.850 align:middle line:84%
as, you know, back in the
desert, Moses and his camp,

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.980 align:middle line:84%
they were listening to
the Lord in that way.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we're building
the scaffolding for a body

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.130 align:middle line:84%
for it to literally live in a
physical body on this world.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
technology is amazing, Ben.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could take a picture
of each other in this studio,

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.950 align:middle line:84%
beam it to anybody you want, and
they'd get it within seconds.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Text messaging instantly.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:14.130 align:middle line:84%
What will 5G do to
speeding that up even more?

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, yeah,
like in 4G world,

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:84%
we already have a world where
you can FaceTime somebody

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.570 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of
the planet in real time

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:90%
with high fidelity.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
This is going to amplify
that, but this is also

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.610 align:middle line:84%
what we need for
virtual reality,

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:84%
where you can actually be
at a concert with goggles

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:84%
on and that little headset on
and feel like you're actually

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think where we're starting
to head with this is technology

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.800 align:middle line:84%
is going to start recreating
simulated environments

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
in a different way
than "Westworld."

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So "Westworld" is, well, there's
no more Wild, Wild West, so

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:84%
let's build a world
where you go and you're

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.920 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with real world,
but also with computers.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, eventually, it's going to
be where you could be sitting

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.070 align:middle line:84%
in your seat, and you're
hooked up to a system,

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and you feel like
you're in that world.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.280 align:middle line:84%
You're smelling what they want
you to smell in that world.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing what
they want you to see.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And this could be done
wirelessly and remotely,

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.930 align:middle line:90%
not even invasively.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:15.170 align:middle line:84%
You may not even, in the future,
need to hook yourself up to it.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:90%
So do we trust that or not?

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Because then there could be
somebody sitting over here

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.740 align:middle line:84%
in this room that's
not actually there,

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:84%
but we think that
person is there.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
We could touch that
artificial person,

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and the stimuli will
go through our body,

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.110 align:middle line:84%
making us feel like
they are really there.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we opt
out of 5G, or are we

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:84%
going to be forced
into it as individuals?

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: In a
way, I don't even

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:84%
think we were able
to opt out of 4G.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:84%
You're walking through a
park or downtown Manhattan,

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:84%
everyone's got their
phones up to their ears,

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and there's a camera going
this way and a camera

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:48.470 align:middle line:90%
going that way.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:49.820 align:middle line:90%
There's people going like this.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:84%
There's cameras
aimed everywhere.

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.250 align:middle line:90%
There's microphones.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.400 align:middle line:84%
You weren't able to opt out
of it unless you ran off

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.470 align:middle line:84%
into the woods, where
there's no cell signal,

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.240 align:middle line:84%
or go into an
underground bunker.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:84%
5G, there's no opting out
because it's in the sky.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:90%
It's on every single building.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who has
a phone, there's

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:84%
beam-forming technology,
meaning it's not a beacon that

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.710 align:middle line:90%
goes out in every direction.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, with GPS, they can
triangulate your position

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:90%
within a few meters--

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Know exactly
where you are.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --and send a
specific frequency to you

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.913 align:middle line:84%
over there within
a few square feet.

00:26:23.913 --> 00:26:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
5G has the ability

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:90%
to bend space and time, Ben?

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think
it already is.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I think this technology
actually goes all the way back

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:84%
to the chronovisor in the early
1900s, which is this visor that

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.160 align:middle line:84%
allows you to see
future probabilities

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:90%
and see into past events.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:47.120 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think most people
even know what spacetime is.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what 5G
technology is now ushering us

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:53.870 align:middle line:84%
into is the ability for
us to realize that even

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:90%
the past is not set in stone.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.210 align:middle line:84%
The past can be augmented
because right now

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.110 align:middle line:90%
is all that exists.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:84%
In the past, there's
quantum residue

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.030 align:middle line:90%
that holds the memory in place.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But there's people who use
this chronovisor to view

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:84%
past events, but other
people who were present

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:84%
were seeing different
past events,

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:16.970 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's kind of
like quantum phenomena

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that, if you want to see the
wave collapse into a particle,

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.230 align:middle line:84%
you'll see it, but if you
want to see it stay as a wave

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.250 align:middle line:90%
you'll see that.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking about
here's my human hand.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.930 align:middle line:84%
You amplify it 10 billion
times, you get down

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.280 align:middle line:90%
to the atomic structure.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.020 align:middle line:84%
That behaves
according to physics.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.390 align:middle line:84%
You amplify it 1
trillion trillion times,

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:36.890 align:middle line:84%
it gets down to
the quantum level.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've changed it.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And quantum level, it goes
through retrograde motion.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't obey the
law of linear time.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't obey
the law of space,

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:84%
either, because entangled
particles across the universe

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:84%
can communicate with
each other in real time.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I think what it's doing is it's
teaching us that we actually

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.950 align:middle line:84%
have access to exactly
what all this technology is

00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:90%
doing in the first place.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like Star Trek's
teleportation device.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Are we moving toward
that kind of technology,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.743 align:middle line:84%
where we can move people and
objects anyplace we want?

00:28:07.743 --> 00:28:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I've
seen on your show

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.130 align:middle line:84%
before people talking
about stargates,

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:15.082 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
portals where--

00:28:15.082 --> 00:28:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: William Henry.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And they're religious in
nature because you also

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:84%
have to be oriented
in your consciousness

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.310 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be transported
in a healthy way.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Do we have the technology
operational right now?

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.390 align:middle line:90%
I can't say for sure.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:90%
But is that the next--

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.290 align:middle line:90%
is that going to be 6G, 7G?

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:90%
I think yes.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you going to go 5G?

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: We're
already there, and yes.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.400 align:middle line:84%
What my belief is, is that
there's no outrunning it,

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's rolling
out as we speak.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So like I said before,
instead of trying to beat it

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.760 align:middle line:84%
or trying to tear it down, I
think we need to transcend it.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.580 align:middle line:84%
We need to, in body and
mind, be a lot healthier

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:84%
so we're not affected
by the inflammation

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:90%
that the radio waves cause.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:84%
But then we need
to use it for art.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:84%
We need to use it
to wake people up.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.525 align:middle line:84%
And the infrastructure
is already here.

00:29:05.525 --> 00:29:06.650 align:middle line:90%
That's the beautiful thing.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:08.600 align:middle line:84%
They're building
the infrastructure

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.850 align:middle line:84%
for how we can awaken
people through art,

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.430 align:middle line:84%
but we are the ones who
need to make the content.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
We need to speak about things
in less of a scary way,

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and show the potential
benefits, rather than

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.220 align:middle line:84%
all the potential harms with
no mention of the solutions.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you think
the conspiracy theorists are

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.810 align:middle line:90%
so negative about 5G?

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:28.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
say they're wrong,

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.560 align:middle line:84%
but why are they so
negative about it?

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Mainly, I
think that's residue

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:36.620 align:middle line:84%
from this old paradigm,
because if we look back

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:84%
into the institutions
and the people who

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.170 align:middle line:84%
ran those institutions
that are actually

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:46.490 align:middle line:84%
building what 5G is today,
nobody can really trust that.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.380 align:middle line:84%
They've taken over our
educational system.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:52.730 align:middle line:84%
They've implanted TVs in
every single household.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:84%
We're being swarmed with
different kinds of media

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:90%
that changes the way we think.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Of course we don't trust them.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But I think we don't
have to trust them.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do
is realize that we're

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.400 align:middle line:84%
more powerful than them
and these little microwave

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.830 align:middle line:84%
radiation signals
that we're receiving.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:90%
We are more powerful.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:14.383 align:middle line:84%
But we will not be more
powerful until we wake up to it.

00:30:14.383 --> 00:30:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
that I think is

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.040 align:middle line:84%
going to inspire people to
step into their inner power

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:84%
is meditation and
art that brings us

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:84%
into this world
inside of us, where

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.520 align:middle line:84%
we realize we are the ones
that hold all the power.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, 5G, for giving us the
platform for our own awakening.

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:33.002 align:middle line:90%
That's what I say.

00:30:33.002 --> 00:30:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, the
study that you've

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.250 align:middle line:84%
kind of alluded to by the
Michigan Medicine team

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.380 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
natural occurring

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.670 align:middle line:84%
DMT in the human brain
or the mammal brain,

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:47.090 align:middle line:84%
for example, how
will 5G affect that?

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, I think
that study was really

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.840 align:middle line:84%
showing that there's this
speculation that we produce

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.677 align:middle line:84%
so little DMT, it
really shouldn't matter.

00:30:53.677 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was the study
that showed us, no, we're

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.640 align:middle line:84%
producing DMT all the time,
and it's always a part

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.070 align:middle line:90%
of the way we decode reality.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.000 align:middle line:84%
5G is bending the way
we decode reality.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.220 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, and a lot of
people fear it, but I think--

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it putting
us in another world?

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, I
think what it can

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.560 align:middle line:84%
do is it can cause for
different neurochemical ratios

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.100 align:middle line:84%
to just start naturally
cascading through your brain.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So it can make you
feel like you are

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:84%
in a different state
of consciousness,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and even perceiving
a different reality.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't think that it
can just turn on a DMT trip

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.840 align:middle line:84%
for people, but I do
think that we're actually

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.340 align:middle line:90%
leading in that direction.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And 5G, it's already
studying the human.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.695 align:middle line:84%
It's studying not
just our behavior,

00:31:38.695 --> 00:31:40.660 align:middle line:90%
but it's studying our neurology.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It's taking all the data
that's been done after studying

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.670 align:middle line:90%
neurology for decades now.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's getting to the
point where it understands

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.640 align:middle line:90%
how we operate biologically.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And if it wants
to, in the future,

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.230 align:middle line:84%
it can find what
kind of frequency

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:59.140 align:middle line:84%
do we need to send
to George in order

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:90%
to turn on or turn off DMT.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.490 align:middle line:90%
How do we turn off serotonin?

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.110 align:middle line:84%
How do we make him
feel depressed,

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:06.880 align:middle line:84%
or how do we bring
him out of depression?

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.312 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're saying
they can control my reality.

00:32:10.312 --> 00:32:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Perceived reality.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where I think
the conscious revolution needs

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.330 align:middle line:84%
to actually start
stepping up its game.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.460 align:middle line:84%
If we thought that
consciousness and awakening

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.160 align:middle line:84%
consciousness was a
great idea 10 years ago,

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.910 align:middle line:90%
today it's a necessity.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:27.610 align:middle line:84%
What it's going to be able to
do is alter the physical reality

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.080 align:middle line:90%
and the vibrational reality.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But there is a part of
reality that sits in a vacuum.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.420 align:middle line:90%
And we find this in meditation.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.680 align:middle line:84%
It's that stillness
we hear about.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think more
people need to learn

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.320 align:middle line:84%
how to be in that stillness
and be in their center

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:84%
while engaging with the outer
world, while walking around,

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.390 align:middle line:90%
not just in seated meditation.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:49.060 align:middle line:84%
But I think all those
older spiritual traditions

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.440 align:middle line:90%
are now more needed than ever.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think the utopian
world, aside from that,

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:58.060 align:middle line:84%
is computers figuring
out how to allow

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.630 align:middle line:84%
us to awaken the consciousness
more rapidly than, let's

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.370 align:middle line:90%
say, the Buddha had to.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.370 align:middle line:84%
All those sages who
needed to spend decades

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.860 align:middle line:84%
in a cave in meditation,
we need to learn

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:84%
how to do this and come into
our center in the coming weeks

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and months in order
to start staving off

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.400 align:middle line:84%
the rapid increase
in radio waves,

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and also the intelligence
that's the surveillance state.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there going to be
a camera at every 500-foot box

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.182 align:middle line:90%
that you talked about?

00:33:26.182 --> 00:33:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Potentially.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.223 align:middle line:84%
But I don't even think
there needs to be a camera.

00:33:29.223 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I actually think cameras
are going to start--

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.380 align:middle line:90%
that's going to be--

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Passe?

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yeah, because what
5G is going to be able to do,

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.958 align:middle line:84%
you know already
in airports, you go

00:33:37.958 --> 00:33:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to get
that millimeter wave.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.730 align:middle line:84%
The same wavelength where
it sends millimeter waves

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:45.400 align:middle line:84%
through your body and it can
tell if you're hiding something

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.730 align:middle line:84%
even under your skin, all these
little boxes that are being put

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.770 align:middle line:84%
up are basically
cameras, but they're

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:90%
visualizing things differently.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Wuhan, China,
there's a rollout

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.760 align:middle line:84%
of these helmets that
are given to cops.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.788 align:middle line:84%
Now, these cops
have a visor where

00:34:00.788 --> 00:34:02.330 align:middle line:84%
they can look at
people on the street

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and they could see,
oh, well that's Joe,

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.500 align:middle line:90%
that's Jane, that's whatever.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I can tell because
their digital ID.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
a little television

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.960 align:middle line:90%
screen in front of them.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It is.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.239 align:middle line:90%
And it augments reality.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.370 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't replace it.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:84%
It shows, oh, well, I see
this person walking down.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:90%
And I can see who it is.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I know like what
their bank account is.

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.242 align:middle line:90%
I know how much--

00:34:21.242 --> 00:34:22.909 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've got
a low credit score.

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Right, I
know their credit score,

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.142 align:middle line:84%
if they have warrants
out for their arrest.

00:34:26.142 --> 00:34:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
small-time things.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.407 align:middle line:84%
They also, right now in
China, they have infrared.

00:34:32.407 --> 00:34:34.699 align:middle line:84%
So they can tell if somebody
is walking down the street

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:37.219 align:middle line:90%
and has a fever from a virus.

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:39.650 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
where could this go?

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Could they tell, oh, this person
hasn't had their vaccines yet,

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and they can go
up and say, I can

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.040 align:middle line:84%
tell you haven't
had your vaccine,

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.000 align:middle line:90%
you need to come with me--

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or you're arrested.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.949 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:51.560 align:middle line:84%
You haven't had your vaccine,
or, oh, you have this kind of

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:51.830 align:middle line:90%
genotype--

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.247 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
Orwellian, isn't it?

00:34:53.247 --> 00:34:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It's very Orwellian.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.600 align:middle line:90%
And nobody even knows--

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.440 align:middle line:84%
the idea of Orwell, when people
started reading about that,

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.317 align:middle line:84%
was, again, it was
human intelligence.

00:35:02.317 --> 00:35:04.400 align:middle line:84%
We're not dealing with
human intelligence anymore.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.490 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with a
disembodied intelligence,

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:84%
where any device is as
smart as a quantum computer.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Whereas we're as
smart as humans,

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.200 align:middle line:84%
mosquitoes are as
smart as mosquitoes,

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.630 align:middle line:84%
dogs are as smart as
dogs, in this world,

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.570 align:middle line:84%
you could have something that
looks exactly like a dog,

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.730 align:middle line:84%
but it's as smart as
a quantum computer.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.530 align:middle line:90%
It knows your digital ID.

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And let's say if you
wanted to send something

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:84%
to go in and neutralize
or kill and assassinate

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.740 align:middle line:84%
some kind of leader, you
don't send in a human,

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.020 align:middle line:84%
you send in something
microscopic that

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.600 align:middle line:84%
gets inside their body,
replicates, replicates,

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.590 align:middle line:90%
and takes them over.

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of world
that is very, very possible.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.483 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
100 years from now.

00:35:47.483 --> 00:35:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're talking now.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.858 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I'm talking it's
already being rolled out.

00:35:50.858 --> 00:35:53.360 align:middle line:84%
We already have
mosquito-sized drones.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.310 align:middle line:84%
We already have
gnat-sized drones.

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.260 align:middle line:84%
We could potentially
build something

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:84%
the size of a mountain, with
time, that has far more power.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that is what
we're actually building,

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.560 align:middle line:84%
is eventually there's going
to be things far bigger

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.200 align:middle line:84%
than us that we are just
going to have to bow down

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to because we don't know how
to contend with something

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that intelligent,
something that powerful.

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's why right
now, not tomorrow, people

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.450 align:middle line:84%
need to start
working on themselves

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and working on how
we are going to wake

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.910 align:middle line:84%
up to this being a
threat now, but how

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:29.000 align:middle line:84%
do we turn it inside
out into our salvation.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to be they,
it's not going to be the elite,

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's probably not going
to be the computers themselves

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.990 align:middle line:90%
that do it.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:37.010 align:middle line:90%
We need to do it.

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this technology
scare you or enlighten you?

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: You know, I
strangely get inspired

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:46.520 align:middle line:90%
when I see world events.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Like a global quarantine,
a global lockdown,

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.770 align:middle line:84%
nothing like that seems to scare
me because I see everything

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:56.340 align:middle line:90%
as opportunity for growth.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yeah, because
I could die tomorrow.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Who really knows.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:84%
There could be an accident,
and I could die tomorrow.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Or, I could live a nice,
long, healthy life.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.190 align:middle line:84%
The outer world,
I get to witness

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:84%
it going through this
rapid transformation.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether I
think it's good, benevolent,

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:16.820 align:middle line:90%
bad, maleficent.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.010 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what I think.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.560 align:middle line:84%
What matters is it's
giving me an opportunity

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.920 align:middle line:84%
to transcend my old level of
consciousness into a new level.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So like I said
before, I think we

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:29.570 align:middle line:90%
need to thank what's happening.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean just,
oh, thank it and ignore it.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.340 align:middle line:84%
We need to thank it and
get more involved with it.

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.700 align:middle line:84%
We need to engage
with this world more

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.782 align:middle line:84%
because 99% of the population
knows 1% of what's going on

00:37:41.782 --> 00:37:42.740 align:middle line:90%
in the world right now.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens,
and what happened

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:90%
to when life was simpler?

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: What
happened to that.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We didn't
have cell phones.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.200 align:middle line:90%
We got by.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.550 align:middle line:90%
We had certain things.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.230 align:middle line:90%
We got by.

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't life simpler then, Ben?

00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably even
before you were born.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.650 align:middle line:90%
And I believe it was, in a way.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I kind of have this
romantic idea of I

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:07.510 align:middle line:84%
wish we could go back
5,000, 10,000 years ago,

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.220 align:middle line:90%
before any kind of technology--

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't want
to go back that far.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: No?

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know--

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I still want my radio.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.570 align:middle line:90%
I actually love having a phone.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:19.900 align:middle line:84%
I love having the
internet at my disposal.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.500 align:middle line:84%
If I have any inkling that
I want to learn something,

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.225 align:middle line:84%
I can learn it within seconds,
whereas 500 years ago--

00:38:26.225 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's true.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:28.900 align:middle line:90%
You can get instant answers.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my producer, Tom,
uses Voice all the time.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And anytime I have a
question about something,

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.600 align:middle line:84%
he's on it like
instantly into his phone.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, tell me, how
many years, da-da-da-da-da.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And it spits back an answer.

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You couldn't have
done that 15 years ago.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: No.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And what's really happening
is time is accelerating,

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.690 align:middle line:84%
or what we perceive as
time is accelerating.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So whereas it took hundreds
of thousands of years

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to build these simple
tools, utter words,

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.280 align:middle line:84%
mark them on caves, put
them into languages,

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.560 align:middle line:84%
start sharing the
languages, getting people

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.660 align:middle line:84%
to think more in terms
of language, then

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.160 align:middle line:84%
eventually start the printing
press so we can put it out

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.280 align:middle line:84%
there more, then eventually
start building technology where

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.560 align:middle line:84%
we can start talking to
people across the globe,

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:19.090 align:middle line:84%
now sharing our faces,
time is accelerating.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.070 align:middle line:84%
We've always been moving
in this direction,

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.020 align:middle line:84%
ever since the first
word was ever spoken.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, we're there now.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:28.668 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this evolutionary
leap great for humanity?

00:39:28.668 --> 00:39:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I think it is.

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, it's going to
make intelligent kids, right?

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Our kids
today, I mean, I

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:36.040 align:middle line:84%
have a four-year-old
daughter that

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.260 align:middle line:84%
can already use
an iPad almost as

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.237 align:middle line:90%
well as I could use technology.

00:39:40.237 --> 00:39:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And play games
and everything else.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Mhm.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And they just pick
it up like a sponge.

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:49.330 align:middle line:10%
So really, if we can get past
some of the health risks of it

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.850 align:middle line:10%
and start to minimize
that, maybe even tweak it

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:54.670 align:middle line:10%
to where it's actually
benefiting our health,

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:10%
then I think we're
going to start

00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:10%
waking up to exponential
leaps in what we

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.750 align:middle line:10%
can do with technology.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think
we're going to continue

00:40:03.625 --> 00:40:04.890 align:middle line:90%
to progress as a human.

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I do.

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think the future human is
going to probably not resemble

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.550 align:middle line:84%
current humans anymore because
we're going to start being--

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:15.190 align:middle line:84%
we may resemble
it, but in a sense,

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.380 align:middle line:84%
we're already fusing
with technology.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.640 align:middle line:84%
There's already these talk
of RFID chips implanted

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.910 align:middle line:84%
into our body, nanotechnology
that goes into your body.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:26.440 align:middle line:90%
People have false hips.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, this technology
is already here.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But imagine it with
four or five generations

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.550 align:middle line:90%
beyond where it's at now.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be exciting.

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.300 align:middle line:90%
It could also be devastating.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.427 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Need to be careful.

00:40:39.427 --> 00:40:41.770 align:middle line:10%
Ben, how do people track
you and get ahold of you?

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.350 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: Go to
benjosephstewart.com.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:49.720 align:middle line:10%
And I'm basically-- my show
"Limitless" is on Gaia,

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.610 align:middle line:10%
and I'm speaking
about human potential.

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:53.780 align:middle line:10%
And I do speak about
technology there.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you
can get ahold of me.

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And I would encourage
everybody who

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:84%
wants to know what's
happening with 5G,

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.763 align:middle line:84%
is our conscious awakening,
please get in touch with me.

00:41:02.763 --> 00:41:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
maybe the next time

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.670 align:middle line:84%
you're on "Belief" we'll
be talking about 7 or 8G.

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:07.767 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: That's right.

00:41:07.767 --> 00:41:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God knows what'll
be happening then, huh?

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:11.007 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I can't wait.

00:41:11.007 --> 00:41:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's
an honor, George.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing,
5G technology.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.030 align:middle line:10%
But there are a lot
of people out there

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:22.330 align:middle line:10%
that are petrified of
this kind of technology.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.040 align:middle line:10%
Let's hope they're wrong.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
