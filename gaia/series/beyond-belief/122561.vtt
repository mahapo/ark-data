00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.700 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.150 align:middle line:10%
Boy, I'm really looking
forward to this program,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:10%
because we are diving
into the paranormal

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:10%
with a paranormal podcaster.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:90%
His name is Jim Harold.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:10%
>>Jim Harold explores the
world of the paranormal

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:10%
through his flagship podcasts,
"Campfire" and "The Paranormal

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:10%
Podcast."

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:10%
They are so popular,
fans have downloaded them

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.100 align:middle line:10%
nearly 20 million times.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:10%
Jim also writes the book
series "Campfire-- True Ghost

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.640 align:middle line:10%
Stories."

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Jim knows when it comes
to life and death,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
truth is stranger than fiction--
today, on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was a neat
introduction, Mr. Harold.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:10%
>>JIM HAROLD: Hey, I'm so glad
to be here-- honor, real honor.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Paranormal podcaster.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yes.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What exactly is that?

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Now, we know about podcast.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Right.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you deal
exclusively with that?

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yeah.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.625 align:middle line:10%
I started back in 2005, when
nobody knew what a podcast was.

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: What people would
say is, "a what cast?"

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:10%
And when I named it-- and it
really was a stroke of luck.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the sharpest
tool in the drawer.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.125 align:middle line:84%
But I thought,
OK, it's a podcast

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:28.375 align:middle line:90%
and it's about the paranormal.

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:30.055 align:middle line:84%
It's a podcast
about-- oh, I'll call

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:31.720 align:middle line:90%
it "The Paranomal Podcast."

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: And the
funny thing is,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:84%
nobody else had the name back in
2005, and that helped me a lot.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And I've been fascinated
by this going back

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:84%
to Leonard Nimoy in the
1970s with "In Search Of"

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.780 align:middle line:90%
when I was a little kid.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.576 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Always
loved this stuff,

00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and when I decided to start
podcasting 11 years ago now,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, this
is what I want to do.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm fascinated by people like
you who did it for so long

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:90%
on the radio.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:90%
So we'll give it a shot.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's turned into a
career, lo and behold.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what's exciting,
when you can turn into what you

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:90%
love--

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Oh, yeah.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --into a career,
and mesh them together,

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:06.875 align:middle line:90%
it's perfect.

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: I'm blessed.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:90%
I'm blessed.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm blessed to be
here today with you.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You put together
the "Campfire" series--

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
several books that
you've got out.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.697 align:middle line:84%
You constantly
keep writing books.

00:02:15.697 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a little bit about that.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.245 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Well, in 2009, I
started the "Campfire" podcast.

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:84%
I actually did a little
special on my normal podcast

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and had people from
all over the world

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.659 align:middle line:90%
call in and tell their stories.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it would
be a one time thing.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:90%
It'll be a fun thing.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was amazed
at the reaction.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.320 align:middle line:84%
People love to
tell their stories.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.786 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Whether
they're ghost stories,

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:40.029 align:middle line:84%
UFOs stories, Bigfoot
stories, wherever--

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:90%
people love to tell them.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a story.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So I said, aha, this
is another podcast.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So it became "Jim
Harold's Campfire."

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.454 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to one of my
author friends, Annie Wilder.

00:02:52.454 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
know, you've got

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:90%
a lot of great ghost stories.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:84%
You ought to start
writing books.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's
a pretty good idea.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:90%
So we started.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Fourth one is out,
working on a fifth.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: So it's very exciting.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: People
love the mysteries.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:90%
They love the paranormal.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.115 align:middle line:90%
And they love to get scared.

00:03:12.115 --> 00:03:12.915 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:18.724 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.724 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>I think one of the
great things about horror

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
is they really reflect what
the fear of the moment is.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Everybody in the
world is afraid.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.590 align:middle line:84%
We're all afraid of the
same things together.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.615 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a safe fright
when you're in a movie.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think that enables
you to sort of relish

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.540 align:middle line:84%
it and sort of enjoy
or look into yourself

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and say, why am I
frightened, afraid of it?

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Jim, a
little clip there of people

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:84%
being afraid of zombies
and things like that.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Yet, they want to be
scared at the same time.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Why do people want to
be scared, and then

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:90%
they run away from this?

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Well, I think there's
the thrill aspect of it.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, like we love
to ride roller coasters.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
We like to be scared,
yet kind of annoying

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:90%
that we're safe, really.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.540 align:middle line:84%
But I also think there
is the component that it

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:90%
taps into something deeper.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.470 align:middle line:90%
I know you do.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:90%
And I do--

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: --believe
that there's something

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:90%
to this paranormal stuff.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
What it is exactly,
I don't know.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:84%
But I think that part of
the reason we love stories

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.960 align:middle line:84%
of the unexplained is because
it speaks to a universal truth.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
wrapped in there,

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
along with the
entertainment value.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may not
be able to explain,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I may not be able to explain,
exactly what's going on.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:90%
But there's something to it.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.100 align:middle line:84%
There's something
to life after death.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:84%
There's something to
the UFO phenomenon.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's just
something out there

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
that is happening that some
people can't explain too well.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
You've done a good job
trying to explain that.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Well, I try.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.130 align:middle line:84%
But again, you
know, I often say,

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.064 align:middle line:84%
when I started these
podcasts back in 2005,

00:05:04.064 --> 00:05:05.230 align:middle line:90%
I thought, this'll be great.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:90%
I'll do this.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.825 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk to people
like Stanton Friedman

00:05:07.825 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and Brad Steiger and all
these great ghost hunters.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And about after six
months or a year,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll have all the answers.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, as you know, the more
people you talk to, many times,

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
you have more
questions than answers.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you really do.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Have you been
scared yourself on you any

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:84%
of your works,
investigations, research?

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.234 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Well, mainly what I
do are these programs and books.

00:05:33.234 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:10%
And I wouldn't call myself
paranormal investigator per se.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.010 align:middle line:84%
You don't go out
hunting for this.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: No.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of compare it to
a sportscaster and somebody

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:90%
that play sports.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think you can
be a good sportscaster

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:90%
and not be an athlete.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're the reporter.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: I'm the reporter.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.480 align:middle line:90%
But I have been scared?

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:84%
People have chilled me
with some of their tales.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.825 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that when
I look at these people,

00:05:54.825 --> 00:05:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I try to select, particularly
for the book, stories where

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:90%
people seem very, very sincere.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, some of
them have chilled me.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people say, how
do you sleep at night?

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:84%
You talk about this
stuff constantly.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem to
bother me, because I

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:84%
think that the spirit that
you approach this stuff in

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And I try to approach
it in a good spirit.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.739 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to conjure up
demons or anything like that.

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:20.155 align:middle line:84%
So I think as long
as I give out--

00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not evil.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.325 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: I don't think so.

00:06:22.325 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: No, I don't either.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:10%
Is there a subject
you won't touch?

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.709 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: I'm very hesitant to
touch the subject of satanism.

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Many of my new age friends-- and
god love them-- I talk to them,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and they say, well,
Jim, you know-- I say,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:84%
isn't there something
evil in the world?

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:84%
You look at Hitler and you
look at John Wayne Gacy.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Is there evil in the world?

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And they say, no,
Jim, there's not evil.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
There's just a different
level of spiritual evolution.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:90%
I believe there's evil.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's
evil in the world.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So something for
me is that you have

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
to be careful of that and
not kind of call that in.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
some various aspects

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
of things that you have
covered as a reporter,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:90%
as a podcast reporter.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
There is one area called
the Roadhouse Saloon.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at a
little video clip,

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:84%
then we'll come back
and talk about it.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>I've had many things happen
to me, many paranormal things.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in a haunted house.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I've had many
experiences with ghosts.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:90%
And I can always sense ghosts.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.124 align:middle line:84%
I can feel-- my
friends have me come

00:07:33.124 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and check out their new
apartments to read it,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:84%
to see if there's
something there,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:90%
if it's something negative.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.870 align:middle line:90%
And I can tell right away.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:90%
And this place, no hint.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I had no-- none of
the red flags went up.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:84%
None of the eerie
feelings went up.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.462 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- it was
very, very strange.

00:07:54.462 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So tell us about
the Roadhouse Saloon.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.667 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:07:57.667 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Up in Wisconsin.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.700 align:middle line:84%
That was actually
TI you saw there

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:90%
on the clip from Michigan.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And she was up in Wisconsin
with a friend of hers.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:90%
They had gone to see a band.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And they closed the place down,
talked to the band afterwards.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.950 align:middle line:90%
It was in kind of a rural area.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:84%
They were about an hour way
from where they emanated from.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And she was driving
home with her friend.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Her friend's name was Bob.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And the call of
nature came upon her.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.690 align:middle line:84%
But there was nowhere
to answer the call.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.404 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, it's 3
o'clock in the morning.

00:08:26.404 --> 00:08:27.320 align:middle line:90%
They're driving along.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And like an oasis, there's
the Roadhouse Saloon.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:90%
It was neon.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's open.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:10%
And there's cars in the park.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Must have
a restroom, right?

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Yeah.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You would hope.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.603 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: She goes in.

00:08:36.603 --> 00:08:37.403 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:08:37.403 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:90%
They go in.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Bob orders a couple of beers.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.549 align:middle line:10%
She goes to the
restroom, comes back.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.134 align:middle line:84%
And Bob says, oh,
this is so great.

00:08:44.134 --> 00:08:45.300 align:middle line:90%
I've heard about this place.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:90%
I've never been here.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a neat
mural on the wall.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And when they came in,
everybody was very welcoming.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.430 align:middle line:84%
There was probably about
a dozen people there.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:90%
They said, come on in.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
probably all vampires.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Well, possibly.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:90%
Listen to this.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they start
looking at the mural.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.755 align:middle line:84%
And they notice that the people
who are physically in the bar

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:09.183 align:middle line:84%
are depicted in
this old west mural.

[IMITATES "THE TWILIGHT ZONE"
 THEME SONG]

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: In fact, TI said
that-- hummed "The Twilight

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Zone" thing.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, it gets more bizarre.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:84%
There's an old, beautiful
jukebox with 45s in it,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:84%
if anybody out there
remembers those.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, are these
people staring at them?

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Yeah, they're kind
of looking at them weird.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:84%
A strange guy puts on Chubby
Checker, "Let's Twist Again."

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:84%
He walks up to TI, and says,
would you like to dance?

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.905 align:middle line:84%
She has canes, so she
shows him the canes,

00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and kind of begs
off, and said, she

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:84%
was really glad, because he
had these brown, nasty teeth.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's very weird, a
very surreal real kind

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:90%
of feel to it.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they start to
notice this old west motif.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a pair of
swinging doors.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
You probably remember
from the old TV westerns.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.511 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like the old canteens.

00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's two figures almost
developing into this mural,

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:90%
like a Polaroid picture.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But you can't quite
make them out.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
One figure is taller
than the other.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.900 align:middle line:10%
And they keep looking
at the figure,

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:10%
and it's like developing
in front of their eyes.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:10%
And one is a tall man.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:10%
And then there's a woman with
a skirt and boots and canes.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like her.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.700 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Like TI's canes.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:10%
And they realize they're
developing into this picture.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
They look at each other said,
let's get the heck out of here.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they start
to exit, and everybody

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.380 align:middle line:90%
keeps beckoning them back.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:90%
Come back, come back.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.240 align:middle line:84%
She says, they walked out of
the, door closed the door,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.020 align:middle line:90%
the place went stone cold quiet.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
The lights were all out,
like it had never been open.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:90%
No other cars in parking lot.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: So they
speed out, and they're

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
like, what the
heck is this about?

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's get out of here.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: So TI says, I've
got to figure this out.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.823 align:middle line:84%
And she's got a lot
more guts than me,

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:84%
because I would never
go back, George, never.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, a couple days
later, during the daylight,

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.350 align:middle line:90%
I might add--

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She got curious, right?

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.953 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: She got curious.

00:11:03.953 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So her, and I think it
was her sister, went back.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
woman behind the bar.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And it looked pretty
much the same.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
She did notice that the
jukebox was a CD jukebox

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't have
Chubby Checker on it.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And she asked the
lady behind the bar,

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.300 align:middle line:84%
she said, you know, we
were here the other night.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.739 align:middle line:84%
Where's the big strapping
bartender, young, good

00:11:24.739 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:90%
looking guy you had back there?

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said, there's no
bartender like that here

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.200 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The only ones here is my father,
who's an older gentleman,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:90%
and myself.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.184 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, TI and Bob kind of
got into some kind of portal--

00:11:38.184 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A different
world or something.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: And who knows?

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they would still
be there had they not

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.042 align:middle line:90%
had the good sense to get out.

00:11:45.042 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder what those
people wanted with them?

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: I don't know.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they wanted them to be
a part of the mural and part

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.895 align:middle line:10%
of their strange world.

00:11:51.895 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now, was the
picture still up there?

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Did she say?

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.018 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: The picture
was still up there.

00:11:56.018 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
But the two figures in
the doorway were gone.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.155 align:middle line:10%
So Bob and TI had gotten free.

00:12:04.155 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how to
explain it, George.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's freaky.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.378 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: I don't know
how to explain it.

00:12:08.378 --> 00:12:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And it really seems
like a "Twilight Zone"

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.720 align:middle line:84%
episode or the "Night
Gallery" or something.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
But when I select these
stories for the books,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I really try to focus
on those stories that

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:90%
seem the most sincere to me.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.712 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that TI
is telling the truth

00:12:23.712 --> 00:12:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and this happened
to her, because I

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.410 align:middle line:84%
do believe universe is
a very strange place,

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and that things happen that
just fall out of categories.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:84%
We can't put this in
a category of a ghost

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it might
be-- just weird,

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.537 align:middle line:84%
odd things-- head
scratchers, I call them.

00:12:40.537 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:84%
We're with Jim Harold,
a paranormal podcaster.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a story you've
covered about something

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:90%
called the English nurse.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Oh, yea.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.044 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: This was
from Dave in the UK.

00:12:52.044 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And I love the fact
that we have listeners

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:84%
from all over-- Japan,
the UK, Australia.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And Dave says that
his girlfriend's

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:84%
family-- her name's
Paula-- is very spooky.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:90%
They're into psychics.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:90%
They kind of see things.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:90%
They sense things.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that there
are people like that.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm about as
sensitive as a board.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: But there
are people, I believe.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this story
surrounds around Paula's mom.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:84%
She was in the National Health,
the hospital, for a procedure.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And it was late at night.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And this nurse
comes in and said,

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:90%
would you like a spot of tea?

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:90%
And she said, sure.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:90%
I'll take some tea.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And she was waiting
for the tea, and she

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
was like, something was
off about that nurse.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.805 align:middle line:90%
But I can't quite place it.

00:13:38.805 --> 00:13:40.054 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Put her finger on it.

00:13:40.054 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.437 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: And it took
her about an hour

00:13:43.437 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:90%
to come back with the tea.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.170 align:middle line:90%
And then it hit her.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:10%
The nurse was wearing an
old time nurse's uniform--

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.950 align:middle line:10%
like a hat and a smock,
something probably

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:10%
you would see in
"Downton Abbey" times.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: And she
gave her the tea.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And she asked the nurse,
hey, what's with the get up?

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.260 align:middle line:90%
What's with the costume?

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And the nurse just
smiled and walked away.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.664 align:middle line:84%
So a little time went on,
and she inquired with--

00:14:09.664 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wouldn't
drink the tea.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.980 align:middle line:90%
[HAROLD LAUGHING]

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.146 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: I think she drank
the tea and it was fine.

00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:90%
But they acquired.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.975 align:middle line:84%
And there was no nurse on duty
wearing anything like that

00:14:18.975 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:84%
or matched the
physical description.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So Paula's mom got to thinking,
I've got to figure this out.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So she had a psychic after she
was out of the hospital consult

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.640 align:middle line:84%
with her, and asked her
about-- asked him about this.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I'm getting
the name Lily in my mind.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.790 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Next time she went
back to that hospital,

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
she didn't say the
name or anything,

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.453 align:middle line:84%
but she just asked one
of the staff members.

00:14:45.453 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Hey, I was here last time.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:84%
There was this nurse in
this old time uniform.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.930 align:middle line:90%
She came to give me this tea.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.350 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't figure out.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of weird.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:10%
And the staff
member said, oh, you

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.236 align:middle line:10%
must have met our
resident ghost, Lily.

00:15:00.236 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, they
know about her.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Lily.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:10%
Our resident ghost, Lily
and the thing is that Dave,

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.660 align:middle line:10%
the son-in-law who told
me this story, said,

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.236 align:middle line:10%
she should have at least asked
for a latte or something if it

00:15:13.236 --> 00:15:13.395 align:middle line:10%
was--

00:15:13.395 --> 00:15:13.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: But I mean,
these things happen.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.010 align:middle line:90%
I believe these things happen.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:90%
I believe ghosts are real.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Whether you think
it's the stone tape

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:84%
theory, just kind of a replay,
or something more sentient

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
that interacts, I
believe it's real.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:84%
I've heard stories
of patients who

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:84%
have died that people
see in a hospital room.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.990 align:middle line:90%
They died in a hospital.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Oh.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're seen
wandering the hallway

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Oh, I've got a
great story about that.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:90%
May I share it?

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: I didn't even
think about this one.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:90%
There was a doctor.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And this was in the
United Kingdom, as well.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was in kind of
their emergency ward.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:84%
He was down at like a lower
level of the hospital.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And he got called
up for a code blue.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.913 align:middle line:84%
Somebody was having a
full cardiac arrest on one

00:15:56.913 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:90%
of the upper floors.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And he started to go
up the floors, OK?

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And he sees this
patient, a gentleman.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle line:84%
He's got, I think,
a green t-shirt on.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And he's naked from
the waist down.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And this doctor-- I believe
his name was Farbad--

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
he's trying to get upstairs to
help whoever this patient was.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:90%
This other patient.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Right.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: So he opens the doors
to the wards and calls out,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:90%
you have a person here.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.936 align:middle line:90%
You have to help them.

00:16:23.936 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:10%
Because he was
thinking, maybe it

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:10%
was an older patient with
dementia or something

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wandering around nude.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:29.890 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Exactly.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, he goes up
a couple more floors,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.700 align:middle line:10%
goes into the room, all
the staff members re there.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:90%
The patient is on the bed.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And his jaw drops,
because guess who it is?

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's that guy.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: It's that guy.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: And the guy died.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He died.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: So was that his soul?

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And again, George,
this is something

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:84%
that I love-- when
you get somebody

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:84%
who was a man of science,
like Dr. Farbad, and he says,

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not given to crazy
stuff, out there stuff.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm a man of science.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:00.940 align:middle line:90%
I believe in science.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.825 align:middle line:84%
But all I can tell you,
Jim, is this happened.

00:17:03.825 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And those are the kind of
people I love talking to.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.662 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: And it
happens all the time.

00:17:07.662 --> 00:17:10.234 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody watching
our program tonight-- Yep.

00:17:10.234 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --they have gone
through some kind of experience

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:13.409 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:17:13.409 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I remember a phone call
from a police officer

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
who said that they had
a call that somebody

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:19.960 align:middle line:90%
was dying of a heart attack.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.849 align:middle line:84%
Well, they got there
before the EMT did.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And so they come to the
door, they knock on the door.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Old man opens the door
for them, lets them in.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.860 align:middle line:84%
They see someone lying on
their face on the floor.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.550 align:middle line:84%
That's where they had
passed out died, I guess.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They roll him over, and
it's the old man who

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:90%
opened the door to let them.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.977 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: And I don't
believe all these people are

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.160 align:middle line:90%
lying, George.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I don't either.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a conviction
in their voice--

>>NOORY: I've had some
bad episodes with them.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:90%
There's something about them.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.320 align:middle line:84%
You've looked at them through
your paranormal podcasts.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: I'm with you.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know there are people
like Karen Dahlman and Rosemary

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Ellen--

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Karen loves them.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.346 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Rosemary
Ellen Guiley tells me

00:18:09.346 --> 00:18:10.690 align:middle line:90%
that they're just a tool.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And I love Rosemary.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:84%
She's fantastic, as you
know, having worked with her.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But this thing is that to
me, it's like an instrument.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:90%
It's like a chainsaw.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are people very
skilled with a chainsaw who

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.124 align:middle line:90%
can make beautiful carvings.

00:18:27.124 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
We see people make
carvings out of a chainsaw.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wouldn't want
to be next to somebody

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:90%
with a chainsaw.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.453 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: But you
wouldn't want to put

00:18:32.453 --> 00:18:33.675 align:middle line:10%
that chainsaw in my hand.

00:18:33.675 --> 00:18:35.550 align:middle line:10%
And that's the way I
feel about Ouija boards.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:10%
I think many times that they're
put in the hands of people

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:10%
who are just playing a game.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that--
one of my callers,

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I thought they had a
great kind of description.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Spiritually speaking, it's
like wearing your best clothes,

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.380 align:middle line:84%
your finest jewelry,
all decked out,

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:84%
walking in the worst
possible part of town

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
at 3:30 AM in the
morning, down the street

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:84%
waiting for something
to spiritually mug you.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.893 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: That's what I think,
because I think a lot of times,

00:19:05.893 --> 00:19:09.720 align:middle line:84%
when people have, let's say,
Aunt Millie contact them,

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.552 align:middle line:84%
I think that could very
well be an impostor spirit,

00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:90%
something that's latched on--

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That could be.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.325 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: --and
said, well, we're

00:19:14.325 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:10%

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.598 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That could be.

00:19:16.598 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Or they want something.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yeah.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an expert.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.980 align:middle line:10%
I just ask the
questions, and I've

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:10%
learned via the people who
I've spoken to over the years.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:10%
But I believe that
it's very dangerous

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:10%
to treat it as a game.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:10%
And just last week, I
had a caller who said,

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.030 align:middle line:10%
I had a great experience
with a Ouija board.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
We had this spirit,
and we would talk.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very kind
of nice relationship.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.355 align:middle line:84%
But he's got more
guts than I do.

00:19:40.355 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'll give
you an example.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I have a young lady
who had a Ouija board.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was in
one of the Carolinas.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And she was there with
a friend, teenagers.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.720 align:middle line:84%
They had candles
lit and so forth.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And they had one of
those old lava lamps,

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:90%
if you remember those.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've seen
those-- little--

00:19:56.345 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they said,
well, if you're real,

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:90%
you'll show us a sign.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So they looked over
at the lava lamp,

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and the gloopy stuff started to
kind of formulate and formulate

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:90%
and formulate.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.296 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like
a face, a face.

00:20:10.296 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:90%
What kind of face would that be?

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.777 align:middle line:10%
Then she said--

00:20:12.777 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In the lava lamp.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.985 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: In the lava lamp.

00:20:14.985 --> 00:20:19.090 align:middle line:10%
It formed into the face
of a snarling devil face.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, great.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: It snarled at them.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.180 align:middle line:10%
Then they shut the
board, and the gloop

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:10%
went back to those little
kind of gloopy-- like normal.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, anything that can
do that, George, I'm

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.042 align:middle line:10%
going to stay away from.

00:20:31.042 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:10%
I'll stick to Monopoly.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I don't blame you.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:10%
I don't blame you.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard about
haunted objects?

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
People will pick up
objects, bring them home,

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:90%
but they've been haunted.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And whatever has attached
itself to it stays.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yeah.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.348 align:middle line:90%
I've got a great example one.

00:20:46.348 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:84%
This one, when you
talk about things

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.760 align:middle line:84%
that scare me or something--
I've heard a lot of these,

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:90%
as I know you have.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.620 align:middle line:84%
So it takes something
a little extra

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:84%
to kind of put a
chill up the spine.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.310 align:middle line:90%
But this is one.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a young lady-- I think
was Amy from Montana, if I'm

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:90%
remembering correctly.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.980 align:middle line:84%
She was helping her aunt
clean out her house.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And her aunt came upon
this lamp-- pretty lamp

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:90%
of a flamenco dancer.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:90%
And it was very unique.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:90%
And it lit up.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was very rainbow
colored and ornate.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.329 align:middle line:84%
And she said, would
you like to have this?

00:21:19.329 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:90%
And she said, absolutely.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.630 align:middle line:90%
So she put it in her room.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Not a day or two later,
it was early morning,

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and Amy hears footsteps
down the hall.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, this wasn't uncommon,
because the thermostat

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
in their house was
right next to her door.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.750 align:middle line:90%
So she thought it was her mom.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So she hears them,
this footsteps.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:90%
And the footsteps stop.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:90%
And she says, Mom?

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Mom?

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Mom doesn't answer.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
All of the sudden, peaks
in the door-- the face

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:84%
in the figure of the face on
that lamp-- with an evil snarl.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
This continues to go on
and on and on, George,

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to where she said that
this thing would show up

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:90%
five to 10 minutes a night.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.210 align:middle line:10%
Then it got so bad that
the figure-- actually, she

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:10%
had a four poster bed--
the figure grabbed

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.310 align:middle line:10%
onto the posters of her
bed, and would lean over.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:10%
That's terrifying for
an adult. But a child--

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:10%

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:25.655 align:middle line:10%

>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: So anyway, she
told her parents finally.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Parents said, we'll
get rid of it.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And as far as she knew,
they got rid of it.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:90%
These incidents kept happening.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So one day, she
was outside playing

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:90%
with her sister or something.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:90%
And there was an old oil tank.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And behind the oil
tank lie the lamp.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:84%
These things are
still happening.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So they took the lamp,
and they threw it

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
in the trash-- no
more flamenco lady.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:90%
And here's the kicker.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:84%
This flamenco
lady, or the person

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.370 align:middle line:84%
who built this lamp, they
found out that actually, she

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:84%
had been arrested and, I
think, thrown into jail

where actually, he had done,

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:84%
I think for the old TV show
"Sightings" had done some work,

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:30.116 align:middle line:84%
and there was a place
that was haunted,

00:26:30.116 --> 00:26:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and a killing had
happened there.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:84%

the murder replay.

killer and the victim.

maybe God doesn't want

think scientists

nothing wrong--

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I think there's nothing
wrong with exaggerating,

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.020 align:middle line:84%
as long as you're saying,
hey, we're having fun.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:45.830 align:middle line:90%
We're exaggerating.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:84%
I think, like you, something
I have a concern about is--

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying
all, but I'm saying

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that I do believe in some
of these paranormal shows--

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.010 align:middle line:84%
that they don't necessarily
fabricate things,

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:84%
but they may zhuzh
it up a little bit

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:01.600 align:middle line:84%
to make a little more
titillating and exciting.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is about
the "Campfire" books--

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.918 align:middle line:84%
and some people say, well,
these aren't scary enough.

00:33:05.918 --> 00:33:07.160 align:middle line:90%
And I say, you know what?

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.935 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
true experiences,

00:33:08.935 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:90%
the way people told me.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making stuff up.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm not adding things.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.231 align:middle line:84%
So there's a place
for entertainment,

00:33:14.231 --> 00:33:16.020 align:middle line:84%
as long as it's
labeled entertainment.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And there is a place
for true ghost stories.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.116 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In your series,
"The True Ghost Stories"--

00:33:22.116 --> 00:33:25.780 align:middle line:10%
by Jim Harold, by the way-- how
many stories do you illustrate?

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.104 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: About 70 per book.

00:33:27.104 --> 00:33:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yeah.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.970 align:middle line:84%
A lot people think
it's a little pamphlet.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's like no,
it's 70 stories.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I like to give the people
their money's worth.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
come primarily

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.380 align:middle line:84%
from people who are on
your podcast or write in?

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: They all come-- they
all come in from our podcast.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.270 align:middle line:10%
And they know, when
we're recording,

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.720 align:middle line:10%
that we may use
this in the book.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And they generously
give us permission.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And I edit them a little
for flow and reading,

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:90%
but don't change the facts.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's been very
well-received.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.930 align:middle line:84%
We've been an Amazon
bestseller in the supernatural

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:90%
for the Kindle.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're gonna
keep on keeping on.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I've
got to tell you,

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Jim, people love the paranormal.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:07.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our highest rated
shows are paranormal stories,

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.710 align:middle line:90%
ghost stories, unusual things.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.189 align:middle line:84%
People are into
this in a big way.

00:34:12.189 --> 00:34:12.989 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yeah.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think, as we talked about
before, everybody can relate

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.010 align:middle line:84%
to this, because for
example, everybody

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.960 align:middle line:84%
has a story, whether
it's a ghost story, UFO

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.150 align:middle line:90%
story, an unexplained story.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.980 align:middle line:10%
And they also, I
think, have a yearning

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.560 align:middle line:10%
to know that there's
something else

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.110 align:middle line:10%
than that desk or that book--
that there's something beyond.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.729 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
taps into it as well.

00:34:35.729 --> 00:34:37.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What are
your next projects?

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:38.496 align:middle line:10%
What are you working on?

00:34:38.496 --> 00:34:40.120 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Working on
a "Campfire Five."

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.960 align:middle line:10%
And we're just going to
continue expanding the podcast.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.290 align:middle line:10%
It grows.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:48.560 align:middle line:10%
I looked last weekend, and
"The Paranormal Podcast"

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.924 align:middle line:10%
was the number 11 science
podcast in the United States.

00:34:51.924 --> 00:34:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's great.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: And some
of the scientists

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.409 align:middle line:84%
will be really upset
about that, but that's OK,

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
because that's where all
the skeptic podcasts are.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.270 align:middle line:90%
So that's where I put it.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:01.654 align:middle line:90%
So it continues to grow.

00:35:01.654 --> 00:35:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're just going to
keep doing more of the same,

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.610 align:middle line:84%
maybe adding some
video-type stuff.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.310 align:middle line:84%
But very exciting,
really enjoy what I do--

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:90%
feel very blessed to do it.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
feel about skeptics,

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.870 align:middle line:90%
people who don't believe?

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Well, I think that
skeptics have a rightful place.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And they have a right
to be skeptical.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.145 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Dr.
Michael Shermer,

00:35:24.145 --> 00:35:26.395 align:middle line:84%
who's probably, along with
James Randi, the foremost--

00:35:26.395 --> 00:35:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Skeptical inquirer.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yeah, exactly.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't
believe anything.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: No.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nice guy.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.275 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Nice guy-- I
was going to say that.

00:35:32.275 --> 00:35:33.980 align:middle line:10%
He was a perfect gentleman.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And we talked, and I said,
well, Dr. Shermer, even I

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.050 align:middle line:84%
can say maybe the
majority of things

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:41.070 align:middle line:84%
that people claim are
paranormal are not.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:44.200 align:middle line:84%
They may be telling the truth,
but it may be explicable.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.230 align:middle line:84%
However, what about
that few percent

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
rational explanation?

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I know about
that, but we put that up

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:53.660 align:middle line:90%
on the shelf.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.321 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well, Dr.
Shermer, why don't we take that

00:35:56.321 --> 00:35:57.320 align:middle line:90%
back down off the shelf?

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing about
Dr. Shermer, who I respect-- he

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:04.470 align:middle line:84%
wrote a year or two ago a
story in "Scientific American"

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.220 align:middle line:84%
about something paranormal
that happened to him.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: And of
course, at the end,

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.418 align:middle line:84%
he said, well, of course
this couldn't be paranormal.

00:36:11.418 --> 00:36:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not real.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.395 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: And the thing
that he talked about,

00:36:14.395 --> 00:36:16.470 align:middle line:84%
which was actually
his wife's grandfather

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.770 align:middle line:84%
making a broken radio play
the day of their wedding--

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and it never played before or
since, because his wife said,

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.917 align:middle line:84%
boy, I wish my
granddad was here--

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:27.250 align:middle line:90%
there was no explanation for it.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.000 align:middle line:90%
He tried batteries.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:90%
He tried all this stuff.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:31.100 align:middle line:84%
It worked that day, that wedding
day, after she said that.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.016 align:middle line:90%
It never worked again.

00:36:32.016 --> 00:36:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, of course
that wasn't paranormal.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jimmy, I
want to wrap this up

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:41.705 align:middle line:84%
with you telling us the scariest
story you've ever heard.

00:36:41.705 --> 00:36:42.505 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Oh, man.

00:36:42.505 --> 00:36:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
get a lot of them--

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.790 align:middle line:84%
but the one that
just chilled you.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: I just had
this this last week.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.567 align:middle line:84%
It was on the Show it's not
in any of the books yet.

00:36:52.567 --> 00:36:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we're hearing
this for the first time.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:55.733 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yes, first time.

00:36:55.733 --> 00:36:58.290 align:middle line:90%
The caller's name was Wendy.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.125 align:middle line:84%
She was a kid-- and
I got the picture

00:37:00.125 --> 00:37:01.520 align:middle line:90%
this was 30 or 40 years ago.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So she's probably
in her 50s or 60s.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:07.470 align:middle line:90%
And she used to love candy.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.867 align:middle line:84%
And she would do exactly
what we tell kids not to do.

00:37:10.867 --> 00:37:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't take candy from strangers.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.416 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: And there
was this one guy who

00:37:14.416 --> 00:37:15.790 align:middle line:90%
kept showing up at this park.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And she kept taking
candy from him.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was she a little
girl when this was happening?

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: A little girl--
she was a little girl.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And this guy had a
respirator or something.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.480 align:middle line:90%
So he didn't seem threatening.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.150 align:middle line:84%
He was like an older guy, kind
of like a grandfatherly type.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.430 align:middle line:90%
She thought it was OK.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it wasn't.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this one day, she
shows up, and it's different.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.900 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.190 align:middle line:84%
There's the man, and
there's a woman with him,

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and they're in a car.

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:43.180 align:middle line:10%
And they try to
entice her in the car.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:43.980 align:middle line:10%
Come in the car.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Don't do
it, little girl.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: All of a
sudden, a tall young man

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:51.300 align:middle line:84%
shows up out of nowhere,
almost like he-- poof--

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.560 align:middle line:90%
came from nowhere.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.220 align:middle line:84%
He said to the
man and the woman,

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.490 align:middle line:84%
leave that little
girl well alone.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:04.740 align:middle line:84%
He said to the little
girl, run home now!

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.450 align:middle line:90%
She turned around.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:07.890 align:middle line:90%
The boy was gone.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.690 align:middle line:84%
He vanished as soon
as he told her that.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: She ran home.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Not two or three
weeks later, that man

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.560 align:middle line:84%
was arrested for
accosting children.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In that park?

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yeah.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
frightening to me.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.930 align:middle line:90%
That's real life frightening.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.900 align:middle line:84%
It's reassuring in a sense-- I
do believe in guardian angels.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.897 align:middle line:10%
And she had her guardian angel,
who appeared out of nowhere--

00:38:27.897 --> 00:38:29.730 align:middle line:10%
but frightening of what
could have happened.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.500 align:middle line:10%
Something is out there that
protects some people sometimes.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.300 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Yes.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.007 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It doesn't protect
everybody all the time, right?

00:38:37.007 --> 00:38:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Everybody.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I wonder why.

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.651 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Don't know, you have
to ask somebody bigger than me

00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:42.470 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Yeah, it is.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.221 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you love
doing what you're doing?

00:38:46.221 --> 00:38:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Well, just that--
just to ponder the question.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.513 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't get
bored with this stuff.

00:38:50.513 --> 00:38:53.660 align:middle line:84%
People would think--
I've done 1,100 podcasts.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And I know for you too,
you've done way-- you've

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:58.432 align:middle line:90%
done a tremendous amount.

00:38:58.432 --> 00:38:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't get
boring, does it?

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:00.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never.

00:39:00.565 --> 00:39:01.365 align:middle line:10%
Never.

00:39:01.365 --> 00:39:03.880 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Because it speaks
to the truth of life.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that truth
is, I don't know.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.900 align:middle line:90%
But we know it's out there.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So what do
you tell somebody

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:13.540 align:middle line:10%
who is on the fence
about the paranormal?

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.580 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know
quite what to believe.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: Well, I would say keep
an open mind, but not so open

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.160 align:middle line:90%
your brains fall out.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And just keep thinking
about your life.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Things have happened
to you and people

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.782 align:middle line:84%
that you know, like,
and trust-- people you

00:39:27.782 --> 00:39:28.990 align:middle line:90%
know who wouldn't lie to you.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And think about
the stories they've

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:31.880 align:middle line:90%
told you through their life.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, could some of those
people be mistaken or had

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.900 align:middle line:90%
a dream or a hallucination?

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, some-- but not all.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Just think about real life.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean you have
to watch every ghost hunting TV

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:45.810 align:middle line:84%
show or listen to
every radio show

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:47.340 align:middle line:90%
or podcast or read every book.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But keep an open mind,
because I bet you,

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:84%
if you search your
own life experience,

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:54.915 align:middle line:84%
you will see that the
paranormal and the supernatural

00:39:54.915 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:90%
have showed up in it.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're a
non-believer, what kind of life

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:90%
do you live?

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Does it matter?

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HAROLD: For me,
it would be tough,

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:06.045 align:middle line:84%
because people ask me,
well, what part of this

00:40:06.045 --> 00:40:07.170 align:middle line:90%
are you most interested in?

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Say you don't
believe in anything--

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HAROLD: Right.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me-- I like to
consider myself a good person.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.870 align:middle line:84%
But if I thought this
was it, I would probably

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.530 align:middle line:84%
be a different person, maybe
not a very nice person.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like, hey, I'd better
grab all the fun I can,

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.780 align:middle line:90%
because this is it.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.830 align:middle line:90%
But I don't believe that.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:25.788 align:middle line:90%
I believe there's more.

00:40:25.788 --> 00:40:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And I do think
that, in some way,

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:32.624 align:middle line:84%
we're rewarded or
maybe even punished.

00:40:32.624 --> 00:40:34.665 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming Hitler didn't
have a great afterlife

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:37.030 align:middle line:90%
or hasn't had a great afterlife.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.724 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hope he's
burning in hell.

00:40:38.724 --> 00:40:40.515 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Actually, I
agree with you, 110%.

00:40:40.515 --> 00:40:41.681 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If there is a hell.

00:40:41.681 --> 00:40:44.810 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: I agree
with you 110% on that.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.140 align:middle line:10%
But if this is all
there is-- I mean,

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.990 align:middle line:10%
I love this is, this
is fun talking to you.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's kind of depressing.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know-- I've
never been a non-believer,

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:57.219 align:middle line:84%
so I couldn't say how I would
reconcile myself to that.

00:40:57.219 --> 00:40:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if people want
to listen to "The Paranormal

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.210 align:middle line:90%
Podcast," how do they find you?

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.200 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: jimharold.com--
also, it's

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.810 align:middle line:10%
on iTunes, or if you have the
Podcast app on your iPhone.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:08.660 align:middle line:10%
I've got my own app for Android.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.470 align:middle line:10%
So jimharold.com is the place
that you go and connect you

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.230 align:middle line:10%
to all that stuff and the books.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.247 align:middle line:10%
And we certainly hope
people will give it a try.

00:41:16.247 --> 00:41:18.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jim, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:19.210 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Thank you, sir.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:23.770 align:middle line:84%
The paranormal world-- believe
it or not, that's up to you.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.940 align:middle line:90%
But I'll tell you one thing.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:29.330 align:middle line:10%
In my experience, it's real.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:33.260 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:39.380 align:middle line:90%
