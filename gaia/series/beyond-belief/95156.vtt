>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.598 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:10.742 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.742 --> 00:00:13.640 align:middle line:84%

really happened.

>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.130 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

>>SANDRA CHAMPLAIN: It is
mankind's biggest fear-- dying.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Is there any proof
of life after death?

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.950 align:middle line:84%
I was raised Catholic,
and although I

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.810 align:middle line:84%
believe in faith
in God, it wasn't

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.320 align:middle line:90%
enough to rest of my fears.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.340 align:middle line:84%
People often ask
me where is heaven,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:84%
where are our loved ones
after they've passed away.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.340 align:middle line:90%
There are two ways to live.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:10%
You can live as if
nothing is a miracle,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:10%
you can live as if
everything is a miracle.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:90%
All we are is energy.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Talking about dowsing, dowsing
rods can pick up energy.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Dad, if you're with me,
just show me where you are.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Electronic voice
phenomenon is something

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.594 align:middle line:90%
I want to share with you.

>>GEORGE NOORY: It
was the fear of dying

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.100 align:middle line:10%
in that led Sandra Champlain
on a 15-year journey

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:10%
to try to decide is
there life after death.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:10%
Her results of course, in
her book, "We Don't Die."

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to "Beyond
Belief," Sandra Champlain.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:10%
Sandra, welcome.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDRA CHAMPLAIN: Hi, George.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for having me.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
fun talking to you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:84%
on the radio show,
"Coast to Coast."

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It was a blast.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're going to
have fun on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: We are.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is like real
life stuff now, isn't it?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.813 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I know.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's very exciting to lay my
eyes on you for the first time.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.070 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about this
journey that you undertook.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.460 align:middle line:90%
And what happened to you?

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Well, first of all,
it was a very secret journey.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.422 align:middle line:10%
I used to badmouth people that
believed in life after death.

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:09.005 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean bad-mouthed?

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Oh, I would
think they were a lunatic.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.252 align:middle line:84%
I'd go into a bookstore, and
I'd see the spirituality section

00:02:14.252 --> 00:02:15.210 align:middle line:90%
and the occult section.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you'd
laugh about it?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I'd laugh.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:90%
These people need to get a life.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You probably
marked it up and scribbled--

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: No
proof of that stuff.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:10%
And I grew up in a family that
it wasn't talked about much.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.820 align:middle line:84%
There is a local medium in town,
and everybody laughed at her.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up just thinking
none of that's real.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.280 align:middle line:84%
But what happened to me
is one day I woke up,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and I had this
incredible fear of death.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:84%
It was-- you know, there
are moments that we look up

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.882 align:middle line:84%
at the stars and
they're overwhelming

00:02:39.882 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
when you think of the
vastness of the universe.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gorgeous.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN:
Gorgeous, yes, but who

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:84%
am I in this big
vastness of life?

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:90%
And what is my life for?

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when
Sandra comes to an end?

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And even though I
grew up Catholic,

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.810 align:middle line:84%
went to mass every
Sunday, just hearing

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:84%
the words "you
should have faith"

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.770 align:middle line:90%
wasn't enough to end this fear.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So I just, very secretly,
went on this journey.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Can I find any proof?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's got to have it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:10%
With 7 billion
people on the earth,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:10%
there has to be something.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So I just started on a search,
first through religion.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And all I did find--
although great religions

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and great common denominators--
were these stories of faith.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:84%
But then from there--
and again, this

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.570 align:middle line:84%
is very secret, because
my whole world knew me

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.477 align:middle line:84%
as Sandra doesn't
believe in that stuff.

00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I took a
course in mediumship.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I worked with someone
who is called a spirit

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:84%
artist, a medium that
actually draws portraits

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:90%
of people she sees around them.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
I studied into the
world of near-death

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:84%
experiencing-- near-death
experiences into reincarnation.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I had enough
belief that we go on.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But I was still too
afraid to tell anyone.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Because my fear would be, even
after taking the medium course,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.816 align:middle line:84%
that someone would say, Sandra,
who do you see around me?

00:04:07.816 --> 00:04:08.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, help us.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And
the truth is-- yeah.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:84%
About 40% to 50% of the
time, I could accurately

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.722 align:middle line:90%
tell people's loved ones.

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I'd know their
names, what they did

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:90%
for work, what they died of.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
But the other times, it
was just my imagination.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody asked me, who
do you see, and I was wrong,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:90%
I'd be ridiculed.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, I took a course
in electronic voice phenomena

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:90%
with Tom and Lisa Butler.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought
if I had some, I

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
mean, audible evidence, not
tangible, that life after death

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.290 align:middle line:84%
is real, that would
help many people.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:90%
And in turn, doing that, it has.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why were you a
skeptic in the beginning?

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I think I was
a skeptic based on my past.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
We've all had times that
we've believed in things.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the holiday
times and Santa.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Or other things
that I knew as a kid

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
to be true only to find out
that I was being lied to,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
or for my own good
being lied to.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or it wasn't there.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.226 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah,
and then my dad

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.685 align:middle line:84%
was an airline pilot
before he passed away.

00:05:12.685 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
airline did he fly?

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: American Airlines.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:90%
He was a captain for American.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He probably
few me around.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.658 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: He probably did.

00:05:18.658 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, great guy.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And everything was real
matter of fact in our lives.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So not a lot of creativity,
although I became a chef.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:90%
That's my day job.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.278 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's your passion?

00:05:32.278 --> 00:05:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: My passion.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But, if I couldn't see it
for myself, it wasn't true.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.949 align:middle line:84%
So I've taken courses on
remote viewing, hypnosis.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds
like you're trying

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:84%
to teach yourself
that it exists.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Teach myself that
it exists and teach others now.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Because especially
now after my dad

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:84%
has passed away, the impact of
believing in life after death,

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.100 align:middle line:84%
not just having
faith but a knowing,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:90%
it takes away grieving time.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And so often, people
die internally

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:90%
when a loved one dies.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I know a woman who grieved 30
years after her husband died

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:90%
and never had her own life.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And so to really know that
her husband's still around,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
that she'll see him again,
that her life is for a purpose.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And I have this
dream that people

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:84%
in the next however many years,
when we close our eyes on Earth

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
for that last time,
where normally we have

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
fear, we're praying,
we have regrets,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.940 align:middle line:84%
but that people close
their eyes and look back.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I got my
money's worth out of that life.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a good run.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.143 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It was.

00:06:47.143 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:90%
I went after my dreams.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of fear,
as you know, being human.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
But the best way to
go get your dreams

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
fulfilled is when we
go through the fear.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know,
Sandra, I've always told myself,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.407 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know what--
and I've sometimes doubted

00:07:01.407 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:90%
the existence of the other side.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Oh sure.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.898 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even with
all the research

00:07:04.898 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:90%
and things that I've done.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.127 align:middle line:84%
But I've told myself,
one, if I'm wrong,

00:07:10.127 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:90%
because I do believe it exists--

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.584 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I know you do.

00:07:12.584 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if I'm wrong,
you're not going to know it,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:90%
so don't worry about it.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're right, you're
going to know about it,

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:90%
and so life moves on.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I think one of
the fears of dying

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:84%
for most people is
that it's the finale.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the end.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't believe
in the other side,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.470 align:middle line:84%
if they don't believe
in life after death,

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:90%
it's like a panic sets in.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this is it,
it's over, it's done.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of speaking
engagements around the country,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and we do some
events where I sing.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Cooking is your passion.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Singing is a hobby.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:90%
I have fun.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on YouTube
a lot, looking

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:84%
at all the great performers,
trying to pick songs

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:84%
that I want to sing
at some of the events.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll look at Frank
Sinatra and some of the things

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:90%
he's done and stuff.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
I have really-- it's

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:84%
really hit me--
they're all dead.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.020 align:middle line:84%
All these people that I like,
the Elvis Presleys, the Frank

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:22.081 align:middle line:84%
Sinatras, the Nat King
Coles, they're all dead.

00:08:22.081 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
difficult for me

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:84%
to comprehend that, because
you look at this great life

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:84%
that they all had,
successful, and it's gone.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very
difficult time with that.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.721 align:middle line:90%
I realized we're human beings.

00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:90%
We're all going to die.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:41.512 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: We are.

00:08:41.512 --> 00:08:44.039 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So then
I go on to Wiki,

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking at Dean
Martin and all these people,

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:90%
and they're all dead.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:84%
But I came up with
the realization

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle line:84%
that, you know what, that's
the process of living.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Lost my father
several years ago.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:90%
He was 88 years old.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:90%
I miss him.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.758 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Of course.

00:09:01.758 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it was a great run.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:84%
We should all be that
lucky to go to 88.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:90%
So it changed my whole view.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: They say-- I
heard a great quote lately--

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:84%
that your lifetime is a thread
in the fabric of your soul.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And it gave me this image
that our lives are short,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:84%
but to have that confidence
that when we die,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:90%
it's just the beginning.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:84%
It just the continuation
of something.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I love hearing-- and I started
my own radio show, getting

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:84%
inspired by yours, and
interview people that

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:84%
have either had a
near-death experience

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:84%
or were with a loved
one when they passed.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Because so often,
people come to life

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.887 align:middle line:84%
just moments before they die,
and they can see into heaven.

00:09:52.887 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I've spoken
with a lot of mediums--

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
wide awake almost.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --as well.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and even-- there was
one man, who saw his sister

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and he saw another person,
that he had been in a coma

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:84%
before he passed
and he was never

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:90%
told these people were dead.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.627 align:middle line:90%
And he's talking to them.

00:10:08.627 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're right
there to greet them.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So to hear these
stories and just

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:84%
to hear from people
that our loved ones are

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:84%
right there when
we open our eyes.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Pets that we've had.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I've lost pets, and
I know you have, too.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're the
loves of our lives.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:90%
And to know that--

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Putting down a dog that
you love is the saddest thing.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I know.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Oh, if I can share a story.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
After-- I had to put my
kitty Millie to sleep,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and I was never a cat
person, but this stray cat

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:90%
showed up at my doorstep.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And let her into the
house, and 11 years later--

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.620 align:middle line:84%
but I loved her, just
that unconditional love--

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, she's
part of the family.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.909 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --comes
from an animal.

00:10:49.909 --> 00:10:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And just before my
book got printed,

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I had to do one
last review to make

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.780 align:middle line:84%
sure of the editing
and things like that.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I put Millie
to sleep the night

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
before I had to do
this final review.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.711 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I didn't
care that I wrote a book.

00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You weren't
in the mood for that.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I
wasn't in the mood.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:90%
It hurt so bad.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And as human beings, we grieve,
and it's a normal process,

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:90%
even though it's painful.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%
It is normal.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:90%
But I had to read the book.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So I read it from cover
to cover in a day.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And I got in that moment
that Millie didn't die.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:90%
She was a gift in my life.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I got the impact of
the words in that book,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.610 align:middle line:84%
what they do for someone
who's suffering from grief.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that
Millie-- and this

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:10%
may sound a little woo-woo--
but she gave her life

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.695 align:middle line:10%
when she did so I knew the
power of the words in there.

00:11:45.695 --> 00:11:51.225 align:middle line:84%
There are people that not only
have read those words that

00:11:51.225 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:84%
have-- it's helped
them through grief,

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
but I've gotten many
people that have not

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:84%
committed suicide
because of the words.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.767 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow, that's something.

00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It's very powerful.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So to use it all as
ammunition that, you know,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:90%
I say yes to every interview.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And if I can make a difference
in one person's life or many,

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.335 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do that.

00:12:10.335 --> 00:12:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think the other side is?

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously a natural
process of the living.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:90%
What is it, though?

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I think
it's a place of energy.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:90%
We hear about that often.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And very playfully, people
say, well, where is heaven?

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:84%
We can't see the wireless
internet around us.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.940 align:middle line:84%
When I was on your radio
show, we were connected,

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84%
but we weren't
connected with wires.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:90%
And I could still talk to you.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle line:84%
There's an invisible world
that is vibrating around us.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that heaven
is in that invisible world.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:90%
We are made up of energy.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.892 align:middle line:84%
And even when a log
burns, it turns to heat.

00:12:48.892 --> 00:12:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
different form of energy.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.980 align:middle line:84%
The log is gone, but
the energy still exists.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when we die, when our
body disappears, we go on.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's the George Noory
personality, the Sandra

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Champlain personality, that
us that loves to laugh.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.400 align:middle line:90%
We wake up in a great place.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I think from my studies and
from the people I've talk to,

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
the little voice inside
of our head goes away.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all wake
up in the morning

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and think some very
negative things.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.650 align:middle line:90%
And we have a lot of fear.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.470 align:middle line:90%
That part of us disappears.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And so what's left is our
magnificence, our personality.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:90%
We see our loved ones.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Many people have seen angels.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.870 align:middle line:90%
We always hear of a life review.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And a common denominator
about this life review,

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
which I think is really
cool and a little bit scary,

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
is that we're responsible
for our actions.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So the first life
review we have is

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.430 align:middle line:84%
we see the negative
impact we've had

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
on people from their
perspective-- and not

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:90%
a make-wrong thing.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And nobody's out there
saying, you're good or bad.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:84%
It's heaven for you
or hell for you.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a very personal thing.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:03.555 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where's the devil?

00:14:03.555 --> 00:14:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I think the
devil is here on Earth.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:05.980 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.900 align:middle line:90%
I think with our--

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll talk about
evil in our next program.

00:14:09.025 --> 00:14:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah,
but the life review

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
that we get after the negative
is you see the positive.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Not only the positive
of the impact

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:84%
you've had on others,
but the ripple effect.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, your
life review, George,

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:84%
might be something that, you
know, you do your radio show

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:90%
and your TV show quite often.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
But the lives from
the people that

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:84%
get impacted from your words,
the new actions they take

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.650 align:middle line:84%
in life, the new
faith they have,

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:84%
you'll get to see
the impact of how

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
they bloomed in their
life because of you.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And so after that,
a place of beauty.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:84%
In my book, and I will say this
honestly, I make a comment,

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.214 align:middle line:90%
there's no chocolate in heaven.

00:14:49.214 --> 00:14:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Willy Wonka
would not be happy.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Oh no.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's ticked off
a lot of people.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't put that
in there to really mean

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.171 align:middle line:90%
there's no chocolate in heaven.

00:14:56.171 --> 00:14:58.650 align:middle line:84%
But we have five senses
while we're here on Earth.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.472 align:middle line:84%
And so often, we're busy
maybe on our computer,

00:15:01.472 --> 00:15:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and we're not seeing the
person right in front of us.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to really
embrace the sunrise and sunset

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:84%
or a beautiful piece of music or
chocolate on the tongue, things

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.510 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:84%
But from the people
that I've interviewed,

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:84%
now I haven't heard
about chocolate,

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.100 align:middle line:84%
but it is a place that our
senses are just magnified.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Everything seems alive and real.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
The hearing is much
more clearer and vivid.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Colors, there's colors
that we can't even

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:84%
see on Earth that
exist in the hereafter.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:90%
I can't imagine, but--

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
there's so many

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:84%
people, Sandra, who have
talked about the other side.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:90%
They, like you, were skeptics.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:90%
They didn't believe.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
But we have people like Eben
Alexander, the neurosurgeon,

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.800 align:middle line:84%
who in a coma state
is now convinced

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:90%
that the other side exists.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:54.110 align:middle line:84%
We've had reincarnation
cases of children,

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:90%
who are World War II pilots.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And they know more things about
the plane than was public.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I know.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've gone to
reunions of their former World

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.620 align:middle line:84%
War II soldiers, and
there aren't many left.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And he'll go up to them and
say, hey, Jim, how are you?

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:90%
And those people are in shock.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
something behind all this.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Sure there does.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have used intuition,
clairvoyance in my life.

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:23.875 align:middle line:90%
It's all tied together--

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:24.666 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It is.

00:16:24.666 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --I think.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And what heaven probably
could very well be

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
is just this other force
that we're just all tapped

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.284 align:middle line:84%
into-- as you said, the
wireless portion of it.

00:16:39.284 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: People
have said when

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:84%
they've had the near-death
experiences that, like, I'd

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.530 align:middle line:90%
recognize my dad.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Dad.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:90%
My grandmother, hi, Grammy.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But every soul there,
you recognize them

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:84%
like you've known them forever
and that we are all connected.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's awesome.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know what's
neat too about people

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:84%
that have had near-death
experiences, they remember

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:05.109 align:middle line:84%
the vision they had like
it was just yesterday.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't matter if they were
6 years old or 51 years old--

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:90%
just like it was yesterday.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:84%
People that have had a
near-death experience

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:84%
compare that reality to so much
more real than here on Earth.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:84%
And it makes our life on
Earth seem like just a dream.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.764 align:middle line:84%
I had-- and I won't talk too
much about this-- in 2000

00:17:27.764 --> 00:17:28.764 align:middle line:90%
a near-death experience.

00:17:28.764 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I
did not know that.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not many people do.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm just probably revealing
it for the first time

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:90%
on this program.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.280 align:middle line:90%
And I don't talk a lot about it.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:84%
My very close-knit family
knows about it, obviously.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
on-- I didn't die,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.874 align:middle line:84%
so it wasn't one of those
where your heart stopped

00:17:51.874 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I didn't die.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:90%
But I was right on the cusp.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I was close to this
existence and what

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.510 align:middle line:90%
could be on the other side.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And what happened to me
is when I fully came back

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.310 align:middle line:84%
into the physical end,
it changed my outlook

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.640 align:middle line:90%
about everything, everything.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I no longer am concerned
about five years from now.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm living for today.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm no longer concerned about
bitterness of people and stuff.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.990 align:middle line:90%
To me, every day's a gift.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Laugh about it, have fun, enjoy.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:90%
Help other people along the way.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:84%
That's what I try to
do with the radio show

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.740 align:middle line:90%
and with "Beyond Belief."

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But it was an eye
opening experience

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that I don't wish on
everybody, obviously.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:84%
But it does change
your perspective.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.724 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN:
There's a difference

00:18:47.724 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:90%
on how you live life.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.007 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with a race
car driver that

00:18:51.007 --> 00:18:52.590 align:middle line:84%
had had a near-death
experience, and I

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.173 align:middle line:84%
was the first person
he told about it.

00:18:54.173 --> 00:18:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Because he-- a very
professional man--

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.820 align:middle line:84%
didn't want people to
think he was a lunatic.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.510 align:middle line:84%
But he confided in me
and gave me permission

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:90%
to tell the story.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:84%
But he said when
he died on a table

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.019 align:middle line:84%
after being in a
car accident, he

00:19:08.019 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
said immediately, his
grandmother and grandfather

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:84%
were there in a world that's
so much more real than this.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.110 align:middle line:90%
And he knew he was OK.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And he knew everybody
on Earth would be fine.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And he was given a choice
whether to continue on

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:90%
with them or go back.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And many don't
want to come back.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: No,
because it's great.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But he looked down, and he saw
his mom and dad and brother

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:90%
praying for him.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that the thing
to do would be to return.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And why he told me this story
is because this man went on

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:84%
to drive NASCAR sports
cars, won championships

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:42.602 align:middle line:90%
upon championships.

00:19:42.602 --> 00:19:43.768 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Changed everything.

00:19:43.768 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: He's
extremely famous.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But the message is,
Sandra, because I

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.500 align:middle line:84%
wasn't afraid of dying, I
wasn't afraid of living.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:84%
I put my foot on that pedal
and could drive faster

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:84%
than anybody, took more chances,
because the fear wasn't there.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wasn't
reckless, though.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: He
wasn't reckless, no.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.029 align:middle line:84%
However, if people don't
have to have a near--

00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it Emerson--

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: You can't say.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.023 align:middle line:90%

00:20:09.023 --> 00:20:11.397 align:middle line:90%
No, I can't.

00:20:11.397 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I may, but I'll have to ask
his permission for the name.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:14.646 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I understand.

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: But if I can-- and
this is the whole reason why

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm out in the
world sharing this,

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.950 align:middle line:84%
whether people read
my book or not--

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
is if people can live their
life knowing that death

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:84%
is an illusion, knowing that
their life here on Earth

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:84%
is important, that it's a
place to learn, it's a place

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.895 align:middle line:84%
to have all these
emotional experiences,

00:20:35.895 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:84%
a place to forgive, a place
for unconditional love.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.520 align:middle line:84%
To understand that our worst
pain, when we survive it,

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.380 align:middle line:90%
can be our best gift.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And I never expect from
the death of my dad

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.900 align:middle line:84%
that I'd be helping tens
of thousands of people

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.560 align:middle line:90%
through grief and believe.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But when people
can believe that,

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have to
have a near-death experience

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:90%
to play full out in their life.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of times
that we all get afraid.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And to realize fear
is an illusion.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of the fear

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:84%
might be where your biggest
dream can come true.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, but there
is also real grief.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.769 align:middle line:90%
When a little child dies.

00:21:11.769 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: No question.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or someone much younger
than what you would consider

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.690 align:middle line:84%
to be a good run in
your life passes on.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not fair.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people question
how can a god do this?

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
How can a god take
a little baby?

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.180 align:middle line:84%
How can a god take somebody
in their 20s or 30s?

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.820 align:middle line:84%
My answer to that is God
doesn't control that.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't think God
cherry picks lives.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I think whatever
this divine force

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:84%
is, I don't know what
it is, but it's there.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.075 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Correct.

00:21:48.075 --> 00:21:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't know how it
started, but I know it's there.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it has
that ability to control.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I think, it's free will, we're
off and away, we do our thing.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So when a young child
dies, it's rotten luck.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.202 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a god
that is doing that.

00:22:09.202 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Or a punishment.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.451 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a punishment.

00:22:11.451 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And I cannot-- and
this is going to be the biggest

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:84%
question I have when I
open my eyes in heaven,

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and I believe in heaven--
is why all the suffering.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Because when I watched my
dad die, it was cancer.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:23.588 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did he suffer?

00:22:23.588 --> 00:22:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: He suffered.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.010 align:middle line:90%
And he was very religious.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So I read to him a
passage in the Bible

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.830 align:middle line:84%
that said those that suffer
the most are closest to Jesus.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if that's
true or not, but I read it.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And even interviewing
people, it's

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.501 align:middle line:84%
like, what do you
think the reason is

00:22:39.501 --> 00:22:40.630 align:middle line:90%
for all the suffering?

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, I know
from my own suffering

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:47.680 align:middle line:84%
from dad dying, that prompted
me to do the research on grief

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and a lot more about life
after death and publish this.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:55.810 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that I became a
different person in how I dealt

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:84%
with, say, the doctors
or my family when

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:90%
I was in the hospital.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And my suffering, I became a
different person, and I had--

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More accepting?

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: More
accepting, more compassion.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I personally got a
lot of growth for my soul,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.250 align:middle line:90%
looking back on it.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say if that's
the reason we suffer or not.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But there is a possibility
that other people

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.375 align:middle line:90%
are impacted in a good way.

00:23:21.375 --> 00:23:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And so, like I
said, that's going

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:90%
to be my biggest question.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.472 align:middle line:84%
Because why a child has
to die or why-- I mean,

00:23:26.472 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
there is so much
pain in the world,

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.304 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had the
answer for that.

00:23:29.304 --> 00:23:31.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about "We Don't Die."

00:23:31.602 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Oh, it's my baby.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm single.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your best-selling baby.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah, after
being on your show,

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.432 align:middle line:84%
it hit a number
one best seller--

00:23:39.432 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's exciting.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.675 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --in the United
States, UK, and Canada.

00:23:42.675 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: So you have
a very powerful show

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and great listeners, so
I thank you for that.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're passionate.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: But I
talk about my journey,

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.840 align:middle line:84%
about why I believe
in life after death.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.755 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very playful,
as you can tell.

00:23:52.755 --> 00:23:53.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not a heavy read.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a very light read.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's my journey through
all the different things

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I studied-- the examples
of the electronic voice

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:84%
phenomena I got; and
how Dr. Ken Ring, who

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.240 align:middle line:84%
does near-death
experience studies,

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
only studied blind
people, and they

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.270 align:middle line:84%
can see for the very first time
in a near-death experience;

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and all those
things that gave me

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.480 align:middle line:84%
the ammunition and
the belief, not faith,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:84%
but belief beyond a shadow
of a doubt that we don't die.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
beginning of the book.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:90%
There's one chapter on grief.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And it is very painful
that we go through grief.

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to give people
an understanding, besides just

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:84%
the different stages
that we go through,

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.780 align:middle line:84%
how our brain chemistry
actually changes when we grieve.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:84%
We lose a lot of our
communication and perception.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.347 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:24:38.347 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: There's
a lot of families

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that have come
apart during grief.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And I give an explanation for
what's happening in the brain.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's healed
a lot of people.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And so after that, it's
like, well, if we don't die,

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.100 align:middle line:90%
what is our life for?

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So I've had people find
their life's purpose

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:84%
reading the pages,
and that's cool.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And just being able to
declare and get back

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:84%
in touch with that place,
where you have the dreams

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and make the most use
of your life while

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.690 align:middle line:84%
you're here, to have
great relationships,

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:84%
to have fun and have joy,
and to make a difference.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And when we no longer
fear death and we're

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.590 align:middle line:84%
no longer worried about
me, me, me all of the time,

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.920 align:middle line:84%
it's a real natural
response for people

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:90%
to want to make a difference.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So whether they want to clothe
the homeless or-- however

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.350 align:middle line:84%
they want to make a difference,
Habitat for Humanity,

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.520 align:middle line:90%
or any way.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.810 align:middle line:84%
But people naturally find
that giving is where it's at.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And you know this, and I
think we all know this,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.170 align:middle line:84%
when we tap in to
ourselves, when

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:84%
we're not thinking about
our lives, our problems,

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
our stresses, and when
we have the attention

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
on how can I make a
difference for another person,

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.990 align:middle line:90%
we feel the best.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And it makes just a profound
difference in so many lives.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's a side effect
people get out of the book.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We talked a
little bit about your cat.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Millie, yes.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lots of people
love their animals

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:90%
and their animals pass on.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.354 align:middle line:84%
You're convinced they
carry on as well.

00:26:09.354 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I am convinced.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.084 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:26:13.084 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:84%
You would not have
been years ago.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.326 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Well, no, no.

00:26:16.326 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not animals.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.654 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I would've never
listened to "Coast to Coast"

00:26:18.654 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if you
didn't even believe people go.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I know,
but not animals.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And animals are just such
pure living demonstrations

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.770 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's a beautiful poem
called "The Rainbow Bridge."

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me cry
every time I read it.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.830 align:middle line:84%
But just that all
of our animals are

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.550 align:middle line:84%
living in this great place
of plenty of sunshine,

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:90%
plenty of play.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Not just animals, but human
beings as well, when we die,

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:84%
we get to pick our best
age and our best health.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.630 align:middle line:90%
And so they're all OK.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.480 align:middle line:84%
But the moment that
comes that we cross over,

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.164 align:middle line:90%
there's this Rainbow Bridge.

00:26:55.164 --> 00:26:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And just on the other
side of the bridge

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.670 align:middle line:84%
is that wagging tail that's just
ready to see you and greet you

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.804 align:middle line:84%
and to jump into your arms-- if
it's a cat, maybe not a horse.

00:27:04.804 --> 00:27:05.970 align:middle line:90%
And that they're there, too.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about a pet frog?

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Why not?

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or one of
our drivers here

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:84%
has a pet turtle, who's been on
the program before, by the way.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: That's awesome.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.530 align:middle line:90%
And why not?

And even doing--

00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a life force.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It is.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, because
there's so many skeptics.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And we often think,
if we can't see it,

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to believe it.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:84%
But like I mentioned the
wireless internet is around us;

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:90%
we can't see it.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Even this desk here is
made up of molecules.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And inside the
molecules are atoms.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And inside the atoms, if we
had a teeny tiny little camera

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and we put a camera inside the
atom, it's invisible space.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:90%
There's just vibrating energy.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So everything we see, we
touch, we hear, we smell

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.970 align:middle line:90%
is all just energy.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I feel bad
now batting a fly.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I do, too.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or when I was a
little kid, I loved ants.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.410 align:middle line:90%
I studied them.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:90%
I had ant farms.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:90%
I watched how they worked.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:84%
I would sometimes put a little
red ant in with all black ants

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:08.710 align:middle line:90%
and see what they did with them.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:09.959 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: See what happens?

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, I
did all these things.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But I also remember I used
to break up their houses.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:90%
They had these little ant hills.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know
what was inside.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So I'd whack off the top, and
you'd see all these little ants

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:25.150 align:middle line:90%
in there scurrying around.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, because I believe
everything is a life force,

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.570 align:middle line:90%
I actually feel bad.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, here's
this taller person,

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm bigger than
them, that's all.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.880 align:middle line:84%
They're probably
smarter than most of us.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.510 align:middle line:84%
But I feel real
bad about that now.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I just
got this image of you

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.800 align:middle line:84%

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.920 align:middle line:84%
you're looking from the

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.590 align:middle line:84%

Splat.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:90%
And I did in fact--

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: I destroyed
their lives.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: But being a
kid, you're very inquisitive.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:84%
I felt bad for some animals
that I've seen in the zoo.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, this
is their whole life?

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
looking at us.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.288 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: But to realize--

00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --saying
get me out of here.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --the growth
that I had as a young person

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.130 align:middle line:90%
learning about lions and tigers.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And I got an opportunity
to go to South Africa once,

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
I had studied about,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.250 align:middle line:90%
I could see first hand.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe we all really
do have a purpose in life

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and some of those
animals are to teach us.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, I don't
like mosquitoes.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.665 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Me neither.

00:29:32.665 --> 00:29:34.640 align:middle line:84%

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.823 align:middle line:84%

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:39.955 align:middle line:90%

And it's like, well, I get it.

00:29:43.454 --> 00:29:44.870 align:middle line:84%
But there could
be something else.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There could be
better food for those birds.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:84%

We live in the Milky Way
galaxy, our solar system.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.260 align:middle line:10%
And I did a little research
that there's probably

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.806 align:middle line:10%
20 billion other--

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's just in our galaxy.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:35.750 align:middle line:10%
And there could be 200 to
400 billion other galaxies

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.114 align:middle line:10%
out there, just based on the--

00:30:37.114 --> 00:30:38.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There's
other life forms.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.500 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: So it's so
easy for us to say life

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.690 align:middle line:10%
after death is impossible.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:45.794 align:middle line:90%
There's no proof.

00:30:45.794 --> 00:30:47.835 align:middle line:84%
But when we start-- and
that's what I ask people,

00:30:47.835 --> 00:30:51.800 align:middle line:84%
is just try to expand your
horizons, whatever that may be.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
a miraculous world

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:84%
that's vibrating
around us right now.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you open up to the
possibility of it-- and even,

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.320 align:middle line:84%
whether you want to study
quantum physics a little bit

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.640 align:middle line:84%
or the universe and
the cosmos-- I'm

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.190 align:middle line:84%
interested in people
having a great life now.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And when we start
researching that-- and even

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.350 align:middle line:84%
the guests that you've
had on your shows--

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:14.760 align:middle line:90%
opens up a whole new world.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can create new
passions and excitement.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:18.461 align:middle line:90%
And that's a joyful life.
