>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief"

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:84%
with our special guest
today, Randy Veitenheimer.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:10%
He's been a student
and practitioner

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:10%
of martial arts, yoga,
energetic medicine

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:10%
for more than 40 years.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:10%
He works with
individuals, corporations,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:10%
in the fields of energy
and consciousness.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Randy is an author and the
host of a new series on Gaia

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
that you've got to watch
called the "Quantum Effect".

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Randy welcome to the program.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
Happy to be here.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm pleased to meet you.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.425 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Randy, it's not every
day that somebody gets involved

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:90%
in energy and consciousness.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.612 align:middle line:84%
How did this all happen for
you to create it as a career?

00:00:57.612 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Well, you
don't normally seek it out

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.490 align:middle line:10%
as a career, especially
40 years ago.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:10%
But one of the things
about studying martial arts

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:10%
is once you learn the
exterior martial arts, and all

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:10%
the movements everything,
you advance to a state

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:10%
where you go into
internal martial arts.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And internal martial arts were
rarely taught in this country

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:90%
back in the 70s.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the
same time, yoga,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:84%
once you advance
to a certain level,

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
they start talking
about energy flow,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and start talking about
your energy field,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, the more I
got off into those,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:84%
the more I practiced them,
the more interested I became,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and I had a
background in physics,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.400 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to
assimilate the language,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences, and the
teachings I was receiving.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This work of combining
energy and consciousness,

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:84%
is it unusual or does that
happen a lot for people?

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: The problem
becomes that all your conscious

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:90%
existence is driven by energy.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:84%
You either have
energy or you don't.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Or you don't.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Or you don't.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.580 align:middle line:84%
All illnesses, all
disease is lack

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:84%
of energy or too much supporting
either the good or the bad.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a health issue,
you have an energy issue.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.180 align:middle line:90%
You have an energy problem.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's real simple.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in physics, they
call it Delta 5 or delta-v,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
meaning you either
accelerate the energy

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
or you decelerate it in order
to get to a different point.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the same thing
happens when you have a cold

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.880 align:middle line:84%
or even a minor
illness is you're

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:90%
applying more energy to it.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like why
you're always tired.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So most people are always tired,
but you can learn techniques.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:84%
You can learn routines-- and
I describe them in the book

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing--

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:84%
where you learn to maintain
a constant level of energy,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.442 align:middle line:84%
or even an increased
level of energy.

00:02:52.442 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And when
you talk about energy,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:84%
it's not just merely,
hi, how are you?

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling good.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:90%
It's something else, isn't it?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes, because
the thing that science has

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:84%
never addressed is
life force, right?

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So we
talk about DC Electric,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:90%
Direct Current.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
We talk about
alternating current.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's our language.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well,
how come you use

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:90%
words like voltage and stuff?

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're just
borrowing language,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:84%
but nobody ever came
up with LC, life force,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:90%
it's a bioelectric charge.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And bioelectric is
different than AC or DC,

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:84%
but it is a form of
electricity or energy.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:90%
So we want to look at that.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:84%
What is the life force
that flows through you?

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Nobody answers it.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is
basically what I've

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.000 align:middle line:90%
been chasing for 30 40 years.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why are those people
who have healing properties

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:84%
about them able to heal people
by rubbing their hands over

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:90%
their bodies?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes not even
touching the body.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.390 align:middle line:90%
But it seems to work.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've heard cases
and cases if these things.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: It's
a phenomena in China.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.288 align:middle line:84%
It's called medical qigong,
Q-I-G-O-N-G therapy.

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It's something I've studied,
again, for 30 or 40 years.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So like chi-gong?

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
Qiging, gigong, ligong.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a bunch of
gongs out there.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about it is
you have an energy field.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:84%
And that energy field
has information in it.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And somebody with a stronger
energy feel can override yours.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So the exercise in
internal martial arts,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.220 align:middle line:84%
qigong, the internal practices
of advanced yoga techniques,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.220 align:middle line:84%
is that you have more
energy in your energy field

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:84%
to be able to override either
the memory or the frequency

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
information flow that's
creating the illness, cancer,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of things.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So a person can develop to
where they have excess energy.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:90%
The technique is very simple.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like patent
somebody on the back.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%
You're giving them energy.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:84%
You're giving them
energy of concern,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and hope, and all kinds
of other emotions.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But think about if you had
enough energy and access

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to be able to alter what's
going on with that person.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I do it all the time.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Mainly, because I have
a bigger energy field.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can you feel
yourself helping somebody?

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes, and
some people respond to it.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Some people are aware of it.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I had a client,
she was in her 80s.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
It's embarrassing, she said
every time I touch her,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:90%
she gets a tingly feeling.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:90%
And then-- she's a great lady.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But then, other
people don't notice.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I've had people call me and say
they didn't notice anything.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.050 align:middle line:84%
But two days later, it's
like the problem is gone.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So the language
is, I'm able to, let's say,

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:84%
generate enough excess energy
to change what's going on in you

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:84%
to the degree you
can be changed.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
it's a 50-50 deal.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How long does it
take to do this to somebody?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Is it instantaneous?

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Does it take weeks?

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: No, I had a
client came to me one time.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.288 align:middle line:90%
He said, I don't have an hour.

00:06:04.288 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I don't have an hour.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.497 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:06:06.497 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Can you do this any faster?

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I can
do it in 14 seconds,

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:84%
but it makes some major shifts
in your conscious and stuff,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how
you'll deal with that.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.670 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I'll pay
you for the 14 seconds,

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
so it's resetting all the
field meridians in the body,

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:90%
is one way to look at it.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:84%
It's increasing the
size of the energy field

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:90%
is another way to look at it.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have more energy,
you're going to fix yourself.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you like
a lightning bolt rod?

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Sometimes
people experience excess energy

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:90%
flow.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:90%
I try to keep it even.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Moderate.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.225 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
Around moderate, yeah.

00:06:46.225 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Your first
episode of "Quantum Effect"

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.266 align:middle line:90%
from Gaia is a dramatic show.

[THEME MUSIC]

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Everybody
asks the question, who are you?

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:10%
But I ask the
question, what are you?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:10%
I am Randy Veitenheimer
and for years I

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:10%
have been studying with
some of the top masters

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:10%
of the world that deal with
the idea of consciousness.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:10%
Today, I want to offer a
new view on consciousness

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:10%
that I hope might help you
remove locks and get you

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.032 align:middle line:10%
back to who you are.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.090 align:middle line:10%
So what is consciousness?

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.940 align:middle line:10%
The greatest thing about
being human is consciousness.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it's the only thing
that defines our existence.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness is awareness
of one's self existence

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.410 align:middle line:10%
and existence as self.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle line:10%
This is the duality.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness is self awareness
and awareness of the self.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
There have been many attempts
to examine consciousness.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:90%
How's it work?

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.310 align:middle line:10%
The current model is breaking
down human consciousness

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:10%
into subcategories, per Freud.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:10%
He broke consciousness
down into three layers,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:10%
the alert consciousness,
the subconsciousness,

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.640 align:middle line:10%
and unconsciousness.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.410 align:middle line:10%
In my opinion, consciousness
is not layered or subdivided.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.298 align:middle line:10%
It is homogeneous.

When we deal with
human consciousness,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:10%
we also deal with a collective
consciousness of humanity,

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:10%
and not as a separate,
but as an integrated

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:10%
part of human consciousness
and knowledge.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:46.880 align:middle line:10%
We can examine human
collective consciousness.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:10%
What does it mean to be human?

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:10%
What does it mean to share
a collective consciousness,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:10%
to share and be a part of
a collective consciousness

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:10%
Group consciousness,
religion, family, politics,

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:10%
tribal consciousness,
creative consciousness, these

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:19.530 align:middle line:10%
are all aspects of what
it means to be human.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:10%
And if you are human, you
are human as a species

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:10%
and as an individual.

>> VEITENHEIMER: Thank you.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.425 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it all ties
together, doesn't it?

00:09:30.425 --> 00:09:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it ties together because
we don't have the awareness as

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:41.120 align:middle line:84%
a rule of where our
thoughts or even where

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.310 align:middle line:90%
our life force comes from.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
You explore it through
meditation, and contemplation,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things we
never address is ourselves.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:84%
When somebody says, I'm
George or I'm Randy,

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
what does that mean and
what's the truth of it?

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, that was part of the
key to understanding things

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:84%
about the human consciousness
and human awareness.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is like we
could look at somebody

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and through calibration go,
how George is George today?

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
How much energy do you
have along your spine?

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:22.700 align:middle line:84%
How much connection do you have
with all your past experiences?

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:90%
How many inputs do you have?

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And those four things,
or five things,

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:84%
start giving me a picture
of where you are today.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody says
they have a problem,

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.450 align:middle line:84%
we want to look at all that,
because just not being yourself

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:84%
allows for room to
have experiences maybe

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't want to.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, the connections
you have to your past

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and experiences open you
up to other experiences

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:84%
or connections that, again,
may be beneficial or not.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So some people
call all that karma

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
on what I call the
right side, but we

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.800 align:middle line:90%
want to know how you are you.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.030 align:middle line:84%
The average person out there,
loves this, is usually 2% or 3%

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.610 align:middle line:84%
The rest are
consciouses involved

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:84%
in collective consciousness,
or group things,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:90%
or things like that.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's all kinds of
information about that.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.480 align:middle line:84%
But when I reset somebody, I
reset and be 100% themselves,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:84%
100% energy flow, and be
able to have a connection

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.910 align:middle line:84%
to understand an awareness
of when they have energy,

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
when they don't, and
when they're themselves

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:90%
and when they're not.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you're with
somebody who needs a healing,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
do you find that almost in
every case when you talk to them

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:84%
before the healing that there's
some issue, or something wrong,

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.630 align:middle line:84%
or something that's happened
to them in their life?

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Well,
if you're not yourself,

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:90%
something happened.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So up
to about six years old,

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.680 align:middle line:90%
most people are themselves.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's a rare thing to come
back to yourself at 100%.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
It usually only occurs
either through contemplation,

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:84%
meditation, some esoteric
techniques, or you

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:84%
get to the end of your
life where you literally

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:90%
come back to yourself.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:84%
You're aware of your
whole existence.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And so, automatically when
I sat down with somebody,

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:84%
the first thing is
how George is George?

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.580 align:middle line:90%
How president is the president.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean we can pick anybody
because the information's

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:90%
in the field.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:90%
So I don't read people.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I connect to the
information field.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And out of that
information field,

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.988 align:middle line:84%
you can draw
information on anything.

00:12:27.988 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What makes somebody
come to you in the first place,

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Randy?

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:90%
What's their issue.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Generally
I never advertise.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.080 align:middle line:90%
It's all word of mouth.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So I've had clients all over
the country, all over the world.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And the reason--
part of the reason

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
is, if somebody knows
somebody that I've worked on,

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to explain it.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.640 align:middle line:90%
So it makes it a little easier.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:84%
But generally,
they're referrals,

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and they cover the entire
range of the human condition

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.860 align:middle line:90%
and human illness.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And the experiences and
problems that we have,

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
physical, mental, emotional,
spiritual, psychic,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:84%
psychological, these are all
aspects of our consciousness.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And everybody's different.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.183 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is unique
in their percentages.

00:13:14.183 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you're
trying to help somebody,

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.982 align:middle line:84%
how important is it
that they help himself?

00:13:18.982 --> 00:13:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Well--

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or can you just
do the whole thing for them?

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
Remember, 50/50.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: I can make the
changes to the degree they can

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:90%
be changed.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They've got
to meet you halfway.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:30.768 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:10%
But sometimes it's
easier on others

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.110 align:middle line:10%
than it is, again, it's that
uniqueness of each individual

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:10%
and everything that combines to
create their present reality.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So usually, I give
them exercises,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
or reading materials,
or things that will

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:90%
support whatever I'm doing.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And those can be
everything from supplements

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
to certain practices,
especially physical practices.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But can you reach somebody
who is a little hesitant?

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, somebody-- what if
somebody comes to you and goes,

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this
is going to work.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The state they're in is that
they're getting more energy

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:84%
from being the way they
are than being different.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard to understand
that some people get energy

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:90%
from being sick.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever skipped school
and told mom, I have a headache?

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Never.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:90%
I never did.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I never--

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I was always there.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll confess,
I tried it once,

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't
stand missing out.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I once got an award from
high school for not missing.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean I was always there.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Sick, I came in,
and everything else.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why I did that.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you liked being there.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and I'm the same way.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you do that, the
benefit of being healthy

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.810 align:middle line:84%
versus benefit of
being unhealthy.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:00.060 align:middle line:84%
The benefit you get
from high emotion

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
or negative emotional
states can be

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
sufficient to override
your entire health regimen,

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and especially if you stay
in it for a long time.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So we say, don't be
depressed for a long time.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:90%
Don't be anxious.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And let me explain
both of those.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just energy flow to the
upper right side of the brain

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:90%
is depression.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, anxiety.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, anxiety.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:90%
And this is depression.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So you have energy
flowing up your spine.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.870 align:middle line:84%
It's energized in that
area of the brain.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:84%
That brain is going into
production of neurochemistry.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And the outcome, we call
depression or anxiety.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.733 align:middle line:84%
Now, it takes about three
seconds to change that.

00:15:38.733 --> 00:15:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd have one of my clients
say you should just

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.870 align:middle line:84%
set up a booth on
the corner for $.05

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and just turn on or turn off,
because literally that's what

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
That process is
turned on, and it's

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.258 align:middle line:90%
turned on and fed by energy.

00:15:51.258 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
like a light switch.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lot of ways to look
at acupuncture, which nobody

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:84%
really explains what's
going on, but you're

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.410 align:middle line:90%
flipping a light switch.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:84%
You're flipping a
switch that alters

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:90%
the energy flow in the body.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:84%
If you don't support a health
condition, it goes away.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's had a
cold and it went away.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.450 align:middle line:84%
You've talked about life
force and quantum effect.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.805 align:middle line:10%
As a healer, we work
with life force.

00:16:20.805 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:84%
We may work with all the
different energies that

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:84%
are referred to in fourth level
physics, particle physics,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:90%
quantum physics.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:10%
But ultimately, we're
working with life force.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:10%
It's a different energy.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:10%
It may be inclusive of
everything we've talked about,

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:10%
but is not separate.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:10%
And it is also not complete
with the level of physics

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:10%
we currently understand.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:10%
What's interesting is
that around the world,

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:10%
other people have approached
us from different viewpoints.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:10%
Konstantin Korotkow in Russia
and some of his associates,

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:05.150 align:middle line:10%
have decided to work
with life force itself.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:84%
They've done it with people who
have extreme physical issues.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were born
without eyesight.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:10%
And yet, as part
of their studies,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:10%
they were able to
develop in a person

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.609 align:middle line:10%
the ability to see
using their life force,

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:10%
using their energy field.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Additional studies they
did were on dead people.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:10%
The ideal that there
is energy in the body,

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:10%
and that its form has
some sort of existence,

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.370 align:middle line:10%
some sort of physicality
which is not explained just

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:42.560 align:middle line:10%
in the physical nature of the
soul, but as an etheric form,

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:10%
as an energy form, that exists
prior to and after you die.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.640 align:middle line:10%
He wants to find the
receptacle for life.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Konstantin's efforts
and experiments

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:90%
are very good reading.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.100 align:middle line:84%
There there's
something that I think

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.095 align:middle line:84%
people should become
familiar with,

00:18:00.095 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:84%
in the same way Elisabeth Kubler
Ross wrote on death and dying.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:84%
These are all subjects that
explore the life force.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:84%
They don't explore
quantum physics

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:90%
as it applies to human beings.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:10%
So why is this important
for you to know?

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:10%
Because if you know you can
start to separate your body

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:10%
energy from life
force energy, you

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:10%
can separate zero
and one reality.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Randy, exactly
what is life force energy?

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: That's the
great question of the ages

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It is?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Because
where does it come from?

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:84%
What's the signature
or frequency

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
of that, because we know
when you pass on it's

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:90%
no longer present.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:90%
So automatically--

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So it leaves
the body when you die?

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Well,
you quit receiving it.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.693 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't leave, because
you're in a constant resupply.

00:18:53.693 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: It's like
turning on a radio, right?

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:56.485 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:18:56.485 --> 00:18:58.670 align:middle line:10%
And so, one of
things in my research

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:10%
is that the human
being reorganizes--

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:10%
it's a frequency problem.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:84%
one 10,020th of a second,
that's what I came up with.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Every 10,020th second, you
get recharged, re-energized,

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.480 align:middle line:10%
And that frequency, I've
been tracking and trying

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.240 align:middle line:10%
to understand because,
again, science tells you

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of things
about the atom,

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.440 align:middle line:10%
but they don't tell you
where life force originates.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.700 align:middle line:90%
How is it broadcast?

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:90%
What's the receiving mechanism?

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are all
important questions,

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I drive
myself crazy every day

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.810 align:middle line:90%
doing the research on?

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So there
is a distinct difference.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:10%
One of the things too,
is quantum physics,

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.140 align:middle line:10%
quantum mechanics, is
a borrowed language.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.120 align:middle line:10%
We borrow that
language so we can

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:10%
use it to try to describe things
that people are not describing.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think there should be
a Manhattan Project on life

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.107 align:middle line:84%
force, because once you
understand life force,

00:20:04.107 --> 00:20:05.690 align:middle line:84%
there's no reason
for you to get sick.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason
for you to age.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it goes
on forever, right?

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.757 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sometimes we
tap into it accidentally--

00:20:13.757 --> 00:20:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes, yes.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Don't we?

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And people
have varying degrees of not only

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:24.080 align:middle line:10%
interaction, but to use the
language of the connection,

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:10%
how strong a connection like
you have with another person.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, same thing
with life force.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
You can become depressed
and to the point

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.780 align:middle line:90%
that you no longer receive it.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.625 align:middle line:90%
You block it.

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You just shut it off.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.308 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: You go away.

00:20:35.308 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you go away.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But integration,
synchronization, and congruency

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
are terms that I use
for how life force works

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.220 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.105 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is life force, Randy,
different from energy force?

00:20:46.105 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.690 align:middle line:10%
It's a frequency
band and signature

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:55.280 align:middle line:10%
that I don't have the funding
or research equipment in order

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:10%
to explore.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.200 align:middle line:90%
It's like the people at--

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:84%
the man who did the
gravity wave experiments.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Millions and millions of
dollars to detect gravity waves,

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:07.833 align:middle line:84%
and there's not
millions and millions

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
of dollars available
for somebody trying

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.480 align:middle line:84%
to determine life
force, because think

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:84%
about what a revolution
that would be in the world

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:84%
to finally have some
understanding of how

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:84%
this body's energize, because
Cheerios and donuts don't

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.266 align:middle line:90%
do it, or coffee.

00:21:22.266 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you had this
ability to combine your power,

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and your force, your energy
force with your life force,

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.270 align:middle line:84%
what does that do for
you as an individual?

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Well,
as martial artists,

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.410 align:middle line:84%
it gives you
incredible abilities.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:10%
And so some of it is
mythical, like when you see

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.480 align:middle line:10%
the films, the Kung Fu films.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:10%
The thing is--

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Or Bruce Lee
and stuff like that.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah,
Bruce Lee and Hidden Dragon,

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:54.810 align:middle line:10%
and you know it's like
there's a basis for those.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And for somebody who's
done internal martial arts,

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:84%
like in Kung Fu,
I've experienced

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
some of those
experiences and developed

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:90%
some of those techniques.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, is to be
able just touch somebody

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:90%
and drop them to the ground.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:07.728 align:middle line:90%
And people say, oh no--

00:22:07.728 --> 00:22:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It happens,
does something.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
Oh yes, it happens.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or you Don't
even have to touch them--

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: That's true.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In some cases.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.180 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And
I used to tease some

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:10%
of the choreographers
for those movies,

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:10%
because of their technique,
we could call it.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:10%
Because the thing is, if you
collapse the human energy

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.350 align:middle line:10%
field, you're dead, right?

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:84%
If you ground it out,
if you are electrocuted,

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
those are all phenomena
that are trying

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.870 align:middle line:84%
to give us a hint that there's
things going on that really we

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.510 align:middle line:84%
should explore and
be able to explain.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing
about science,

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.070 align:middle line:84%
is science does not
explain life force.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:90%
They don't touch it.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's totally
outside science.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:90%
There's no support for it.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:50.100 align:middle line:10%
Nobody is out there
trying to fund it.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet, to me, it's one of
the most important questions

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:56.340 align:middle line:84%
that could ever be answered
about how do I exist.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can't you tell also
when you meet people what kind

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.958 align:middle line:84%
of life force energy
they've got around them?

00:23:01.958 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Mhm, one of
the things I teach is you should

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
have about a 9
foot energy field.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:10%
And today, you're at seven feet.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty healthy.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And I can interrogate your field
or anybody else's on the planet

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:90%
just with a name.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But we can do
exercises and things

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to develop
a bigger inner field.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's martial
arts techniques,

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.102 align:middle line:84%
there's yoga techniques, all
these things are available.

00:23:25.102 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Different ways
to get into that mode.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.977 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:23:27.977 --> 00:23:29.080 align:middle line:10%
And once you explore it--

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:10%
but the important
thing is once you

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.908 align:middle line:10%
become aware you have a 9 foot
inner field, you immediately

00:23:32.908 --> 00:23:34.560 align:middle line:10%
become aware when it's less.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things I teach my students.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.030 align:middle line:84%
You should be aware of
when you lose energy.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you get around somebody
has a big energy field,

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:10%
we call them a
charismatic, right?

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's people like the
president, Mick Jagger, movie

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.062 align:middle line:84%
stars, they generally have
a 30 or 40 foot energy--

00:23:54.062 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They've got
an aura about them.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Well,
that's what we call it.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And people want to be
around them, because they

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:90%
want to take energy from them.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.502 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
And the way I teach,

00:24:02.502 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and the way a normal human
is, energy comes this way.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:10%
It's a vertical energy flow
is one way to look at it,

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:10%
whereas your interactions with
other humans is a horizontal.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about taking
energy from another person,

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.220 align:middle line:90%
we call them vampires.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.345 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Psychic vampires.

00:24:18.345 --> 00:24:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah, is
that that energy is tainted.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.430 align:middle line:90%
It's conditioned.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, therefore, it
may not be palatable.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It may not be
something you can use,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.913 align:middle line:90%
but everybody wants more energy.

00:24:29.913 --> 00:24:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Everybody wants more energy.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Some
people, the psychics.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.455 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:24:33.455 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Vampires, are doing
this and they don't even know

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:36.570 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:37.945 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
That's true too.

00:24:37.945 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And because their consciousness
is not fully energized,

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:90%
that's the other thing.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Fully energized
consciousness is real simple.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:90%
We call it enlightenment.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.868 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean, how
many people, Randy,

00:24:48.868 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:84%
have been at a
party or someplace,

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're around someone that
you have to get away from.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.470 align:middle line:84%
You just don't want
to be around them.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
they're bad people,

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.360 align:middle line:84%
but you just have that
feeling that they exhaust

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.848 align:middle line:84%
and drain you just by
standing next to them.

00:25:06.848 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:84%
These are the psychic
vampires aren't they?

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.515 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:25:09.515 --> 00:25:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and if you are
not self-sufficient

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.860 align:middle line:84%
with your energy,
which is accomplished

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:84%
by being alive and
being receptive to life

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:84%
force, or biological
energy, then you

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:84%
want to get more energy
because generally you're off,

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:90%
or you need it.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.800 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
money, we would say.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just an equivalent.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:90%
And you could use more.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But these people don't have
the conscious to realize

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.130 align:middle line:84%
that they're being a vampire,
that they are sucking

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:90%
energy from another person.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And so, even there,
you can't even

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.170 align:middle line:84%
hardly tell them
without them getting

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:44.750 align:middle line:90%
more angry, and more negative.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Right, because
they won't believe you,

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:90%
first of all.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes, and the
more negative they become,

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:90%
the more energy they get.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.153 align:middle line:10%
So people that make you mad,
you are contributing to them.

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But don't
they realize, Randy,

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
wrong with them, themselves?

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:90%
Don't they get it?

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: No.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:06.750 align:middle line:84%
They are not capable of
self-assessment, self-awareness

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:07.960 align:middle line:90%
at that level.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:12.270 align:middle line:10%
So Dr. David Hawkins wrote
a book, "Power VS Force",

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:10%
and he talks about this.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.920 align:middle line:10%
And he has a chart in there,
and most people misuse it.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at that
chart, under a certain level

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.680 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, he uses
200, those people are not

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.890 align:middle line:84%
capable of self-assessment
or self awareness,

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.960 align:middle line:84%
but they're involved
in a frequency band,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's an information
flow from the collective

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, or the universe,
whatever you want to call it,

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and what that does
is it locks them in.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm an angry person.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm an apathetic person.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm a depressed person.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm a guilty person
or shamed person.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:84%
These are all low level
negative consciousness.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:10%
And if you are above that, and
you get around those people,

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.350 align:middle line:10%
you generally have aversion.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:55.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be around that.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just automatic, but
it's automatic from a level

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.850 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and
nobody's ever explained that.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Why do you not want
to be around them?

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.365 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But that's a defensive
mechanism that our body has,

00:27:06.365 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's to
protect ourself.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes,
your self-protecting

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and self-supporting because you
need your life force to support

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:84%
your body, your existence,
your consciousness.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can somebody be so
powerful with a life force

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and an energy force, that not
even the psychic vampire can

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.220 align:middle line:90%
bother them?

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.400 align:middle line:84%
That they exude so much energy,
they don't even feel it?

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: OK, so
remember we said about 9 feet?

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Mhm.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Around 9 feet,
you start being less receptive,

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:42.080 align:middle line:84%
is the language, to illness,
to negative thinking,

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:90%
negative consciousness.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Being around positive people,
generally, a really positive

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.900 align:middle line:84%
person is not somebody
that broadcasts that.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.037 align:middle line:90%
They just have a presence.

00:27:52.037 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's just there.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They've got it.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: I'm healthy.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:55.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm present.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You can feel it
when they walk in the room.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.218 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:27:58.218 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And the ideal condition of a
human being is a two-year-old.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.860 align:middle line:10%
You look at the
energy around them.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.110 align:middle line:10%
They're born with a 30,
40, 50 foot energy field.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to pick them
up, hold them, buy them clothes,

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.480 align:middle line:90%
cart them around.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, I tell people, you to
be 21 and buy your own clothes,

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:90%
buy your own--

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.990 align:middle line:90%
nobody wants to hug you, right?

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's the phenomena, the
fact that your inner field has

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:21.620 align:middle line:90%
shrunk.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.280 align:middle line:10%
But if it's stayed the same,
oh wow, you're a charismatic.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:90%
You're a movie star.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:90%
You're somebody popular.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, it just
goes on and on, right?

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's why
people want to be

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.020 align:middle line:84%
around people that are positive
or have a big energy field.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people don't
want to be around people

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:39.470 align:middle line:90%
that negative energy field.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:90%
It's just a polarity balance.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.373 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What is
transdimensional interaction?

00:28:45.373 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
You ever dreamed?

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Many times.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So when we
talk about frequency bands,

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:84%
we can also talk
about dimensions,

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.380 align:middle line:84%
which is a language, I'm
not fond of by the way.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:84%
It's more of
information intersection

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:90%
which is a whole other subject.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:84%
But those information
intersections

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:90%
have their own reality.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you dream, there
was a study at Harvard,

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.320 align:middle line:84%
that you take your
senses with you.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I always like
poke somebody and go, hey, hey,

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:16.670 align:middle line:90%
where are you.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And they go, I was
somewhere else.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And that started off all my
interests and exploration

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:90%
into where did you go.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Like when you have a dream
state, where are you?

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:28.212 align:middle line:90%
You're in another dimension.

00:29:28.212 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're in
another world or something.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.670 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah, and it's
real because your senses are

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:36.008 align:middle line:10%
present, and you're able to
see, and hear, and react.

00:29:36.008 --> 00:29:37.550 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Oh, it's
like you're there.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.680 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah,
so that reality--

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.140 align:middle line:10%
and that led into what I
call zero and one reality.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Number one reality is the
physical reality we exist in,

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:47.870 align:middle line:90%
the one we interact with.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.360 align:middle line:90%
But zero reality is much bigger.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's the reality of
dreams, and imagination,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of things
that are non-physical.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.950 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean we
don't experience them.

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So experiential consciousness
works in both of them.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:09.980 align:middle line:10%
And I call when you go over
into transitional dimensions,

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.130 align:middle line:10%
you're interacting in an area
that you don't know the rules,

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.920 align:middle line:10%
you don't know the population,
you don't know anything,

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.745 align:middle line:10%
because have you ever
been afraid in a dream?

00:30:19.745 --> 00:30:20.870 align:middle line:90%
You ever fought in a dream.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, I think.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And fall, everything else.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Oh yeah,
and you're experiencing that

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.730 align:middle line:84%
the same way you
would in number one,

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:84%
except you're experiencing
it without the physical body.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.110 align:middle line:10%
And that becomes
another key point

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:10%
in my research about,
well, Tesla and Einstein,

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.380 align:middle line:10%
they all kept a notebook
beside their bed,

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:10%
and they would go
looking, or to some point,

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.390 align:middle line:10%
looking for that information.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things I've done is

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:52.010 align:middle line:84%
develop a GPS of all that
alternate reality they call it,

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:84%
all that dimensional
reality, because all

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:59.450 align:middle line:84%
that information that they used
and came to them was available.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:01.760 align:middle line:90%
It was already extant.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:84%
In some way, they didn't develop
relativity or Tesla's ideas

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.712 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetism.

00:31:06.712 --> 00:31:08.795 align:middle line:10%
They just went out there
and found the information

00:31:08.795 --> 00:31:10.905 align:middle line:10%
and brought it back
and expressed it.

00:31:10.905 --> 00:31:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it
worked for them?

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.572 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes, and it
works for a lot of people.

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:16.281 align:middle line:10%
And we can point to
it throughout history

00:31:16.281 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:10%
where these are
major revelations

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.230 align:middle line:10%
occur, right, and
then are dropped

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:23.457 align:middle line:10%
into human consciousness.

00:31:23.457 --> 00:31:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When we talk about
the true nature of reality,

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.800 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean to you?

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: That's
another book I've been writing

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:31.220 align:middle line:90%
for years and--

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Get it
done, would you.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.770 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: It's
called proximate reality,

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.450 align:middle line:10%
the theory of proximate,
approximate meaning

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:40.010 align:middle line:10%
what's around you.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Like how far you can reach.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So I can reach this chair,
and the floor, and things,

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.430 align:middle line:90%
those are proximate to me.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.380 align:middle line:84%
But I can't touch New
York City from right

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:84%
here, not physically,
but I can close my eyes

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.120 align:middle line:90%
and I can be there.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.850 align:middle line:84%
I can be there in my
imagination or I can actually

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.620 align:middle line:90%
be there with my presence.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, that gets into
some Tibetan techniques

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:84%
of bilocation and
things like that.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Episode 6
six of "Quantum Effect"

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:08.510 align:middle line:90%
talks about that.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:13.160 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: You only occupy
a very small point of reality.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:10%
I call this the theory
of proximate reality.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.300 align:middle line:10%
So proximate reality
means that the center

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:26.350 align:middle line:10%
of the universe, you, occupies
a very unique part of reality.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:30.710 align:middle line:10%
This theory explains that
your experiences are local,

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:10%
and you are confined
to how far you

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.110 align:middle line:10%
can reach with your presence.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.760 align:middle line:10%


00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.570 align:middle line:10%
Now, this reality
is situated away

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:42.831 align:middle line:10%
from the center of the
universe, which is you.

00:32:42.831 --> 00:32:46.630 align:middle line:10%
You exist as the
point of attachment

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.410 align:middle line:10%
to being yourself
in this reality.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:54.520 align:middle line:10%
The point of attachment
to this reality is you.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:33:00.790 align:middle line:10%
If you lose your point of
attachment, your body, you die.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:04.060 align:middle line:10%
So proximate reality is
the amount of reality

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:10.950 align:middle line:10%
that you are in contact with
or have a relationship with.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:14.220 align:middle line:10%
So if you expand
your consciousness,

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:19.115 align:middle line:10%
you are expanding the amount
of reality in your life.

00:33:19.115 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How many
people, Randy,

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:24.750 align:middle line:84%
actually take the
time to do that,

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.900 align:middle line:84%
to probe their inner
self like that?

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Not very many.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:30.180 align:middle line:90%
It literally--

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.305 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I don't think so.

00:33:31.305 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: It literally
becomes fewer and fewer,

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and I know that because
I've experienced it.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is, the more
you become involved

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.660 align:middle line:84%
in looking at all this,
it's like, number one,

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.490 align:middle line:90%
reality kind of disappears.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And you see this
and all the mystics

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and all the scientists
that get so involved

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:50.730 align:middle line:84%
in what's going on in
their consciousness

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:84%
or what's going on
in zero reality,

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.703 align:middle line:90%
that this one disappears.

00:33:54.703 --> 00:33:55.620 align:middle line:90%
We do it all the time.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.270 align:middle line:10%
That's what day dreaming is.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what creative
consciousness is.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Is that the more you involve
it, the more you remove yourself

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.980 align:middle line:90%
from this reality.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So so we have people that
operate in number one reality,

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.199 align:middle line:84%
and these are observations,
not judgments.

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:16.170 align:middle line:84%
But construction and things
like that, you're intimately

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:18.840 align:middle line:90%
involved with physical reality.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have people that
are creatives, or say design,

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and architects, that
are involved in zero.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.300 align:middle line:84%
They're pulling it out of
the collective consciousness,

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're pulling out
of the field itself,

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.130 align:middle line:84%
the information field
that we're surrounded in.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:39.239 align:middle line:84%
So the theory of proximate
reality deals with--

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll go ahead and
explain the set theory.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.739 align:middle line:90%
We have a reference set.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Your reference set right
now is we're in Boulder.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And you fly tomorrow,
you're somewhere else.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, you've
been in both places,

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.159 align:middle line:90%
now you have preferences.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Which one do you like?

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So this goes on constantly where
we're exploring our reference.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're
making preferences.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, we get
into organization.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:84%
We organize ourselves
about living in LA

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:07.590 align:middle line:90%
or living in Boulder.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And then, it just keeps going.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:11.790 align:middle line:90%
There's like five subsets.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And really with
those, we can start

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:18.870 align:middle line:84%
explaining what reality is
much more to a greater degree

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:20.640 align:middle line:90%
than it is what it.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Is

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: To you, what is
the human energy field?

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.526 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:35:27.526 --> 00:35:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: It's
the source of life,

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.142 align:middle line:84%
but it's the source
of life as an outcome.

00:35:34.142 --> 00:35:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And we all have it?

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:36.225 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:35:36.225 --> 00:35:40.480 align:middle line:84%
If you're alive, the source
of life is an outcome for you

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.620 align:middle line:90%
because you're alive.

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And once you get away from that
source or disconnect from it,

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:46.990 align:middle line:90%
you're not alive.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So the human energy
field is very simple.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Its energy flows-- current
flows through any wire.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.600 align:middle line:84%
It creates an
electromagnetic field.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the human
being, it's the spine,

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and the energy flows
up and down the spine.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.510 align:middle line:84%
In Sanskrit it's called
Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:11.310 align:middle line:84%
They refer to circuits or
channels of energy flow.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And as a flow up and down,
they create an energy field.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you have a
remarkable way of talking about

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.630 align:middle line:90%
it in "Quantum Effect".

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.820 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Most
people lack energy,

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:27.580 align:middle line:10%
and are unable to maintain an
optimal existence in reality.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.840 align:middle line:10%
Lack of energy manifests as
illness, problems, and issues.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.430 align:middle line:10%
They show up in the body
as internal conflict

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.915 align:middle line:10%
when your energy doesn't
match the incoming energy

00:36:38.915 --> 00:36:40.810 align:middle line:10%
or information.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:43.990 align:middle line:10%
All functions of the body
operate on electron flow,

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.980 align:middle line:10%
on energy.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.470 align:middle line:10%
If you don't have enough,
then these systems

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:50.080 align:middle line:10%
experience phenomena
similar to having

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.630 align:middle line:10%
a dimmer switch on
that particular aspect

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:54.400 align:middle line:10%
of your existence.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.710 align:middle line:84%
In an article published by
the University of Maryland

00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:01.080 align:middle line:84%
recently, they talk about
energy in the body this way.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.910 align:middle line:84%
The elements in our body, like
sodium, potassium, calcium,

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and magnesium, have a
specific electrical charge.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:13.480 align:middle line:10%
This is the chemical basis for
life that they're promoting.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.710 align:middle line:10%
Almost all of our cells can use
these charged elements, called

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:21.310 align:middle line:10%
ions, to generate electricity.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:25.540 align:middle line:10%
That is true, but there's
also outside energy flows

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:30.790 align:middle line:10%
that also contribute to
our overall energy content.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.160 align:middle line:10%
The contents of the
cell are protected

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:37.660 align:middle line:10%
from the outside environment
by a cell membrane.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Our energy field is protected
by a similar membrane.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I have given it the
name of a event horizon.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:10%
Just like your skin is the limit
of your physical existence,

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.870 align:middle line:10%
your event horizon,
the absolute limit

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:56.230 align:middle line:10%
of your electronic or
electromagnetic field,

00:37:56.230 --> 00:38:00.910 align:middle line:10%
is also a barrier to other
information or other energy

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:03.010 align:middle line:10%
flows.

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.650 align:middle line:10%
The cell membrane is
made up of lipids,

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:09.070 align:middle line:10%
and they create a barrier
that only certain substances

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:14.090 align:middle line:10%
can cross to reach
the cell interior.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.790 align:middle line:10%
Why don't we think of the human
body and the human energy field

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:18.080 align:middle line:10%
in the same way?

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.600 align:middle line:10%
Why wouldn't we set
up our energy field

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.340 align:middle line:10%
and do practices that allow for
the energetic interaction that

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:10%
occurs at the limit of our
energy field to be selective,

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:10%
and to not allow that
which is destructive,

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:10%
whether it be a flu
virus, or whether it

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.250 align:middle line:10%
be a negative thought?

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.442 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What is the
unified energy field, Randy?

00:38:40.442 --> 00:38:42.650 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Well,
science came up with a concept

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:46.730 align:middle line:10%
of unified field theory to be
able to explain all the actions

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:52.220 align:middle line:10%
of matter, even in
its smallest forms.

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But humans are much more
than Higgs boson particles.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: We better be.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.855 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah, and
one of the things that came up

00:38:58.855 --> 00:39:03.590 align:middle line:84%
to me was does Higgs bosons have
consciousness or consciousness

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Higgs bosons?

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a very
simple question.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:11.750 align:middle line:84%
But what you're asking
is what is life force

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and where does it fit into
this unified field theory?

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And so, quantum
physics kind of steps

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.340 align:middle line:84%
out there to give us an
opening to look at that.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But again, it
doesn't explain it.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.420 align:middle line:90%
It's incapable of explaining.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So now we have all the physics
we have, relativity and quantum

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:33.770 align:middle line:84%
physics, quantum
mechanics, and yet, they're

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.970 align:middle line:84%
all insufficient to
explain life force.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:37.617 align:middle line:90%
So we need another physics.

00:39:37.617 --> 00:39:39.700 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've been
working on for 30, 40 years.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does It all tie-in
to everything that we've done,

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.940 align:middle line:84%
psychic abilities, astral
projection, remote viewing,

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.900 align:middle line:90%
consciousness?

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Is it all tied into one?

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes, and
those are aspects of life that

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.600 align:middle line:90%
science ignores.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.420 align:middle line:90%
They poo-poo it.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.330 align:middle line:84%
They say there's
no validity to it.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The only validity in a
human life is experiential.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:84%
It's your consciousness
and what you go through.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.173 align:middle line:84%
People say what's
the purpose of life.

00:40:08.173 --> 00:40:09.440 align:middle line:90%
To be you.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.910 align:middle line:90%
What's your purpose in life?

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Being you, to be alive.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are
base level programming

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.980 align:middle line:84%
is to sustain life,
to promote life.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:23.040 align:middle line:10%
That's why in consciousness when
you see people destroying life,

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.250 align:middle line:10%
whether it's human,
or animal, or plant,

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:29.510 align:middle line:10%
it's like that's kind of
wrong at certain level,

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:34.448 align:middle line:10%
because there's a feedback
mechanism of negativity that's

00:40:34.448 --> 00:40:36.240 align:middle line:10%
going to affect you
and affect your health.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh my god.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:middle line:90%
In a big way too.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, people that are evil,
people that do things that are

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:46.310 align:middle line:84%
destructive, tend to have health
issues we say much more than

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.210 align:middle line:90%
people who don't.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you believe
in extraterrestrial life?

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.935 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they practicing
the same thing we should be

00:40:53.935 --> 00:40:55.040 align:middle line:90%
practicing?

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Well, the
problem becomes like if we look

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:04.220 align:middle line:84%
at extra dimensional
dimensions, intersections,

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.120 align:middle line:90%
those have populations.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And so, everything from
ghosts to extraterrestrials

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:13.550 align:middle line:84%
has an environment,
they have a reality,

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:17.540 align:middle line:84%
they have a dimension,
a realm, a domain.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have all
these names, and I

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:21.620 align:middle line:84%
use a lot of computer
language for that reason.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They may be
from that dimension.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:23.970 align:middle line:90%
Who knows, right?

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes, and
we don't know the extent.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if you get
kicked out of your body

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.820 align:middle line:84%
through drugs, or
getting hit in the head,

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.880 align:middle line:90%
or a mystical experience?

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like you may end up in
one of these other dimensions.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:39.290 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody says
there's no such thing as ETs,

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:40.740 align:middle line:90%
how do you know that?

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And why would you
think they exist

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.720 align:middle line:90%
in the same reality we do?

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's about 28 to
30 intersections that make up

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.710 align:middle line:90%
that humans interact with.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:52.880 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.260 align:middle line:84%
ET maybe in 40 or 50, and
there's language for that

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.230 align:middle line:90%
that I developed.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:01.310 align:middle line:10%
But, yes, why wouldn't
there be consciousness,

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.470 align:middle line:10%
and why wouldn't it
exist all over the place?

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.030 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: And I'm sure there is.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.330 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: There is, yes.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.580 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: There's no doubt it.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.500 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So yes,
ET exists in the sense that

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.820 align:middle line:10%
there's a reality to it, and
there's a reality somewhere.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.190 align:middle line:90%
And remember the intersections?

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Mhm.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.282 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: You're
intersection with other people,

00:42:18.282 --> 00:42:21.380 align:middle line:84%
with people, places,
and things, right,

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and your continued interaction
develops your ability to be

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.690 align:middle line:84%
cognizant of it,
to be aware of it.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Remember integrated,
synchronized, congruent.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So when people say they
talked to ET, yes, they did.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.930 align:middle line:84%
When people say they saw pink
elephants, yes, they did.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:42.260 align:middle line:84%
When people describe events
that haven't happened yet,

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.610 align:middle line:84%
like in remote viewing,
yes, that exists.

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Does it exist here?

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.120 align:middle line:90%
No, not yet.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we divided
up into zero and number one

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.800 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.967 align:middle line:90%
You can have these thoughts.

00:42:55.967 --> 00:42:57.450 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
end of the world,

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.890 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't exist here yet.

00:42:58.890 --> 00:42:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yet.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.273 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: It
exists over there.

00:43:01.273 --> 00:43:02.540 align:middle line:90%
ET exists over there.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Does it exist here?

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Yes, without getting into
personal experiences,

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.550 align:middle line:84%
yours or mine, because I
know all kinds of people

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:11.810 align:middle line:90%
have had those experiences.

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do you train
people to boost their energy

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:16.200 align:middle line:90%
field?

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
The book "Warday".

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.870 align:middle line:84%
It started out as just a simple
little book of five things

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:23.190 align:middle line:90%
you do every day.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And what it's doing,
is just like you have

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.120 align:middle line:90%
a cup of coffee in the morning.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.680 align:middle line:10%
You're going to
increase the size

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.610 align:middle line:10%
of your electromagnetic field.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And I tried it out
on a client I have.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.170 align:middle line:90%
She's 81 years old of time.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And she went from having
no energy field to having

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:39.700 align:middle line:90%
about a 30 foot energy field.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: 30?

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And she is
a force to be reckoned with.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean like--

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: She's a pistol.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.448 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Oh god, yes.

00:43:46.448 --> 00:43:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is, the
increase in the energy field

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:53.100 align:middle line:84%
has resulted in the expansion
of her consciousness.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So she's very aware
of the information

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about, much
more than she was before we

00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:59.790 align:middle line:90%
increased the energy field.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And she did it to herself.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I gave her the
exercises in support

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:05.490 align:middle line:90%
of what I was doing with her.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.650 align:middle line:10%
And if you knew
her whole story, I

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:11.220 align:middle line:10%
mean we're talking marriages,
and children, and--

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.530 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Ups and downs.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
Yeah, a typical life,

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.440 align:middle line:84%
but she's one of the
healthiest people I know.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.792 align:middle line:90%
83 years old now, 84.

00:44:17.792 --> 00:44:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's the
single thing, Randy,

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:23.920 align:middle line:84%
you would like people
to learn from your work?

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: To
sit theirselves down,

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:31.500 align:middle line:84%
remove all inputs, TV,
radio, people, things.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.560 align:middle line:90%
It's contemplative meditation.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.340 align:middle line:84%
It's to be able to see if
you can just be George.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.095 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can everyone
increase their energy?

00:44:41.095 --> 00:44:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:46.290 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I have PTSD clients.

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.300 align:middle line:90%
I've had schizophrenic clients.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I've had-- and all of them when
you increase the energy, you

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:53.430 align:middle line:90%
also increase consciousness.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they're
cured, basically?

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: They are
treated because ultimately--

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.147 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We don't use the
cure word I guess, do we?

00:45:00.147 --> 00:45:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes, ultimately
your future is determined

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.120 align:middle line:90%
by you and what's available.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What would you say,
based on your experience,

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:16.370 align:middle line:84%
is the single biggest issue
some person has with themselves?

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: I think it's
been involved too much in zero

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:19.850 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And what
is zero reality?

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Their thinking.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Their connection to
their thoughts literally,

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.560 align:middle line:84%
because thinking
will wear you out.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.230 align:middle line:84%
You can sit all day
long and be so tired,

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:36.300 align:middle line:84%
it's just like you'd
been pouring concrete

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.590 align:middle line:90%
all day or something.

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So the absence of
the self, the absence

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:46.560 align:middle line:84%
of the essence of a person
present in your physical body

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.250 align:middle line:84%
results in the
absence of the energy.

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It results in, ultimately,
you not being yourself,

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:55.860 align:middle line:90%
not have an energy.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.720 align:middle line:90%
It's like video game players.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.600 align:middle line:84%
They're in high alpha
states off the charts,

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.450 align:middle line:90%
and they're not here.

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:04.200 align:middle line:84%
You can sit there and
throw things at them

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and they're playing
around with their game.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a conscious
state as opposed

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:12.360 align:middle line:84%
to an unconscious state, like
in dream states and things

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.420 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But once you remove
yourself from the balance

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:20.180 align:middle line:84%
of zero and one, you
have problems either way.

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:23.220 align:middle line:84%
In number one reality, you're
not aware of your surroundings

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.800 align:middle line:90%
as much as you should be.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.510 align:middle line:84%
In zero reality, you're not
aware of-- you see what I mean?

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.100 align:middle line:10%
It just goes back and forth.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.420 align:middle line:10%
So ultimately, balance.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why that duality
of reality thing

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
is that you should

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.950 align:middle line:90%
have a balance in your life.

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:40.050 align:middle line:10%
You should be involved
in the physical,

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:42.900 align:middle line:10%
and you should be involved in
your imagination, creativity,

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.960 align:middle line:10%
and being George.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.420 align:middle line:10%
What does it mean to be George?

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.630 align:middle line:10%
It's things you do when you're
not working, when you're not

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.850 align:middle line:10%
in a relationship, right?

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.022 align:middle line:90%
That's being yourself.

00:46:53.022 --> 00:46:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Randy, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:56.688 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
Thank you, George.

00:46:56.688 --> 00:46:58.545 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate being able
to talk about this.

00:46:58.545 --> 00:46:59.670 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Well, every day--

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:03.330 align:middle line:10%
every day you do this in your
Gaia program "Quantum Effect",

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:04.560 align:middle line:10%
which is worth watching.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.380 align:middle line:10%
Just sit down and watch
it for an entire weekend.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.500 align:middle line:10%
It will really help you.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.020 align:middle line:90%
