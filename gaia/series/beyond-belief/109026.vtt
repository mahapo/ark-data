00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.200 align:middle line:84%
MAN: And I think many
people today don't

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.225 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:12.405 align:middle line:84%
MAN: People are basically
[INAUDIBLE] to help them

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:13.370 align:middle line:90%
cover what really happened.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
WOMAN: I felt like
something was watching me.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.416 align:middle line:84%
MAN: We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.290 align:middle line:10%
We're going to scare
the living daylights out

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:10%
of view with Paul Eno.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:10%
He's a parallel investigator.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:10%
He and his son Ben have been
doing this for a long time.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:84%
They've got their
own radio show.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about that as well.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And you just love the
unusual, don't you?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I think I do.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I got that from my father, who
also loved the unusual, George.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that how it started for you?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, as a
matter of fact, yes.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.910 align:middle line:10%
He had a scrapbook
of everything weird

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:10%
that happened in the
1940s, '50s, and '60s.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:10%
But the real clincher
was in 1961--

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.350 align:middle line:10%
and it took me a long time to
be able to talk about this--

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:10%
was that he took his own life.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:90%
And I was there.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.193 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Oh, sorry to hear that.

00:01:03.193 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:90%
I was seven years old.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a Catholic
school at the time.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you did things like
eating hot dogs on Fridays

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.754 align:middle line:84%
or committing suicide,
you went to hell.

00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:12.619 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: You don't do that.

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this
wonderful man who

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
was home with me because
he'd had heart problems

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:90%
went to hell?

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And that just-- I
couldn't believe that.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So years later, I
entered the seminary.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And I began to wonder
about the doctrine

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.667 align:middle line:84%
of purgatory, Roman
Catholic doctrine.

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
If you're not quite
good enough to go

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:84%
to heaven, and not quite
bad enough to go to hell,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.333 align:middle line:90%
you went to Purgatory.

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:84%
You're like in
limbo, sort of, right?

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.610 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I wondered, you
know, is this maybe

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:84%
what's behind our
notion of ghosts,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
which are experienced in all
cultures throughout history.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.037 align:middle line:84%
And I said, is my father
maybe in purgatory?

00:01:50.037 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he wasn't even a Roman
Catholic, but what the hey.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So I started just--
that's what got me

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:90%
going in paranormal research.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And my first case was a
result of that question.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Are ghosts really
souls in purgatory?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And I got answers
I never expected.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:84%
When you were seven years
old and this tragedy occurred,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
did you know what
had happened then,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
or did your mother tell
you later on in life?

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, I kind of knew what was--
I wasn't-- well, I don't want

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.479 align:middle line:84%
to get into the gory details.
GEORGE: I understand.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
what was happening.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I turned and went to
a friend's house instead.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Back when seven-year-olds could
walk safely down the street.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And I've had to live
with that my whole life.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really the background

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:84%
to my quest to find
out what's really

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:90%
going on in the paranormal.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever communicated
with him on the other side?

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
That is a pregnant
question, obviously.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's the
right question, George.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I love you dearly,
but I don't know

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:90%
if that's the right question.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.257 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:90%
If we ask the wrong questions--

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Rephrase it.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Are you still with your
father, rather than,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:90%
is your father still with you?

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into what I
learned over a number of cases,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and how I learned that
the spiritualist approach,

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with
spirits of dead people

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:84%
when we're dealing with ghosts,
I don't believe that anymore.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I think it's far deeper
and far more interesting.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, am
I still with my father?

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think, yes, in
many, many parallel worlds

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:84%
where he never died, he's been
a real presence in my life.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have hauntings and
poltergeists after the suicide.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Very peaceful.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I have dealt with
a lot of suicides,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:90%
and that's usually not the case.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a matter
of him-- it's all us,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:90%
in all these parallel realities.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:84%
We're getting a
little ahead, maybe.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's all us.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:90%
We're one super being.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're with him
in many worlds.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not that he's
here, but we're there.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's all real.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Amazingly real.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
The media is really
beginning to get

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:90%
interested in this field.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:84%
We just had the story just a few
days ago of a boy in Cleveland

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.320 align:middle line:84%
who apparently had
died for 20 minutes.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And he says he saw Jesus.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus told him, don't
worry, you'll be OK.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And then he revived.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's a
figment of his imagination,

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
or if that's his brain reacting
with lack of oxygen or what.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But doctors confirmed his
heart stopped for 20 minutes,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and he comes out with
this incredible story.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing television programs
devoted to the supernatural

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:90%
and life after death.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:90%
What's going on, Paul?

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Why so much?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we're seeing a
decline of organized religion.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And that was where people
went when they wanted to know,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:90%
am I going to be OK?

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Because really, that's
the ultimate question.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:84%
When you get to your
deathbed, your bank accounts,

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
business affairs,
none of that's really

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.330 align:middle line:90%
going to matter in the end.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.363 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Nothing means anything.

00:04:52.363 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:90%
It's, am I going to be OK?

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And are my loved
ones going to be OK?

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
People used to go to
that for religion.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
But now, I think they're
turning to the paranormal more

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and more, which may be a good
idea, or it might not be,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot
of misinformation.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So but I really
think-- and yeah,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about this many
times-- parallel worlds, which

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:84%
are accepted in physics,
usually in one way or another,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:84%
are really responsible
for a lot of these,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
or if not all
paranormal experiences.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking one thing, if
I may just go into something.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
An event much like
that with an adult,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:84%
he would usually call
it-- we would usually call

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:90%
it a near death experience.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Right.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.110 align:middle line:90%
He was on an operating table.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
But what happened to him
is something I've run

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:90%
into on a number of occasions.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.050 align:middle line:90%
I call it the flashing nexus.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.061 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about that.
PAUL: OK.

00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:84%
-What is that?
-All right.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:90%
He lay there.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And instead of sort
of being above,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.530 align:middle line:84%
there's a little bit of
being above the table

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:90%
looking down on himself.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.420 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden,
he was the doctor.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
he was one of the nurses.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And then he was a guy
sitting out in the hallway.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.780 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what is this about?

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:90%
And he was on our show.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, you
experienced the flashing nexus.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately,
we're not only

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
one super person across
all these worlds--

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.110 align:middle line:90%
not all the worlds.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:90%
We're not in every one.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:90%
But all possibilities exist.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
physics seems to say.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything that can be will be,
was, could be, really exists.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was that nurse
in a parallel world,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
or-- it's all sort
of simultaneous.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And he is the doctor
in a parallel world.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
experienced that.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:84%
The problem with that
is that in our society,

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.360 align:middle line:84%
they're going to call
you schizophrenic.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.091 align:middle line:84%
Or they're going to
try to medicate you.

00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, they are.
Precisely.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And I learned-- when
I was in the seminary,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I worked in several psychiatric
hospitals in the ward,

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:84%
ostensibly in a
pastoral capacity.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was working with
a priest was an exorcist.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And we were taking
care some of that when

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:90%
the doctors just couldn't--

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.646 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: A real life exorcist?

00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Yes, when the doctors
couldn't handle it.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's another story.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
But I was dealing
with people who

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:90%
were supposedly schizophrenic.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:84%
But they were-- and I'd
stake my life on it.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
They were living in
worlds that were real.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
terrible worlds,

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:84%
but others-- and our
society can't deal

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:90%
with but one world of the time.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they were, as you say,
medicated, and a lot of them

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:90%
were in-patients.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:84%
More in-patients in the
'70s than there are now.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
But I think they were
more aware than we are.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But you have to keep
your feet on the ground,

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.931 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to
end up like that.

00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.790 align:middle line:84%
This is reality
in our experience.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Paul, this quest of ours,
this need to find out what's

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, does
it exist after I die,

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:84%
has been around since
the beginning of man.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
At this point in your
life and career--

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and you've investigated
many cases.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about some
of them on the program today.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
What have you concluded
about what it might be?

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is
no single other side.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:84%
I began asking myself,
why do we see ghosts

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:90%
in clothes, driving cars?

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Why did I stand in those
woods in Connecticut

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.650 align:middle line:84%
in that first case in
1971 and hear an ox cart

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
going by, the guy yelling,
yah, cracking a whip,

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:90%
and not seeing anything?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Seven of us witnessed this.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said because the other
side is actually billions

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:90%
and billions of other sides.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe an infinite
number of other sides,

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:84%
in many of which we
ourselves live, perhaps

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:84%
in some other form and
as some other person,

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:84%
I think that
explains everything,

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
and that's the interpretation
of quantum mechanics

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
that we sort of embrace, and
that many physicists embrace.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:90%
So many, many other sides.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.114 align:middle line:84%
Physical, just as physical is
here, although in other forms--

00:08:45.114 --> 00:08:45.880 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: In other forms.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.260 align:middle line:84%
There could be ones that
are like spirits, I suppose.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think we interpret
things in the way

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.370 align:middle line:90%
that we most easily understand.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And to take the idea
of quantum mechanics

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and parallel worlds,
that could be

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:84%
tough on our limited
understanding.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I think our remote
ancestors understand.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Understood it.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
go back-- well, I

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:84%
did a study of the Nicobar
and Andaman Islanders

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
in the Indian Ocean,
whose tradition

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.921 align:middle line:84%
goes back over 100,000 years.
Living tradition.

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That's a long time.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a long time.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:84%
This is what they
believe, if you talk

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.950 align:middle line:90%
about it in a practical way.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Shamans.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I dealt with one in
Australia and one in Quebec.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:90%
Cree and aboriginal.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:90%
He told me the same things.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.056 align:middle line:90%
Said, you're on the right track.

00:09:31.056 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:90%
And then there's--

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: And isn't
it strange how all

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.420 align:middle line:84%
those different cultures seem
to focus in on the same thing?

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: Exactly.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But we interpret it in
our narrow paradigm,

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
our Western way of thinking,
where we have to pigeonhole

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:84%
everything, and make sure
that we can understand it,

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:90%
whether we understand it or not.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.811 align:middle line:84%
And we come out with a sort of
two-dimensional spiritualist

00:09:52.811 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:90%
kind of approach.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And don't want to insult
anybody who's a spiritualist,

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:90%
but I don't believe it that way.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Religions would hate you.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.270 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: Well, I am not too
popular amongst some of them.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.170 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, there
are some priests and nuns

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
of the orthodox variety who
will say they listen to our show

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.344 align:middle line:84%
because they say, that's the
way we kind of look at it.

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:12.310 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That's the way it is.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Which kind of intrigued me.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you think
religions originally

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:84%
started because they
wanted to control

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.735 align:middle line:90%
us in this physical life?

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And so you talk about, you
must be good, you must do this,

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.760 align:middle line:90%
stay out of hell.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, religion is an
interesting question.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
That brings us to the question
of science versus religion.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, with our remote ancestors,
had there been no questions,

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.370 align:middle line:84%
had there been no contact
with what they believed

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
were supernatural beings,
there would have been no need

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.070 align:middle line:90%
for religion or for science.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Because you wouldn't have
had to explain everything.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think that religion and
science started together.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.760 align:middle line:84%
They have the same
mother, the paranormal.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And they have been on
really parallel paths

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:90%
ever since the beginning.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Only recently have
they come into-- people

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:84%
don't realize that, that
they really weren't at odds.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So religion, I think,
was hijacked by the worst

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:90%
part of human nature at times.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
denigrate all of it,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
because it works
for many people.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And it can be very,
very positive.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.080 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say that
it can be very negative.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.990 align:middle line:84%
In many of the cases we worked
with, some of the nastiest

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.630 align:middle line:84%
ones, the people were very
devout and devoted to a rather

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:84%
negative-- well, let's
just use the old time

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Roman Catholic
spirituality as an example,

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:90%
what I grew up with.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:90%
And it was feeding these things.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.240 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't fighting them.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:90%
It was feeding them.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:90%
In my opinion.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it depends
how you use it.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
It can be positive.
It can be negative.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Paul, let's get
into that Connecticut

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.080 align:middle line:84%
case, which was really your
first big case, wasn't it?

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.625 align:middle line:84%
Well, other than
the one with the ox

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
cart driving whipping
his horse, and yelling,

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:90%
and not being seen.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:90%
This was a big one in 1974.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:10%
I was working with Ed and
Lorraine Warren, of all people.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.780 align:middle line:10%
GEORGE: Ed is no longer with.
PAUL: No, no.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.760 align:middle line:10%
He died a few years ago.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:10%
GEORGE: At least on this plane.
-That's right.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.004 align:middle line:84%
On some parallel world, he's
still kicking, and carrying on,

00:12:01.004 --> 00:12:01.770 align:middle line:90%
and doing great things.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.040 align:middle line:90%
Doing his thing.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But Lorraine is
advanced in years.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm out of touch with
them since the 1970s.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.340 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, what happened
was I was down on the way

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:84%
to their house on a certain
Sunday in November of 1974.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I was on vacation
from the seminary.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:90%
And Lorraine, fabulous cook.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.501 align:middle line:84%
Looking forward to dinner
with Ed and Lorraine.

00:12:21.501 --> 00:12:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, I never got my
dinner, because when

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I got to the house, she came
leaping out the door and said,

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.940 align:middle line:84%
are you in a high
spiritual state right now?

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the red flag for
something's coming down.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Off we go into Bridgeport,
and this case was

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:90%
well documented in the press.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
We were getting calls
from as far away

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:90%
as Australia from journalists.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.170 align:middle line:10%
And the whole city--
Bridgeport is not a small town.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.430 align:middle line:10%
GEORGE: It's not a small town.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: And the place
was upside down.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
There were up to 10,000 people
gathered outside that house

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.157 align:middle line:90%
at any one time, so I was told.

00:12:49.157 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: What happened?

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, we went in
after it had begun.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:84%
There had been pounding on the
walls for months before this.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Strange things were happening.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And I've often found that
when a poltergeist begins,

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:90%
it starts slowly.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Then it'll [INAUDIBLE] then.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And as people get more annoyed,
more frightened, more angry,

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:90%
it gets more energy.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:90%
It gets more to eat.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And hence, our modern
idea of parasites, but I

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:90%
didn't know that then.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.390 align:middle line:90%
So what we did was to go in.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And it took a while for us to
get-- it sort of has to accept

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.695 align:middle line:90%
you into its chemical mix.

00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And the place was a mess.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Something had been
wheeling the little girl's

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:90%
baby carriage around.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
This was a couple
in their 40's with

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.460 align:middle line:90%
a 10-year-old adopted child.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was filled with
clothes, this baby carriage.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Religious objects-- this is an
example of Roman Catholic kind

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
of negative spirituality
in my opinion.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Religious objects have
been torn from the walls,

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.780 align:middle line:90%
thrown to the floor.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Knives had come out
of the kitchen drawer.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Whoa.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.770 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Yeah.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.361 align:middle line:84%
I can handle religious
artifacts being flown around,

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:50.060 align:middle line:90%
but not knives.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
But not knives flying
around the kitchen.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that
I heard was several hours

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:84%
after we got there, and there
were police and firefighters.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And we stood there and
watched a 300 pound

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.035 align:middle line:84%
refrigerator lift up off
the floor, turnaround,

00:14:02.035 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and set itself back down.
-How high up?

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:90%
A couple inches?

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Three feet or so.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:90%
Three feet?

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Police officers on one side of
me, firefighters on the other.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.981 align:middle line:84%
-And everybody's watching this?
-Oh yeah.

00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Oh, this was in their reports.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:90%
The official police reports.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: This is big.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So then, all of a sudden,
you hear this huge crash.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And an enormous chest of drawers
in the little girl's room

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:84%
flew across the room
and hit the wall.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And things just sort
of took off from there.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't get any sleep.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get anything to eat.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And the Warrens had left
to go do an interview.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.395 align:middle line:90%
And all you wanted was dinner.

00:14:35.395 --> 00:14:36.811 align:middle line:84%
-All I wanted was dinner.
-That was it.

00:14:36.811 --> 00:14:39.017 align:middle line:84%
Right?
So I got more than that.

00:14:39.017 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:90%
So I never get anything to eat.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I was standing
with the little girl

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.200 align:middle line:90%
in a corner of the living room.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Very small house.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And there was a reporter from
the "Bridgeport Post," John

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.690 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE], there
was a neighbor,

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and they were Mr. and Mrs.
[INAUDIBLE], was their name.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And the little girl
and I were reading

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
a prayer from an orthodox prayer
book, just in praise of Christ.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.660 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a kind of exorcism
or anything like this.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.360 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Right.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Weren't trying to
chase out anything?

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And Father Bill Sharpener,
the priest who was involved,

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and the Warrens,
and I were sitting

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:84%
around waiting for the
Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.379 align:middle line:84%
to agree to an exorcism.
GEORGE: OK.

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Which they never did.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're kicking
around, listening

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:90%
to all this stuff happening.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Meanwhile,
people were outside.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.760 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: People are gathering
outside with the police

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.410 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, something
happened in the kitchen.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
You could look down
the hallway and see

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.300 align:middle line:84%
almost these gauzy structures
taking shape, coming

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:90%
out of the little girl's room.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Goodman, who said he had
wanted to be a priest at one

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:84%
time, and had a beautiful
bass voice, like you do,

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.612 align:middle line:84%
started chanting in
Latin in the kitchen.

00:15:41.612 --> 00:15:43.610 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Did he know Latin?

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: Well, that's
what I asked him.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.810 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, you know,
I used to be an altar boy.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, so was I,
but I had to study five

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:90%
years of the bloody stuff--

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.093 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I went to catechism,
and I don't know Latin.

00:15:52.093 --> 00:15:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.924 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, so he came
back into the room.

00:15:54.924 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to figure that.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And then these four things.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a graphic
on the screen here

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:90%
now about these four things.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:84%
They didn't look like what
they look like in the graphic.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.784 align:middle line:84%
But there was one point
where one came up to me.

00:16:08.784 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I could tell it was trying
to get to the little girl.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.430 align:middle line:90%
I put her behind me.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I instinctively
pushed against it.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:90%
I felt a physical structure.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I felt skeletal
structure, which it

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:84%
looked kind of like the
illustrations in the diagram

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.210 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It pushed back, got around me,
and through the little girl

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.170 align:middle line:90%
across the room.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, the
energy in that house,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:84%
it felt like if you lit a
fuse, it would have exploded.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.450 align:middle line:90%
So I pulled everybody out.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:90%
We went out onto the sidewalk.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.297 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, the police had
quartered off the streets.

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Because we would
have walked right

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the crowd.
GEORGE: Right.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.339 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And no cell phones, of
course, in these times.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.805 align:middle line:84%
I ran next door to use the
phone to call the Warrens

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:90%
and ask them to come back.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.580 align:middle line:90%
And something followed me.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.750 align:middle line:84%
There was a knock-- after
I went into the house,

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:84%
the little boy said,
Mom, the priest

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.770 align:middle line:90%
wants to use the telephone.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:57.513 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't a priest.

00:16:57.513 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle line:90%
I was just a seminary student.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.259 align:middle line:84%
-Were you in a garment?
-No, no.

00:17:00.259 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Just ordinary clothes.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Father [INAUDIBLE]
was in-- but he wasn't

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:90%
there either at this point.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.359 align:middle line:84%
So I went in,
called the Warrens.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Took them an hour to
get back 10 miles,

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:84%
to get back into the city
because of all this chaos.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:84%
Something pounded on the door
after I went into the house,

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and the little boy said, Mommy,
there's nobody at the door.

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Because they open in there.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
I said, you want
to make a bet kids?

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.829 align:middle line:90%
So off I went.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.089 align:middle line:84%
And when we went back into the
house, when the Warrens came,

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:28.079 align:middle line:84%
things had calmed down,
and the radio was on,

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and they were speculating about
why we had left the house.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:90%
So this went on.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:90%
So the next day was Tuesday.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Warrens had
to go do something.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But we had gone to their
house for a few hours just

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:90%
to get some sleep.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go back to
Hartford to my house, just

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.900 align:middle line:90%
to take a shower and stuff.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So I'm listening to WCBS in
New York, and all of a sudden,

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:84%
they said, oh, the police have
declared this Bridgeport hoax

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to be a hoax.
This Bridgeport ghost.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.919 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That's what they said.

00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:90%
That's what they said.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I said, wait a minute.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.037 align:middle line:84%
And just before I left,
the little girl hugged me,

00:17:58.037 --> 00:17:58.870 align:middle line:90%
and the mother hugged me.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. [INAUDIBLE] said,
make sure you come back.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Please come back.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.054 align:middle line:90%
And then we hear this.

00:18:03.054 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:90%
So I went back about 2 o'clock--

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.321 align:middle line:84%
And nobody was talking
hoax when you were there?

00:18:06.321 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: Of course not.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't stand there with
police and firefighters

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and watch huge things
floating through the air,

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.460 align:middle line:90%
and some little kid doing it.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, give me a break.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:90%
So we went back at 2 o'clock.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I was thrown off the
property by a police officer.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.497 align:middle line:84%
So Ed Warren and I
were on the radio--

00:18:21.497 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Did he
know who you were--

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.424 align:middle line:84%
That's why he threw
me off the property.

00:18:24.424 --> 00:18:25.123 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:18:25.123 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:84%
They thought you
were rabble-rouser.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.195 align:middle line:84%
The hoaxer.
-Yeah.

00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So Ed Warren and I were on the
radio for a couple of days,

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.350 align:middle line:84%
battling back and
forth with the police.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the whole
thing descended into chaos.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And all we heard later on was
that the little girl had been

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:84%
taken to Fairfield
Psychiatric State Hospital,

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:84%
which mercifully now is closed.
GEORGE: Right.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Ghost hunters go in there now.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's still
things happening.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I heard they had to
sink their Christmas

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
tree in concrete
at Christmas time,

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:90%
because it kept floating around.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.080 align:middle line:90%
But that's a hoax.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING] Right.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Perpetrated by a
10-year-old child.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: Unbelievable.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.775 align:middle line:84%
So a new book has been written
about this by Bill Hall.

00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It just came out last year, "The
World's Most Haunted House."

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And great book, and he
really gets it right.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Is the
house still there?

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:10.796 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: It's still there.

00:19:10.796 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah.
Little place.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:90%
You'd never suspect.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Same family?
Or are they--

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:14.980 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: Oh, no, no, no.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, the parents
both passed away.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:84%
The little girl,
at the age of 50,

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.754 align:middle line:84%
passed away only a few
months ago, we found out.

00:19:21.754 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Oh, that's sad.
-Very sad.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.570 align:middle line:90%
She had MS.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And the family
that's there now,

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:84%
do we know anything about them,
or what might be happening?

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.810 align:middle line:84%
They keep
themselves, obviously.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the the things in this
case that I would look at today

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:84%
is, were things happening
in other houses?

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And Bill Hall looked into this.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Sure enough, there were.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.837 align:middle line:84%
There was also an increase
in UFO activity at that time.

00:19:42.837 --> 00:19:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could say, well,
maybe it wasn't connected,

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:90%
maybe it wasn't.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.515 align:middle line:90%
But I tend to think it is--

00:19:46.515 --> 00:19:47.315 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Or maybe it was.

00:19:47.315 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:84%
 --because of the
sort of process

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.450 align:middle line:84%
of these multi-versal intersects
that we were talking about.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:90%
So a nasty case.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Paul, let's talk
about some other cases

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.180 align:middle line:90%
that you've looked at.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:90%
One is called The Lost Village.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was the first case
with the guy with the whip,

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and you couldn't see him.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.846 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: That was called
The Lost Village?

00:20:02.846 --> 00:20:04.660 align:middle line:84%
That was The Lost Village,
or The Village of Voices.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.960 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Explain that
a little bit more.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.871 align:middle line:84%
Because we just basically
talked six or seven witnesses

00:20:08.871 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:84%
seeing that.
PAUL: Sure.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Sure.
-What happened there?

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.293 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was
only one thing that

00:20:12.293 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
occurred in an abandoned village
in Northeast Connecticut.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was all overgrown,
of course, by this time.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.300 align:middle line:84%
The last people had moved out
of there in the late 1800s.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And there were some cellar
holes where the houses had been,

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and then a little
cemetery up the hill

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
where they were
buried, most of them.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And I later found out there that
I was related to these people.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:84%
We're an old New England
family, and we just

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.447 align:middle line:84%
crawled out of there
with the first lungfish

00:20:35.447 --> 00:20:36.780 align:middle line:84%
onto the shores of
New England, and just

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:90%
married everybody else.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So it turned out these
were relatives of mine.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were a lot of things
that happened in that case

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:84%
that I write about in my
book, "Faces at the Window."

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we walked
into this area--

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and we was a local
historian and six

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:84%
other seminary students who
didn't get in as much trouble

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:90%
as I did.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.300 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Right.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And we could hear the
sounds of daily life,

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.710 align:middle line:90%
and there was no one around.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Farm implements
banging together.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:90%
Cows mooing.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Dogs barking.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:84%
People talking as if
it was a normal day

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.510 align:middle line:90%
in the life of somebody else.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And as we proceeded into
the cellar hole area,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:90%
this just continued.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It would rise and fall a bit.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:90%
This is August.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:90%
No insects.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.989 align:middle line:84%
No birds.
Nothing.

00:21:18.989 --> 00:21:20.499 align:middle line:84%
Very strange.
-Right.

00:21:20.499 --> 00:21:22.421 align:middle line:84%
And there was a certain
feeling of depression.

00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:23.120 align:middle line:90%
You know--

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.897 align:middle line:84%
When you don't hear insects,
it's a weird, weird sound

00:21:25.897 --> 00:21:27.860 align:middle line:90%
of nothing.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: It's a sound of nothing.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, that night we went
back, and we stood on a hill

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.730 align:middle line:84%
over the Nightingale Brook,
as it's called, where

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:90%
these people had had a mill.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.191 align:middle line:84%
And we could hear
children laughing.

00:21:40.191 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of
walked down towards--

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and the odd thing about
this was that the sound was

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:84%
moving up and down
the brook, I'd

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:90%
say, at about 60 miles an hour.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.050 align:middle line:90%
No road, no houses, nothing.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And I knew, George,
some of those children

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I
knew it, and I never

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.050 align:middle line:84%
wrote about this, because
I was in enough trouble

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.150 align:middle line:90%
already in the seminary.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:84%
If they thought there
mediumistic about this,

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I would have been
fried before I was.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle line:90%
And I just buried it.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't deal with it.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:90%
And we couldn't record it.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.160 align:middle line:84%
It was like EVPs, or Electronic
Voice Phenomenon in reverse.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:90%
We could hear, but not record.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:84%
When these things
are happening to you,

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and you were still
in the seminary,

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.060 align:middle line:84%
did you begin to
question, why am I here?

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing this?

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: Not just yet.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I began to question
my initial idea

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.550 align:middle line:90%
that this might be purgatory.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.890 align:middle line:84%
These people showed no
sign of being dead at all,

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.589 align:middle line:84%
never mind being in purgatory.
GEORGE: Yeah.

00:22:29.589 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.611 align:middle line:84%
So I said, are we dealing
more with time and space?

00:22:34.611 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: A time warp?
-Than death?

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.117 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:37.117 --> 00:22:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know about
a lot of this stuff then.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people didn't
know about quantum physics.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:90%
The physicists did.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: But they never
tied it together with his.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But the popular books
hadn't been written.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:84%
They never tied it
together with this.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And a number of other
things happened,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:90%
like the ox cart driver.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
graphic on the screen

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.934 align:middle line:84%
now, if people look to the left.
-What is that?

00:22:53.934 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at there?

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the little
cemetery I mentioned.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:56.950 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: OK.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:58.116 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: And if they
look to the left,

00:22:58.116 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and sort of up in
the trees there,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.650 align:middle line:84%
there is a bright spot that
we-- and we made sure we

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:90%
had these negatives tested.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.630 align:middle line:84%
No digital photography
in those days.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:06.890 align:middle line:84%
They said this is
not a reflection.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.890 align:middle line:90%
It's an anomaly, or an extra.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.580 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't really be there.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:84%
We saw that with our
naked eye the night

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:90%
after this picture was taken.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the 1950s, I
should say, a woman

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:10%
wrote a book of local history
in which she mentioned

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:10%
that the people of this
village were afraid to go

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:10%
to the cemetery at
night because of quote,

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.410 align:middle line:10%
"ghosts seen reclining
in the branches

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.210 align:middle line:10%
of a certain elm tree."

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.960 align:middle line:90%
This was an elm tree.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.726 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That's the one.

00:23:30.726 --> 00:23:33.400 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: And here it
is, 200 years later.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:84%
So that was before
we knew enough not

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:90%
to use permanent ink on there.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: What is the story
of the poltergeist of 1974?

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, it it was '75.
GEORGE: '75?

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
That was New Haven, Connecticut,
not too far from Bridgeport.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.940 align:middle line:84%
That was the worst
poltergeist I ever dealt with.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:84%
But we got rid of it
using a joke book.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:50.980 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: A joke book?

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.891 align:middle line:84%
A joke book.
That's right.

00:23:52.891 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.304 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're trying
to make it laugh.

00:23:55.304 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:90%
This is the only picture--

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I might need some of these
jokes for some of my events

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that I'm at.
-That's right.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Or even some of your guests.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:10%
In any case, I got a call
one day from a fellow who

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.280 align:middle line:10%
I'd been in the seminary with.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:10%
He said, you're not going
to believe this one.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So down I went from Hartford
to the New Haven area.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And this was a store, one of
these the convenience stores

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:90%
with a little apartment on top.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.990 align:middle line:84%
The owners had lived
in the apartment.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And they had had
to close the store

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.500 align:middle line:84%
because all this goofy
stuff was happening.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And the woman, she
was a real warrior.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Sort of very strong personality.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.580 align:middle line:84%
She had to close
the store, and said

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:84%
that it was being repaired, so
nobody would get suspicious.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.510 align:middle line:90%
But I came to the door--

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That was her excuse.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:90%
That was her excuse.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.020 align:middle line:84%
She said, are you Paul?
I said, yes.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Grabbed me by the
sleeve and pulled me in.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.326 align:middle line:84%
And I swear I saw a bottle
of soda hanging in the air,

00:24:43.326 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
but it was all dark.
I really couldn't tell.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So up we go to the
apartment, which looked

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.560 align:middle line:90%
like it'd been hit by a bomb.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Closest I ever saw to
Hollywood's depiction

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:90%
of this sort of stuff.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.940 align:middle line:84%
There were obscenities
scrawled on the walls,

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.430 align:middle line:84%
plaster had been ripped down.
GEORGE: Horrible.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I no sooner got there
when she screamed.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I turned around, and
there was a leather

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.780 align:middle line:84%
chair the size of a Volkswagen
heading for my head.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.227 align:middle line:84%
This conversation might
not be taking place.

00:25:08.227 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:84%
The thing went right over, hit
the wall, cracked the wall.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And how long have we been
putting up with this?

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.070 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, the
better part of a year.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, poltergeist
usually don't last that long.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Not at this strength.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So to make a long
story short, there were

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.840 align:middle line:90%
about six or seven of them.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And she had taken it upon
herself to battle them

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.670 align:middle line:90%
using all the wrong weapons.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.517 align:middle line:90%
Ouija boards.

00:25:27.517 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the worst
thing you can do.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: That's the worst
thing you could have.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Throw gasoline on the
file, why don't you?

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:32.730 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah, exactly.
-Yeah, exactly.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:33.800 align:middle line:90%
She had a medium come in.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And with all due
respect to mediums,

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:84%
they don't understand the
forces or the processes

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:84%
they're dealing when they
think it's dead people.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.544 align:middle line:90%
Some girl, bitter, angry--

00:25:42.544 --> 00:25:43.810 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: They're very
naive about this.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I think so.
Yeah.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Came through and said she had
been murdered in that spot

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.290 align:middle line:90%
in the 1820s or something.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:51.594 align:middle line:84%
Now that spot had
been a cornfield.

00:25:51.594 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean somebody
couldn't have been murdered.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.060 align:middle line:84%
But it was all nonsense.
GEORGE: Right.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.034 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he's still buried there.
-Well, no.

00:25:57.034 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:84%
We didn't find anything.
GEORGE: Nothing.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So these are buttons that
parasitical entities-- this

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
is what these are,
in my opinion--

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.721 align:middle line:84%
they push in order to eat.
That's all it is.

00:26:06.721 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:84%
They're lifeforms.
They're part of nature.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: This is the way
they get their energy.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:90%
This is their MO.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So by the time I got
there, they had pretty much

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:90%
started running out of steam.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.051 align:middle line:84%
So I said, what do you
about this kind of stuff?

00:26:18.051 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you could bring in the
holy water, and the priests,

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:90%
and all this stuff.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.646 align:middle line:84%
But you know,
sometimes that works,

00:26:21.646 --> 00:26:22.800 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes it doesn't work.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:84%
What always works in
my experience is-- Ben

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and I call it the
Peter Pan theory.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Think happy thoughts.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:33.910 align:middle line:90%
John Lennon was right.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:90%
All you need is love, right?

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.430 align:middle line:84%
You come together
with your family.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.690 align:middle line:84%
She had a she had a daughter,
14-year-old daughter, who was

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.430 align:middle line:84%
kind of a tough [INAUDIBLE].
We came.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:90%
We got her back in.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle line:90%
We sat down that night.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.090 align:middle line:90%
My friend was there.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.080 align:middle line:90%
I had the joke book.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:90%
We laughed it up.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.390 align:middle line:90%
We had a great time.

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Those things were never
seen or heard from again.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:90%
What a great story.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: You know, it was great.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.804 align:middle line:84%
What drives you,
Paul, in this field?

00:26:56.804 --> 00:26:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Because you don't give up.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:90%
And your son Ben as well.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.670 align:middle line:84%
No, nobody keeps
me down for long.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:84%
What drives me
personally-- well,

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned before the show,
I'm a 62-year-old millennial.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:90%
I love new things.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out
what's going on.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, daily life,
my wife will tell you,

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm not too good at daily life.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.220 align:middle line:84%
But as far as finding out
what is really behind things--

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:90%
You're good at that.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.580 align:middle line:90%
I like to find that out.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why our show is called
"Behind the Paranormal."

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And our motto is "Everything
you know is wrong.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Start again."

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:27.820 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
hobbyists out there

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.630 align:middle line:84%
who treat ghost hunting, a
term like this, [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
party night, right?

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's that, and
it's like bird watching

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:90%
or butterfly collecting.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:90%
You can't approach it that way.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:90%
It's too dangerous.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was '06, I
found myself against my better

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:84%
judgment addressing
a group of neophyte

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.180 align:middle line:84%
ghost hunters in
Florida, a conference

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:90%
for beginning ghost hunters.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said,
oh Paul, if you

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:84%
had one word of advice to give
to the group, what would it be?

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.820 align:middle line:90%
I said, don't.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:90%
And 230 people started at me.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, however,
here we all,

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to
have to deal with.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we went on
to talk about it.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's not something
people should be doing

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.010 align:middle line:90%
as if they're playing soccer.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:90%
They're dealing with things--

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: -or a party.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Or a party.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea what
they're dealing with,

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.330 align:middle line:84%
what they're touching,
what this involves.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:84%
What this can bring
into their lives.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And I really cringe
when they start

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.220 align:middle line:84%
to counsel people who are in
homes that are having problems.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I had a show on Coast to
Coast several years ago

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that I was building up
as my Ouija board show.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.450 align:middle line:90%
And I backed out.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, was it smart to back out?

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Or was I just being foolish?

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.820 align:middle line:90%
You were smart to back out.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:84%
The Ouija board,
George, to me, is

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:84%
equivalent to moving
into a new house,

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.770 align:middle line:84%
wanting to meet your
next door neighbor,

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and taking a bulldozer and
knocking down their front wall

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.470 align:middle line:90%
in order to do the meeting.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's not going
to be a good thing.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.173 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
make any friends.

00:28:52.173 --> 00:28:54.420 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what's going
to come out of that wall.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not a game.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.730 align:middle line:90%
A bunch of Dobermans, like.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who knows?

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not a game.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And people say-- I had a cousin
in Florida who was almost 100

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.430 align:middle line:90%
before she left us.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And she used the
Ouija board every day

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.210 align:middle line:90%
to talk to her friends.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And nothing ever seemed
to happen to her.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.760 align:middle line:84%
But I told her, it's like,
you can stand in the middle

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.020 align:middle line:90%
of the interstate highway.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'll get hit.
Maybe you won't.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:16.530 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Maybe not.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's not worth
taking the risk.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad I didn't.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:20.730 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:24.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a sledgehammer way of
cutting through boundaries

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.600 align:middle line:90%
in space-time.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
spirits necessarily

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.750 align:middle line:90%
come in and do things.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.300 align:middle line:84%
It's that you're just
opening so many doors

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that these parasitical entities
that we always talk about

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.300 align:middle line:84%
can come through and
start feeding on you.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.800 align:middle line:84%
If it works, if it is indeed
a porthole to whatever's

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.330 align:middle line:90%
out there, what is happening?

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing that's
happening on our end

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.360 align:middle line:84%
is that people believing what
they're being told by whatever

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.970 align:middle line:90%
is doing the telling.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.131 align:middle line:84%
It'll say, well, I'm so and
so from the Middle Ages.

00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:54.830 align:middle line:90%
And you know--

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.541 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: And how do
you know, right?

00:29:56.541 --> 00:29:59.395 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
And they just buy it.

00:29:59.395 --> 00:30:00.995 align:middle line:84%
And then all these weird
things start to happen.

00:30:00.995 --> 00:30:02.910 align:middle line:84%
I think what's happening
is that in many cases,

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:06.410 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with parasitical
entities who live simply--

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.390 align:middle line:90%
and they're not spirits.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:90%
They're not demons.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.730 align:middle line:84%
They're not servants of Satan.
They're living.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:11.700 align:middle line:90%
They're lifeforms.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.220 align:middle line:84%
There are about nine
different species.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Disembodied people
who had died?

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm open to that
possibility, but I

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.320 align:middle line:84%
don't think there's
any such-- I don't

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
want to say there's any such
thing as disembodied people.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
this multiverse idea,

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.600 align:middle line:84%
where we're living in many, many
universities at the same time,

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:90%
how can you die?

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.530 align:middle line:90%
How can even the body die?

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:90%
I think of it as a tree.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.880 align:middle line:90%
A leaf falls off a tree.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're the
tree, not the leaf.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:38.989 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That's right.

00:30:38.989 --> 00:30:40.560 align:middle line:84%
You have billions and
billions of other lives.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.540 align:middle line:90%
And also, what's one leaf?

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.710 align:middle line:90%
They go back.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.250 align:middle line:84%
So the Ouija board, I
don't think it's humans.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be something that
is human in another universe,

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.640 align:middle line:84%
but has lost so much humanity
we don't recognize it.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.440 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing, George.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.330 align:middle line:84%
This unity of life throughout
the different worlds

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:01.930 align:middle line:90%
isn't just us.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.120 align:middle line:84%
It really extends to
the whole biosphere.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So I run into cases
where people bond,

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I think, with the
parasite, which

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.760 align:middle line:84%
can lead to what we in
folklore call possession,

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.220 align:middle line:90%
which is a real phenomenon.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.030 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the parasite knows
what it is that person

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.120 align:middle line:90%
in a part of the multiverse.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.970 align:middle line:84%
They're very aware of
these sorts of realities.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:32.501 align:middle line:84%
So this parasite really
could be a part of you.

00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:33.200 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It could be.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.266 align:middle line:90%
That's a really scary kind of--

00:31:34.266 --> 00:31:37.500 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: I've thought about that.
I hope not.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.270 align:middle line:90%
I hope not too.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.236 align:middle line:90%
But I've thought about that.

00:31:39.236 --> 00:31:41.200 align:middle line:84%
But when you see
these possession cases,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.300 align:middle line:90%
there's an identity here.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And it really scared me
when I first encountered.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And boy, I mean, so that's
something to be aware of.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.370 align:middle line:84%
There is an incredible,
incredible response

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:84%
about investigating
the other side now.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.010 align:middle line:84%
We hear stories from
children about strange things

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:01.570 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.970 align:middle line:84%
You're a paranormal
investigator.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Is science catching up with
what you do to the point

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:84%
where one day, it will simply
say, of course, it exists?

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, the science
still has-- science,

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, mainstream
physical science

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.340 align:middle line:84%
still has trouble
with psychology,

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.480 align:middle line:90%
because it's not exact.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.210 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
science, George,

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and the scientific
method in particular

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.810 align:middle line:84%
is that it's based on
a materialistic view

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.760 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty much blown
out of the water by quantum

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.750 align:middle line:84%
mechanics, and even philosophy,
and everything else,

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.680 align:middle line:84%
because the world doesn't
seem to be-- not only

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.590 align:middle line:84%
doesn't seem to be one
world, it doesn't seem

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:42.570 align:middle line:90%
to be entirely physical world.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:44.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's a problem.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:47.220 align:middle line:84%
You can't duplicate
things, replicate things,

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.750 align:middle line:84%
that are done in the paranormal,
not even in the laboratory

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.300 align:middle line:90%
when they accomplish anything.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And mainstream science
won't accept that.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it's mainstream
science that has to change,

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.310 align:middle line:90%
not paranormal investigation.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:58.400 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: I think you're right.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of these
cases that you've looked at

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.550 align:middle line:90%
or know.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.660 align:middle line:90%
What is the Haunter.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Haunter was 1979,
and it knocked me sideways.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Just unexpected.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I was just out of
graduate school

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and had nothing, and was
living by a little cottage

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.891 align:middle line:84%
by a lake in Connecticut.
GEORGE: Peaceful.

00:33:16.891 --> 00:33:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Peaceful.
Very peaceful.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, I was writing

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.121 align:middle line:84%
plays for the Connecticut
Dance Theatre, of all things.

00:33:22.121 --> 00:33:22.820 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Huh.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, a call
came in from a young girl

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.700 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Connecticut.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was becoming
known in the field.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, locally, anyway.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And she said, something
happened to me over the weekend.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget it
as long as I live.

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.850 align:middle line:90%
And we just can't deal with it.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.450 align:middle line:84%
She had been in Maine
with her sister, who

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:84%
was well known as someone
interested in the occult

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.970 align:middle line:90%
and the paranormal.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And they'd been
with some friends.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And they were driving
by a house in what

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.860 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be the town
of York, in the York Harbor,

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.770 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And the young girl,
the young sister,

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.086 align:middle line:84%
suddenly said, stop the
car, that's my house.

00:33:56.086 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So before they could
stop her, she leaped out

00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:59.490 align:middle line:84%
of the car, which
was a convertible,

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and up they ran to the
porch of this house,

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.250 align:middle line:90%
knocked on the door.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:08.420 align:middle line:84%
The door was answered
by a woman, who screamed

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.739 align:middle line:90%
when she saw this young girl.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:10.940 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: No.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.920 align:middle line:90%
A man came to the door.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.760 align:middle line:84%
This was a childless
couple in their 40's.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't speak when
they saw this girl.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had the willies
by this time, so--

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Trying to figure out why.
What's going on here?

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:22.503 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: Trying to figure
out, what's going on here?

00:34:22.503 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:84%
And finally the man said--
well, the young girl said,

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:27.710 align:middle line:90%
I feel as if I know this house.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry for bothering you.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.409 align:middle line:90%
How old was the kid?

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:32.080 align:middle line:90%
The kid was 17.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.219 align:middle line:84%
And the man said, you
should know this house.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:37.280 align:middle line:90%
You haunt it.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.250 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody,
OK, see you later.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.739 align:middle line:84%
They kind of like, they
backed off the steps.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:46.570 align:middle line:90%
They backed down to the car.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So I said I, have to
find out about this.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:49.389 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Yeah.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:51.139 align:middle line:84%
They happened to get
a name on the mailbox.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:52.130 align:middle line:90%
As luck would have it--

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.750 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: But the 17-year-old
was a real human being, right?

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Oh, sure.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:58.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the story.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I managed to get in
touch with these people,

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.410 align:middle line:84%
because my mother's family had
had a house, a summer house,

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:90%
in that town for over 100 years.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.760 align:middle line:90%
So we had connections.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:90%
So we found out who they were.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:10.180 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, the young
girl, through the Institute

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.870 align:middle line:84%
of Living in Hartford,
Connecticut for the Minnesota

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Multiphasic of
Personality Inventory--

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.200 align:middle line:90%
spell it if you want, MMPI.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not a diagnostic tool.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:21.500 align:middle line:84%
It just says if you need some
more treatment, if there's

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.350 align:middle line:84%
something else beyond the normal
neuroses, and all that stuff.

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:26.500 align:middle line:90%
So she was fine.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:84%
It turned out she was
kind of glossed over.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Probably a couple of-- you
know, like most people.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.990 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that was
unusual about her was she

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.087 align:middle line:84%
had had dreams of
being in that house.

00:35:36.087 --> 00:35:37.420 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Yeah, about
being in that house.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.600 align:middle line:84%
 --doing all the
things that people later

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.220 align:middle line:84%
told me they saw her doing--
-At that time.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.510 align:middle line:90%
 --thinking she was a ghost.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.650 align:middle line:90%
Not at that time.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:47.370 align:middle line:84%
At different times, which
I found was rather odd.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.120 align:middle line:84%
They saw her sitting
in a certain chair,

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.700 align:middle line:84%
looking out the front
window, in transparent form,

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.120 align:middle line:90%
coming down the stairs.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Was she dreaming that,
though, at that time?

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:59.790 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: No, not at that time, but
she was right dreaming that.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:middle line:84%
OK.
She was having these dreams.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.470 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: She knew that house.
-OK.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And the really odd thing was
that she was, in the dreams,

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:09.400 align:middle line:84%
a mother living in this house,
and she had a couple of kids.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, her
dreams were manifesting

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.187 align:middle line:90%
themselves in that house.

00:36:14.187 --> 00:36:15.420 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: In that house,
to those people.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And they were seeing
what she was streaming?

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And they thought naturally
that she was a ghost.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.350 align:middle line:90%
What else could it be?

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:23.700 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: I would
think the same thing.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.200 align:middle line:84%
People don't look at
these other possibilities.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So I think we may have
had a rare occasion

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:84%
of the same parallel
worlds being

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:33.300 align:middle line:90%
experienced by similar people.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they
met on that porch,

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.520 align:middle line:84%
all phenomena
ceased immediately.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Never happened again.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.040 align:middle line:84%
A physicist might
say that the wave

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.810 align:middle line:84%
function had been collapsed,
and the worlds had joined.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Become one.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.531 align:middle line:84%
So these people were really
fried out of their minds

00:36:47.531 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:84%
about this.
GEORGE: Great story.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:49.870 align:middle line:84%
They were so
scared, they wouldn't

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.390 align:middle line:84%
go-- they wouldn't walk around
their own house by themselves.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.601 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: That was
an amazing story.

00:36:53.601 --> 00:36:55.011 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Nice girl?

00:36:55.011 --> 00:36:56.790 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: Yeah.
Nice kids.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Normal people.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Pushed me over the edge
into a whole new idea

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:00.690 align:middle line:90%
about what this is about.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:02.205 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: What do you
think that was all about?

00:37:02.205 --> 00:37:06.950 align:middle line:84%
The control of dreams
manifesting themselves whenever

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:08.710 align:middle line:90%
you-- thought patterns.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I say, it really
threw me for a loop.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.820 align:middle line:90%
I was very confused.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, obviously, this
isn't a dead person.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So a few years later, though,
I encountered Chopra's book.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.300 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:84%
A book about quantum
physics anyway.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It was a popular exposure
sort of quantum physics,

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and an extrapolation
on what might

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.960 align:middle line:84%
be possible with multiple
worlds and things of this kind.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So I said, wow,
this is what I've

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.740 align:middle line:84%
been seeing all these
years, and this answers

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.330 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the questions.
-Fascinating.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, I've
sort of built on that.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's grown and grown
and grown and grown

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.800 align:middle line:90%
into a whole new interpretation.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're wrong, but
it certainly seems to be

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.310 align:middle line:90%
working out after 40 years.

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.130 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.270 align:middle line:84%
What about Bridgewater Triangle?
What's that?

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Bridgewater
Triangle is

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.200 align:middle line:90%
an example of where this went.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.530 align:middle line:84%
We stopped looking
at just one case

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:84%
with just one
house, or one ghost,

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:02.677 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it.

00:38:02.677 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And we started
looking, gee, I wonder

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.760 align:middle line:84%
if the neighbors are
having-- sure enough, we

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.100 align:middle line:90%
started to uncover flap areas.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.860 align:middle line:84%
In other words, areas
where large numbers

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.980 align:middle line:84%
of paranormal
phenomena are occurring

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that don't necessarily
seem to be related,

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.090 align:middle line:84%
but that may be related
because the same intercepts

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:19.210 align:middle line:90%
are making them possible.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Intersects of these
parallel worlds.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So the Bridgewater Triangle
is not far from where

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.730 align:middle line:90%
we live in New England.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's a 220-square mile
wilderness area that's

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.860 align:middle line:90%
practically inside of Boston.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.323 align:middle line:84%
And people are
surprised to hear that,

00:38:31.323 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:90%
because that's a big city.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.280 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly swamp area.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:84%
But since Native American
times, weird stories

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:40.380 align:middle line:84%
have been heard about
this place-- giant

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.010 align:middle line:84%
birds, strange
lights, giant snakes,

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.990 align:middle line:90%
cryptids, ghosts, poltergeists.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.890 align:middle line:90%
You name it, it's in there.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:46.510 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: A lot of
activity up there.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.420 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: A lot of activity.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.680 align:middle line:84%
At one point in the
'70s, a police officer

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.890 align:middle line:90%
was sitting there.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.516 align:middle line:84%
He claims a Bigfoot lifted
up the back of his car

00:38:53.516 --> 00:38:54.515 align:middle line:90%
and dropped it with him in it.

00:38:54.515 --> 00:38:55.490 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Whoa.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't hurt, but
he was pretty shaken up.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a hill called Bird
Hill, where supposedly

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.850 align:middle line:90%
giant birds are seen.

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:05.550 align:middle line:84%
When you're investigating
areas like this, George,

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.180 align:middle line:84%
you always talk to hunters
because they're out there.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.164 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: They know.
They know.

00:39:09.164 --> 00:39:10.630 align:middle line:84%
They know, and they
see some of this stuff.

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:11.563 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: They see this stuff.

00:39:11.563 --> 00:39:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
strange normal things,

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.180 align:middle line:84%
like coy dogs, I
guess you call them,

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:84%
coyotes, which have come back
to New England with a vengeance.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Coyotes and dogs interbreeding.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Stuff like that.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot of things
that they just can't explain.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Our particular experience
there has been rather odd.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.950 align:middle line:84%
We were at the head
of the lake one

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:middle line:84%
time, the beautiful lake
between Fall River, Mass,

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.960 align:middle line:90%
and the Freetown State Forest.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And we felt like-- I say
we, Ben and myself-- felt

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.420 align:middle line:90%
like we were being watched.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.390 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] snap a few pictures.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.110 align:middle line:84%
You have some of
the graphics here.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we looked
at the pictures,

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
there were little figures
in these pictures.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.140 align:middle line:84%
At least it looked like--
it's very perilous--

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.360 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Like little leprechauns?

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: Well, I don't know.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.390 align:middle line:84%
They looked like
normal human beings.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:56.630 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: But little tiny ones?

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Little tiny ones.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And this area-- and again,
you have to be careful.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Pictures taken in the woods with
sunlight, all kinds of things

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:03.740 align:middle line:90%
can happen.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But flesh tones in nature
are very rare, unless you're

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.490 align:middle line:90%
dealing with certain fungi.

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:08.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's what made us look.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.611 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle seems
to be a full figure.

00:40:10.611 --> 00:40:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Almost--

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.200 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: A little
person on a leaf.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:13.970 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: Yeah.

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like standing on a leaf.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.630 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I have run into the fairy
thing before in Puerto Rico.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.970 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Right.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But I never got any
photographs of them,

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.890 align:middle line:90%
if that's what this is.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.110 align:middle line:84%
The area has little people
known as Pukwudgies.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.831 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Putwudgies.
-Pukwudgies.

00:40:29.831 --> 00:40:32.090 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Pukwudgies.
-P-U-K. Pukwudgies.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.171 align:middle line:84%
And if you look, there's sort
of almost like a monkish face

00:40:35.171 --> 00:40:35.870 align:middle line:90%
with a hood.

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's the flesh tones
that really gave it away.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, maybe it's nothing.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.220 align:middle line:90%
But it really stuck out for us.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Pukwudgies are supposed
to be little people who are not

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:49.234 align:middle line:84%
nice, and will sometimes
lead you into a bog,

00:40:49.234 --> 00:40:50.000 align:middle line:90%
or something like this.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.866 align:middle line:90%
Now, I spoke to a fellow--

00:40:50.866 --> 00:40:52.240 align:middle line:90%
To do what?

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.435 align:middle line:90%
Maybe to drown.

00:40:53.435 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
happened supposedly.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans will
tell you that's happened.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.400 align:middle line:84%
We talked to a fellow who was
walking his dog in this area,

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and he swears it was at night,
a little figure stepped out

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:06.000 align:middle line:84%
from the bushes, kind
of gestured him forward,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.221 align:middle line:84%
looked very friendly, but
the dog naturally, you know,

00:41:09.221 --> 00:41:09.920 align:middle line:90%
had fit.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And so he thought that retreat
was the better part of valor,

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:13.840 align:middle line:90%
and off they went.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So he says, he's seen the other
people say they've seen him.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:20.070 align:middle line:84%
The natives, the Wampanoags,
have a meeting place there.

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:21.650 align:middle line:90%
A nice building.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:23.350 align:middle line:84%
But they only go
there once a year.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.620 align:middle line:90%
They don't really like it.

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.070 align:middle line:84%
It's part of their
traditional lands.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.140 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Huh.
Is it scary?

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:27.839 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:30.320 align:middle line:84%
There are ghost stories,
a ghostly truck.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.440 align:middle line:90%
You name it, it goes on there.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So we're investigating
that right now

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.060 align:middle line:84%
as an area where you've
got not necessarily

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.190 align:middle line:90%
separate things going on.

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.970 align:middle line:90%
How small are they?

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Two to three feet sometimes.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.720 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes smaller.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.940 align:middle line:84%
But areas where you've got
these intersects going on

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.900 align:middle line:84%
between parallel worlds
where these things may live,

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:49.560 align:middle line:90%
cross over, interact.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, might be
the root of the paranormal.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And here it is on
a massive scale.

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:54.810 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason
why we can't have

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:56.550 align:middle line:90%
little people on this planet.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:57.570 align:middle line:90%
No, absolutely not.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:59.747 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: There's no reason.

00:41:59.747 --> 00:42:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, you want to hear
about the Puerto Rico thing?

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Because that was pretty strange.
GEORGE: Yeah.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.856 align:middle line:84%
What is that?
Do you have a title for that?

00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:05.555 align:middle line:90%
Uh,

00:42:05.555 --> 00:42:06.955 align:middle line:84%
Well, I suppose, yeah,
you can call them,

00:42:06.955 --> 00:42:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, the
fairies of San Juan.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.440 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: The fairies of San Juan.
-Yeah.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.550 align:middle line:90%
Like a children's movie.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:14.090 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, I was
there in the line of duty

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:15.020 align:middle line:90%
in the US Coast Guard.

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.460 align:middle line:90%
And wherever I would go--

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for serving, by the way.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're very welcome.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.710 align:middle line:84%
It was really interesting,
especially when

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.080 align:middle line:90%
I got involved in this stuff.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.600 align:middle line:84%
But with the permission
of my superiors,

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I took some of the
equipment from the ship,

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.100 align:middle line:84%
because one of the
crew members had

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.530 align:middle line:84%
knew somebody who was a--
and these were not bumpkins.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:33.290 align:middle line:84%
The fellow was a real
estate-- not a tycoon,

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:35.210 align:middle line:90%
but a real estate professional.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.130 align:middle line:90%
And the wife was a doctor.

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
fairies would clean

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:41.150 align:middle line:90%
their house every Saturday.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.290 align:middle line:90%
They would go for a walk.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:43.060 align:middle line:84%
The fairies would
clean their house.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Fairies would
clean their house.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.840 align:middle line:84%
-That's nice of them.
-Yeah.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.251 align:middle line:84%
Where do you hire these people?
-Yeah.

00:42:48.251 --> 00:42:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Cheap labor.
-Yeah, exactly.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:50.990 align:middle line:90%
They come back.

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And the breakfast
dishes would be done.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Everything would be done.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:54.500 align:middle line:90%
Just take a walk.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And they'd leave
beer and fruit--

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:58.560 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Out?
-Out.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.790 align:middle line:90%
And it would be gone.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.344 align:middle line:90%
Not the dietary combination--

00:43:01.344 --> 00:43:02.210 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: You mean for them?

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:03.050 align:middle line:90%
For the fairies.

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
So I came in.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I
have to see this.

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So I set up cameras
and everything else.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And I went for the walk with
them that Saturday morning.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.680 align:middle line:84%
We came back, and
nothing was done.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And I almost had to
do the housework.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Because they said, oh, they
were scared by the cameras.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they decided they weren't
gonna clean this time, huh?

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just, you know, well,
maybe they're making this stuff

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.124 align:middle line:84%
up, but these are not
the kind of people

00:43:21.124 --> 00:43:22.090 align:middle line:90%
who would make this stuff up.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:24.430 align:middle line:84%
They had children, and the
children swore to this.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So I never took
pictures of the fairies.

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:29.210 align:middle line:90%
I prevented them from appearing.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But they apparently
knew whatever--

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Ben often points
out the word fairy

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.040 align:middle line:90%
sort of implies disbelief.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.393 align:middle line:84%
And if you use
other words for it,

00:43:40.393 --> 00:43:42.740 align:middle line:84%
perhaps it would be more
credible, but fairies,

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:43.700 align:middle line:90%
people understand that.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.948 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about Room 305.

00:43:45.948 --> 00:43:46.860 align:middle line:90%
PAUL: Room 305.

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.400 align:middle line:90%
I like that name, Room 305.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Really dark kind
of case in a way.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Massachusetts School
District, big old school

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.330 align:middle line:90%
built in the 1920s.

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was really funny, because
the superintendent of schools

00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:59.370 align:middle line:90%
called me on the phone.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And it took him awhile
to get to the point.

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:05.474 align:middle line:84%
He said, are you Paul,
the ghost expert?

00:44:05.474 --> 00:44:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I don't know
how to tell you this,

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and I said, just
get to the point.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:08.991 align:middle line:84%
Right?
GEORGE: Yeah.

00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:11.810 align:middle line:84%
The school was having
all kinds of problems.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:14.240 align:middle line:84%
The janitors didn't want
to go into this Room 305.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Teachers didn't
want to teach there.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Kids were unruly there.

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:18.050 align:middle line:90%
It was a classroom?

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.540 align:middle line:90%
It was the classroom.

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Furniture would be
rearranged in the morning.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.840 align:middle line:84%
There would be
strange things written

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.260 align:middle line:84%
on the chalkboard
nobody could read.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.470 align:middle line:84%
There would even be
chalk dust in the air,

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.170 align:middle line:90%
and nobody had been in there.

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So everybody was
getting spooked out.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with this
was that it was a school.

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, any kind of
rumor of any kind of ghost

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:38.800 align:middle line:84%
in a school is going
to get embellished

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.737 align:middle line:84%
and carried on for generations,
and it's going to create

00:44:40.737 --> 00:44:41.770 align:middle line:90%
chaos in the halls of learning.

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:43.970 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: And it gets bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.470 align:middle line:90%
So they decided to call me in.

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:47.890 align:middle line:84%
I had to meet with
the school committee,

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:49.600 align:middle line:90%
equivalent of the school board.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And they swore me to secrecy
that you cannot bring a camera,

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:56.230 align:middle line:84%
you cannot write about this
for five years, and you cannot

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:58.220 align:middle line:90%
name-- I had to sign a paper.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.420 align:middle line:84%
You cannot name the
school district, and you

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.185 align:middle line:90%
cannot talk about this--

00:45:02.185 --> 00:45:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Any place.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Media.

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Not even my show?

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, I didn't realize
I was going to be on your show,

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:08.730 align:middle line:84%
so they're just going
to have to live with it.

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.940 align:middle line:90%
But again, this is way back.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.590 align:middle line:90%
1993, as a matter of fact.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So I went in, and I
didn't have a camera.

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you're just going
to have to take me in there.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.610 align:middle line:84%
The principal,
meanwhile, was kind

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:24.100 align:middle line:84%
of hovering annoyingly around as
I was getting ready to do this.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But then he kind
of got into this.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So he took me up to Room 305.
School day was over.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:30.210 align:middle line:90%
It was early June.

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.030 align:middle line:84%
School day was over, and
we're sitting in there.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:33.720 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't take long.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.350 align:middle line:84%
We started to hear furniture
being dragged around.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:38.140 align:middle line:84%
We started to hear
someone-- we felt

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.060 align:middle line:90%
as though someone was writhing.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.264 align:middle line:84%
Someone was pacing up and down
in front of the blackboard.

00:45:42.264 --> 00:45:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And then in front
of the window, it

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:47.090 align:middle line:84%
was on the left side of the
room, I heard a kind of a rush.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:48.481 align:middle line:84%
He was out of there.
-Gone.

00:45:48.481 --> 00:45:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Gone.
You know.

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Later, I saw him looking,
and it scared me.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was something--
it was him looking in the glass

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:54.730 align:middle line:90%
window of the door.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So to make a long story
short, what happened,

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I did some research
on this, there

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:01.500 align:middle line:84%
was a teacher in
this room who was

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:07.190 align:middle line:84%
killed in the 1930s in a trolley
car accident in this area.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And the people said, aha, it's
got to be her ghost coming back

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:10.910 align:middle line:90%
to the room.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Her spirit and all.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.070 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] not so fast.

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, I think what you
may be dealing with here

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:20.230 align:middle line:90%
is a problem with time.

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:23.231 align:middle line:84%
She goes, well-- and I actually
contacted a student of hers

00:46:23.231 --> 00:46:26.440 align:middle line:84%
from [INAUDIBLE].
He was in his 80's by that time.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.820 align:middle line:84%
He said she would always
around in front of that board,

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.510 align:middle line:84%
up and down in front
of the windows,

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and she would do all this
stuff that was being done

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.330 align:middle line:90%
in front of these witnesses.

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:43.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that her death
had a lot less to do

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.370 align:middle line:90%
with this than her life did.

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Because she was a very, very
nervous and frustrated person.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.900 align:middle line:84%
The children wouldn't dare
step out of line with her,

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.940 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't really like her.

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And all the kinds of emotions
that might punch a hole

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:59.770 align:middle line:84%
in space-time and allow you to
manifest in a parallel world,

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:03.850 align:middle line:84%
where it's to us the future,
or it's still the 1930s ,

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:07.130 align:middle line:84%
before you got pancaked
by a trolley car,

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:08.470 align:middle line:90%
I think that's what it's about.

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:12.380 align:middle line:84%
It was really her in
the 1930s, walking

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:13.940 align:middle line:90%
up and down that blackboard.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:18.140 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they stop?

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.580 align:middle line:90%
What are they there for?

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they just leave?

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.040 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to leave.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.240 align:middle line:90%
See, here's the thing--

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.960 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Do they need this?

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that has
anything to do with it.

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't if she knows she's
anywhere but in the 1930s.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Are they aware of the classroom
when they're doing their thing?

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they are.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But I think they see
them as we see us.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.050 align:middle line:84%
One example is when-- a common
thing is when you have a baby

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.900 align:middle line:84%
sometimes in an area
where there's a problem,

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and people will walk in,
and much to their terror,

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.870 align:middle line:84%
see a figure bending
over looking at the baby.

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But then you find out, well,
somebody lived in that house,

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.500 align:middle line:84%
or later lives in that
house, because this could

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.620 align:middle line:84%
be a manifestation of what
to us is the future as well

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:84%
as the past, then you
may have someone who's

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:01.370 align:middle line:90%
looking at their own baby.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of interesting--

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.620 align:middle line:90%
they see us as we see them.

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I've had many cases where
" ghosts," quote, unquote,

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:08.670 align:middle line:84%
have thought we
were ghosts haunting

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.910 align:middle line:90%
them and were afraid of us.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:13.560 align:middle line:84%
In one Connecticut case, I had
to go downstairs and convince

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:17.130 align:middle line:84%
the great grandparents,
who had died years ago,

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.130 align:middle line:84%
that their great
granddaughter was not a ghost,

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:20.370 align:middle line:90%
because they were afraid of her.

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:22.140 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: They thought
they were the ghosts.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:22.925 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: So they're in
parallel worlds where--

00:48:22.925 --> 00:48:24.104 align:middle line:84%
-I've seen that.
-Yeah.

00:48:24.104 --> 00:48:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, that's-- I
don't think we're dealing

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:26.760 align:middle line:90%
with spirits here.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.680 align:middle line:84%
What has been for you
the most fulfilling aspect

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.120 align:middle line:90%
of what you're doing, Paul?

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.540 align:middle line:90%
What is it about this?

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I think if you approach it
this way, it gives people hope.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.377 align:middle line:84%
And people need hope
today, because there

00:48:39.377 --> 00:48:40.210 align:middle line:90%
isn't a lot of it around.

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.260 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: They need lots of hope.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.720 align:middle line:90%
They need lots of hope.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of, getting
back to that question,

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:47.780 align:middle line:84%
am I going to be
OK, answered maybe

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.360 align:middle line:84%
in an entirely new way,
that's a lot easier

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.040 align:middle line:90%
to maybe grasp and understand.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.010 align:middle line:84%
It can be illustrated perhaps
going beyond the question

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:57.790 align:middle line:90%
about my father to my mother.

00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:59.480 align:middle line:84%
On our show, people
will often ask, well,

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.080 align:middle line:90%
I lost my father and my mother.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.400 align:middle line:90%
How do I deal with it?

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Are they still here
and all this stuff?

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.700 align:middle line:84%
So my mother passed away
in 2011 at the age of 95.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.280 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That's when my dad died.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.540 align:middle line:90%
2011 at the age of 88.

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.069 align:middle line:84%
PAUL: Wow.
OK.

00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:15.010 align:middle line:84%
-December 3.
-All right.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So people wrote in, and in
so many words, they said,

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, wise guy, how do
you deal with loss?

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.600 align:middle line:10%
You're always telling
us how to deal with it.

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.580 align:middle line:10%
I said, you know, I have
a better relationship

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.900 align:middle line:10%
with my mother now
than I ever had,

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.380 align:middle line:10%
because it's not
that she's with me,

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.690 align:middle line:10%
but I'm with her in so
many parallel worlds--

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:32.790 align:middle line:10%
GEORGE: Yes, I
feel the same way.

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:34.150 align:middle line:90%
 --where she never died.

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's all
in our subconscious.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I think our entire
subconscious is

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:40.640 align:middle line:84%
made up of lives
we're living, just

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.170 align:middle line:90%
as conscious as they are here.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:44.955 align:middle line:84%
And this life we're living
here is subconscious there.

00:49:44.955 --> 00:49:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a very
elegant kind of harmony.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.500 align:middle line:90%
I think so too.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Paul, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And if people want to monitor
you, what's your website?

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Behindtheparanormal.com.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.320 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Simple as that?
-Simple as that.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.911 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Give your
son Ben my regards.

00:49:58.911 --> 00:49:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Would you?
-I will.

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Paul.

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.249 align:middle line:84%
-Thank you, George.
-OK.

00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So I know you've been
peeking at your television

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:05.570 align:middle line:90%
watching this program.

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.980 align:middle line:10%
You can take the
covers back down.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.470 align:middle line:10%
Everything's OK.

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:13.980 align:middle line:10%
And I'll see you on another
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:19.900 align:middle line:90%
