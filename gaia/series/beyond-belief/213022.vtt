00:00:17.588 --> 00:00:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.450 align:middle line:10%
Sheila Gillette back with
us, a bestselling author

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.140 align:middle line:10%
and the channeler for 12
archangels known collectively

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:10%
as Theo.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Her work has been verified by
physicists and researchers,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and has supported
millions of people

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.480 align:middle line:84%
around the planet in
their spiritual journeys.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Sheila, welcome
back to the program.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
Thank you, George.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.260 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be with you again.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a
near-death experience.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I did.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.047 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about that.

00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: In 1969 after
the birth of a child,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:10%
I had pulmonary embolus.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:10%
And I was in intensive care.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
My lungs were
non-functional and I

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.715 align:middle line:84%
felt like I had an elephant
sitting on my chest.

00:00:56.715 --> 00:00:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It hurt that much.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Well, it was more--

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pressure.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I couldn't breathe.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:10%
I only had a little tiny place
in the top of my right lung

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.280 align:middle line:10%
that I could even breathe.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And my family was
being prepared that I

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.685 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't live through the day.

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:14.485 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And I was in
intensive care and I knew,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I knew if I closed my eyes,
I wouldn't open them again.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.035 align:middle line:90%
But I knew I could live.

00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:25.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared?

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I wasn't scared,
that's the interesting thing.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't scared.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I had two little
kids at home and I had

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.143 align:middle line:84%
a brand-new baby, and I just
wanted to stay on the planet--

00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:37.185 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They needed you.

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --to
be their mother.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I just kept saying,
hey God, give me a job.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:90%
I'll do anything.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:90%
And that became like a mantra.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was not
sedated in any way.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And because of the blood
clotting, I was wide awake

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.540 align:middle line:90%
and I knew what was going on.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And the cubicle,
the intensive care

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:84%
became extremely
bright, as if the sun

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.690 align:middle line:90%
had risen in the room itself.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And I blinked and I saw a
movement at the end of my bed.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And as I focused on it,
Jesus was standing there.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.215 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my.

00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:16.677 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
that's what I thought.

00:02:16.677 --> 00:02:18.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got
the heavy hitters.

00:02:18.135 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's
what I thought.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought to myself,
wow, his eyes are so beautiful.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:90%
I was mesmerized by his eyes.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And about the time
I thought that, he

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:90%
crossed his arms like this.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And when he did so, I heard
in my inner mind hearing

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:90%
like we hear our own thoughts.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.870 align:middle line:84%
But I heard a distinct male
voice say, remember, my child,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:90%
you are loved.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:90%
And then he smiled at me.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.415 align:middle line:90%
And I felt my whole body relax.

00:02:49.415 --> 00:02:51.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he
going to take you?

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I don't know, to
tell you the truth George.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:84%
When he smiled, my
body relaxed and I

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:84%
felt like the crown of
my head had opened up

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and a warm liquid
had been poured in.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
about the pressure?

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, this
warmth just went down

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:90%
through my whole body.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And as it got to my-- the
trunk of my body, my chest,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I felt as if I could
take a deep breath.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For the first
time in hours, right?

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.427 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Days, really.

00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And it was like
I could take a deep breath.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, it was a
near death experience,

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
I had many of the
similar things we all

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
have read about or heard
about, but more importantly, I

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:90%
believe I was healed.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.125 align:middle line:84%
I believe that Jesus healed
me in that intensive care.

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Through
this experience,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.842 align:middle line:84%
did you then become a
channeler after that?

00:03:46.842 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Right after that.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:84%
About six months after I
got out of the hospital

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and I could hold
the energy, I had

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of phenomena happening
to me, externally, internally.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I could hear clairaudiently that
inner mind hearing messages as I

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:90%
heard Jesus's voice that day.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I tranced
spontaneously and became

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.610 align:middle line:84%
what was called at the time
a direct voice trance medium.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Channeling was not even a phrase
used at the time I opened up.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And then messages
started coming through me

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
in that form of a direct
voice speaking through me.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you think
this near-death experience

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:90%
was the catalyst for this?

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I have no doubt.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt because it was
such a phenomenal experience.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, now, today I've
been doing it over 50 years

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
so it's comfortable for me to
allow Theo to come in and speak.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning
it was not frightening

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:90%
because I had asked for a job.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So in my inner feeling was
all this phenomena that

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
was happening to me was
a part of this opening

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:90%
whatever job I was doing.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wanted
this, didn't you?

00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I wanted
to stay on the planet.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, if God had given
me a roster of jobs

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
that were available,
I don't know

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.570 align:middle line:84%
that I would have picked this
one back in 1969 because this

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:90%
wasn't even discussed openly.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:84%
People were afraid
of psychic abilities.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:90%
People were afraid of anything--

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they thought it
was woo woo and all that stuff.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I've watched the
evolution of people opening up

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
to their own psychic
ability over these years,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
which Theo told me
would be happening.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the commitment
I made then has

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.622 align:middle line:90%
kept me going, doing this work.

00:05:59.622 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now there are a
lot of channelers out there.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Mhm.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes you
different from them?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There are channelers
out there that not all of them

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:84%
allow the voice for themselves
to be taken over literally.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's
why I was described

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.180 align:middle line:84%
by the scientists I worked with
as a direct voice trance medium,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
because the messages
come directly through me.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not my voice.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:84%
My voice and vocal
cords are used,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
but I allow the energy to
come in to my entire body

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.315 align:middle line:90%
and speak directly.

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:40.118 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're
doing that are you

00:06:40.118 --> 00:06:41.285 align:middle line:90%
aware of what you're saying?

00:06:41.285 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I'm aware it's
going on but I don't retain it.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
control over your body?

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do not.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll find out when
we channel a little bit

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:90%
later on in the program.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at a clip that you

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
had about channeling Theo from
Gaia's documentary "Channeling,

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:90%
a Bridge to Beyond."

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the heart the central
station within us that allows us

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:84%
to hear, see, and feel messages
from beyond this dimension?

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.282 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart is the sacred
space of the human being.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Everything, all energy travels
in the blood through the heart

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and in circulation to
the entirety of the body,

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:90%
does it not?

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:10%
So the seat of the soul
is there informing--

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:51.070 align:middle line:10%
if you would-- all things
physical, emotional,

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:10%
psychological.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now that was you,
Sheila, but that was not you.

00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:56.625 align:middle line:90%
Was that Theo?

00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:57.708 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That was Theo.

00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now explain
Theo, these 12 archangels.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Theo came to me--

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:84%
originally I had a
spokesman, Folos,

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
that told me higher teachers
who were going to be coming

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and my body was being adjusted,
the frequencies in my body,

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
for the match of
higher teachers.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And when Theo came in,
they spoke and said,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:84%
this is the
beginning, is it not?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:90%
That's how it always starts.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And they said we are 12
archangels collectively known

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:90%
by the name Theo.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.009 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they take
turns talking through you?

00:08:35.009 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's interesting.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.000 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like one
voice continuously

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.730 align:middle line:90%
but I believe they do.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.360 align:middle line:84%
If you listen to
recordings back to back,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:84%
you can tell a
subtle difference.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a little
change, that's right.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Mhm.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I noticed that the last
time you were on the program.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I picked
that up a little bit.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.010 align:middle line:90%
What did they want?

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They are
here, as they've told us,

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.750 align:middle line:84%
for the consciousness
shifts that's

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.800 align:middle line:84%
happening right now in the
fifth dimensional energy

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.606 align:middle line:90%
in the human experience.

00:09:08.606 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's the level of
channeling, the fifth dimension?

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They say there's
12 dimensions about the Earth.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:84%
We are in and experiencing
the fifth now,

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:90%
which is this greater opening.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're seeing
so many people channeling.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.940 align:middle line:84%
We're all channels to one degree
or another in whatever we do.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Even me?

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, even you.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And in your work that you do you
are using that soul energy that

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:84%
is George in all things
that you do, as we all do.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
writers, some people

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:90%
are doctors, some people--

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:84%
whatever we do that is
our particular focus

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime is a form of
channeling our soul energy.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're all
connected to source.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they come into
you at their will or yours?

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Mine.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And they taught me that
right in the beginning.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:84%
They said, this is your life,
these are your life moments,

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and we are here to work
with you and through you.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And they taught me that
I would control the time

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.375 align:middle line:90%
that I would offer myself--

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and to be
utilized in that way.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And they insisted it be
that way because they

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:40.030 align:middle line:84%
said you have a human
life to live as well,

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.625 align:middle line:84%
and we are here
to work with you.

00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there any
research that kind of backs up

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:90%
what you've been saying?

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There's
been a lot of research

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
done by different scientists
about psychic abilities,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.570 align:middle line:84%
about people being
able to channel.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:84%
This isn't something new to
our human experience either.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's been
around for ages.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: History shows
us that there's always

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:90%
been seers, knowers, oracles.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:84%
There are different
words for it.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.910 align:middle line:90%
And in the early 19th--

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:84%
late 1800s and early 1900s,
the Theosophical Society

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:84%
became very prominent
in spiritualism.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
always been people

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:33.355 align:middle line:84%
who have been utilized as
speakers, let's say, of truth.

00:11:33.355 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, let's channel.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's channel Theo.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And I will ask you a
series of questions,

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:90%
and let's see what happens.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.986 align:middle line:84%
Now after the fact, do
you know what you've said?

00:11:43.986 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I'm aware of the
words that have been said.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
If you would discuss it with
me, there would be this, oh--

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A recollection?

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: A recollection.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's not-- I
couldn't come out

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, they said
this, this, and this.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
begin with Theo, please.

00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: OK, it'll
take just a few seconds.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:90%
It is the beginning, is it not?

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo, do you remember
me from our last engagement?

00:12:29.305 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We are
aware of you, yes.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good to have you back.

00:12:33.975 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We are appreciative
of the opportunity to serve.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:38.865 align:middle line:90%
You may ask.

00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has changed
since the last time we spoke?

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: What
you're observing

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:84%
is the chaos within
this world that

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:84%
is for the change
of consciousness

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:54.630 align:middle line:84%
in the human experience
and the recognition of each

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and every one of you being more
powerful than you know you are.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And coming into a solid
state of unconditional

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:84%
love of self, which
then radiates out

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.925 align:middle line:90%
into the world to bring peace.

00:13:08.925 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to be a
consciousness shift going on

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:90%
Do you sense that too?

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: We are aware of it.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:84%
We've been speaking
that this is happening,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:84%
this is the time
you're living in.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And each and every one
of you is a participant

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.810 align:middle line:90%
in this shift of consciousness.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:32.654 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
happening to humanity now?

00:13:32.654 --> 00:13:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Becoming aware of
more than you think you are.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Your souls are eternal, you're
having a human experience.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And coming into
this time, there's

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:49.165 align:middle line:84%
a greater awareness
of that power within.

00:13:49.165 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This kind of change,
as I'll call it, in humanity,

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
is it a positive thing
or a negative thing?

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's a
very positive thing.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:84%
However, to shift out of the old
paradigm, the old way of being

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:84%
that has been thousands
of years passed along,

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:15.940 align:middle line:84%
it is moving out of the old
default system of fright,

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
flight, fear, freeze
that was originated

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:84%
in the first humans
for survival and then

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
continuously, throughout every
generation, passed along.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Now you're breaking out of that
mold, that old way of being,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:90%
into a new default system.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
As you change limiting beliefs
in each and every one's minds,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
you're changing neural
pathways in the brain

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:51.956 align:middle line:84%
to a default system of greater
creativity and positivity.

00:14:51.956 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo, we seem
to be a planet of hate

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and wars, killings.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Is that ever going to stop?

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There will
be peace on your planet,

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.750 align:middle line:84%
but it comes from the
inner to the outer.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, it has been
such because survival

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:84%
has been such a
dominance in your minds

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and the feelings of
not enough, there's

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.820 align:middle line:90%
not enough for everybody.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And what we wish you
to know, there is.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And you're better together
than you are separate.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.690 align:middle line:90%
You're a collaborative species.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you compete at different
things that grow you

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:84%
but collaboration
is what you'll find

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.980 align:middle line:84%
to elevate this planet
in this consciousness.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And you will observe new
foundations, structures,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:84%
ways of being on the planet
that haven't been expressed up

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
until now as you
collaborate together,

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:84%
come together as the one
species that you are.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:90%
You all want the same things.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:84%
As a collective you
want a life well lived,

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:84%
love and be loved, all of the
things that make one's life

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.300 align:middle line:90%
a joy.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo, when you
look at a little child,

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
a little human
child, what do you

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.336 align:middle line:90%
think of that person's future?

00:16:26.336 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We see
the body is small,

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't mean the soul is.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And so this body is
here as the Earth suit,

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:84%
as the vehicle for this soul
to have an impact on human life

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and human existence
on this Earth planet.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And what will be
known by humans as we

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.770 align:middle line:84%
look at these young ones
that are to be participating

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:03.020 align:middle line:84%
in wayshowers in this new
world as the powerful beings

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:90%
that they are.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:84%
If you all could see
yourselves as we see you,

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:10.855 align:middle line:90%
there would be no discontent.

00:17:10.855 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheila
had mentioned to us

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.720 align:middle line:84%
earlier that there are
12 dimensions out there,

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and that we are in
the fifth right now.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:22.199 align:middle line:84%
What is the fifth compared to
the other seven, let's say?

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: The fifth is a
human experience in your body.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:84%
You're experiencing these
vibrational frequencies

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.430 align:middle line:84%
of the dimension that
are opening humans

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:84%
up even more to the possibility
and soul connectivity

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:90%
consciously.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And the sixth will be the
same of a fuller expression

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
of that power physically
on the planet.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.820 align:middle line:84%
The other six to
bring out the 12

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.375 align:middle line:84%
are the etheric dimensions,
their vibrational frequency

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:84%
is very refined, that allow
for greater creativity which

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:90%
you have access to consciously.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What gets us to these
various dimensional levels?

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: In this
time it's the change

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:84%
of the energy on the planet
and the body acclimating

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.540 align:middle line:90%
to this access.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the
higher dimensions

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
better than the
lower dimensions?

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: One is not
greater than another,

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:90%
they're just different.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like the notes
of a song, they're

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:90%
all important, aren't they?

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.375 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
vibrational frequencies.

00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:30.175 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: To have
the beauty of the song,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.325 align:middle line:84%
all are equally
important, are they not?

00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What gets us to
these other dimensions?

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.586 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: To be aware of
them, a conscious intention

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.680 align:middle line:84%
of awareness and
meditation is a key tool

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.172 align:middle line:90%
to have a greater awareness.

00:18:55.172 --> 00:18:58.976 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ascension, what
does that mean to you, Theo?

00:18:58.976 --> 00:19:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It means many
different things to many people,

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.790 align:middle line:84%
but what we would say here, it
is the path to enlightenment.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And what is enlightenment
but a lightness

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:15.080 align:middle line:84%
of being a lightness of
heart and a solid state

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.175 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love
for self and others.

00:19:18.175 --> 00:19:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there many
other living organisms

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.450 align:middle line:90%
out there in the universe?

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hundreds?

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Millions?

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Billions.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they
visited planet Earth?

00:19:31.745 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Some have, yes.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.775 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine that
your neighbor is one?

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can't imagine that.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Why we
say this is Earth

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:48.175 align:middle line:84%
is only one choice for
a soul to have a life.

00:19:48.175 --> 00:19:51.516 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes
Earth so special, Theo?

00:19:51.516 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: The beauty,
the experience of the body,

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:84%
the interactions with each
other in a physical way.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the devil,
where does the devil come in?

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's
a consciousness.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:90%
It is not a being.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Some embody what one might
call the devil, which is evil,

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
but it's all about how
one thinks about the self.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And each of you have
the power of utilizing

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:84%
energies that are of the
etheric nature, you might say,

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:35.110 align:middle line:84%
magical nature,
but it's a mindset,

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:90%
and often based in fear.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.552 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
turned down an assignment?

00:20:41.552 --> 00:20:43.935 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:20:43.935 --> 00:20:45.875 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who assigns you?

00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is that
source of unconditional love

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:90%
which you call God force.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:84%
There are many
words that have been

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.260 align:middle line:84%
used for it but in
the human existence,

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.110 align:middle line:84%
in all religion
and all language,

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:84%
there is a certain vibration
to the word of God,

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:90%
which is that sound of ah.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And we wish you all to
have ah in your life.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo, what
would you say you are?

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.515 align:middle line:84%
You're an archangel,
but what is that?

00:21:17.515 --> 00:21:21.640 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: You could say in
your chronological thinking

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:10%
in human experiences up until
now there is a hierarchy,

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:10%
but we like to say one is
not greater than another.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:84%
We could say we are managers
of the legions of angels.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever been a human?

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you wish you were?

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.715 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We get to experience
your humanness through you.

00:21:43.715 --> 00:21:47.672 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you wish you were
a human on a Saturday night.

00:21:47.672 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We have
the opportunity

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:56.115 align:middle line:84%
as we interact in this body to
experience some of this, yes.

00:21:56.115 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting,
that was a joke.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.175 align:middle line:90%
Do you laugh sometimes?

00:22:00.175 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: We find it humorous.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:84%
A Saturday night is the same
as a Friday to us as well.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Friday is not bad.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.712 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: We like your music.

00:22:11.712 --> 00:22:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind of music?

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: All music.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All kinds.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:84%
We've got some very talented
people on this planet.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:27.042 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Very much
so, highly talented.

00:22:27.042 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about planet Earth.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Is there hope for this planet?

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: This planet
will be here longer

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:90%
than the humans on it.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What will
happen to the humans?

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: When a
life is completed

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and one leaves their body,
their soul leaves the body,

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:84%
we call it birth
to birth, not birth

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:84%
to death, for you birth
into your human existence

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.660 align:middle line:84%
into this physical
structure for the life that

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:90%
is desired to be lived.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And when that is
completed, the decision

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:84%
of the soul to leave
the body buds back

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.565 align:middle line:84%
into the multidimensionality
of its existence.

00:23:08.565 --> 00:23:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
reincarnation mean to you, Theo?

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Choice.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Each human chooses to incarnate.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And know there are billions
of souls that would

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.240 align:middle line:90%
love to have a human body.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:90%
You won the lottery.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:27.595 align:middle line:90%
You got one.

00:23:27.595 --> 00:23:31.285 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The bodies that we
select, do we choose that?

00:23:31.285 --> 00:23:32.645 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:23:32.645 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So we have free will.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.890 align:middle line:84%
You are not demanded
to have a life.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:84%
It is a choice to learn
from the experiences

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.850 align:middle line:84%
to be had on this
planet in human form.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:53.482 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What upsets the
archangels more than anything?

00:23:53.482 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We don't get
upset or we don't judge.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
We see all things as
opportunities of growth

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:90%
and expansion experientially.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:13.440 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that would not
upset us but might upset you

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.485 align:middle line:84%
is if there was no growth
from the experiences that

00:24:17.485 --> 00:24:18.285 align:middle line:90%
are challenging.

00:24:18.285 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
mentioned that there

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:23.975 align:middle line:84%
are other Earth-like planets
teeming throughout the universe.

00:24:23.975 --> 00:24:25.625 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:27.945 align:middle line:84%
There's billions of them
in your solar system.

00:24:27.945 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the 12 archangels
under the guise of Theo

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.142 align:middle line:90%
handle all these planets?

00:24:35.142 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Handle, that's an
interesting way of description.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:84%
We would say in that
description, no, we

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.685 align:middle line:90%
are aware of them, however.

00:24:44.685 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there other
archangels for them?

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.465 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There are
24 archangelic beings.

00:24:51.465 --> 00:24:52.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Total.

00:24:52.965 --> 00:24:53.765 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:24:53.765 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.405 align:middle line:84%
But there are
billions of angels.

00:25:00.405 --> 00:25:03.100 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So who assigns
you to a planet?

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: As you
might think, one

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
in charge, which would
be God's source force.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Any words that you would use for
the ultimate energy of creation.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo, you mentioned
evil a little while back.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.015 align:middle line:90%
What does the evil mean to you?

00:25:25.015 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There
are individuals

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.760 align:middle line:84%
that do things that one
could describe as evil, that

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:90%
are harmful against another.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.592 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:25:42.592 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So we
see most often one

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:52.260 align:middle line:84%
that would block another's
growth, physically

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:59.364 align:middle line:84%
or spiritually, as
having evil intent.

00:25:59.364 --> 00:26:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What becomes of
these evil people eventually?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.996 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.996 --> 00:26:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Each life has
an expression within it

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:84%
that one must assess from
a different point of view

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.460 align:middle line:90%
than in their human existence.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:84%
But most often this
evil is perpetrated

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:84%
in ways that have been based
in fear and misinformation.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
communicating now

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
through a human body of a
woman named Sheila Gillette.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.970 align:middle line:90%
How did you pick her?

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Why did you pick her?

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So
there was a request.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From?

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: She requested
from source, from God.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She prayed.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:27:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And asked to be a vehicle for
a change, for information.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:08.220 align:middle line:84%
A vehicle in which we could
utilize and collaborate

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.930 align:middle line:84%
with to bring the message
of change, of consciousness,

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and how to do that
to the planet now,

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.220 align:middle line:84%
which is the full expression
of the fifth dimension.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She seems to be
a very enlightened person.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Did that happen after her
near-death experience?

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: She has been a
good student, a [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:90%
which is a disciple.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is she unusual
compared to other channelers?

00:27:35.385 --> 00:27:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: In the time
that she requested and chose

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.650 align:middle line:84%
to participate there
was a difference, yes,

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.800 align:middle line:90%
but there is no difference.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of you
has energy of creation

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:84%
which you could call a
channeling of that energy.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We seem to have a
world of various religions

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:84%
all believing in
a monotheist God,

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:84%
but we have different belief
systems, different thoughts.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.955 align:middle line:90%
Is that confusing?

00:28:11.955 --> 00:28:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The one thought of unconditional
love is a constant.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And the love of self
has been a message

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.570 align:middle line:84%
from all who have been
the greater teachers

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:90%
of these particular religions.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But as we stated,
within all religions

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:middle line:84%
there is the one tone of a God,
vibration of a God, and message.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:84%
However, then as humans
have led these religions,

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:53.490 align:middle line:84%
they have influenced from
their own human experience laws

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and regulations that were
not voiced by the one God

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:90%
but were of human content.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever wish
you were in a human body?

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Not like you are in Sheila
but as an existing human body?

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We have
not wished such.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.095 align:middle line:84%
If we had, we
would have done it.

00:29:16.095 --> 00:29:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you wish you had
the same earthly pleasures

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.100 align:middle line:90%
as humans do?

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Eating, drinking, sleeping.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's an
interesting concept.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.885 align:middle line:90%
We would have to say no.

00:29:27.885 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is there so
much pain on this planet?

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have to
go through that?

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's a
challenge, isn't it?

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And each soul chooses
opportunities of growth.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Challenge is only the
curriculum of life experience

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.920 align:middle line:90%
to learn emotions.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we evolving?

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, you are.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.425 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've
been speaking about.

00:29:52.425 --> 00:29:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's next for us?

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: A new world,
ultimately, out of this chaos,

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:02.840 align:middle line:84%
for what is happening
is all the foundations

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that have been passed along for
centuries, thousands of years

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:07.400 align:middle line:90%
are crumbling.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:90%
They don't work anymore.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And there is this recognition of
a global species of which humans

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:19.730 align:middle line:84%
are a global species,
as all species are

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:84%
to some degree in
different form.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:84%
But the humans are here to have
this evolution of consciousness

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:90%
to ultimately have peace.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:37.520 align:middle line:84%
What one would think a
utopia, to some degree,

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.460 align:middle line:84%
in a good way where
you love each other

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:44.754 align:middle line:84%
and collaborate for the
highest good of all.

00:30:44.754 --> 00:30:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
you categorize

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:51.360 align:middle line:84%
this discussion you're having
with a human being right now?

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We appreciate
the opportunity

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to have it for that's
what changes the minds.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And what changes
your environment,

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:07.420 align:middle line:84%
your lives on this planet
is a change of mindset.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Laying new neural
pathways in your brain

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and releasing the old default
system of fear and fright.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Fear and faith ask
the same of you,

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.230 align:middle line:84%
to believe in something
that is unseen.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And being the
creators that you are,

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:32.655 align:middle line:84%
you can create in your
experience what you want.

00:31:32.655 --> 00:31:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the archangels
ever get together and say,

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:40.186 align:middle line:84%
you won't believe what
this human just did.

00:31:40.186 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We are together
energetically and vibrationally

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.460 align:middle line:90%
and we observe--

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:84%
you think of humor, we
find ourselves humorous

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.870 align:middle line:84%
but you take us so seriously
for in that observation

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:58.180 align:middle line:84%
of human experience, there are
those moments when we would say,

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.860 align:middle line:90%
they're doing it again.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.681 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo, how do we
bring Sheila back now?

00:32:04.681 --> 00:32:06.855 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You are
complete with your asking.

00:32:06.855 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.535 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We will depart
and she will return.

00:32:11.535 --> 00:32:14.250 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.885 align:middle line:90%
God's love unto you.

00:32:15.885 --> 00:32:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.045 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Good day.

00:32:18.045 --> 00:32:31.048 align:middle line:90%


00:32:31.048 --> 00:32:32.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that you, Sheila?

00:32:32.345 --> 00:32:33.145 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:32:33.145 --> 00:32:33.945 align:middle line:90%
Hi, George.

00:32:33.945 --> 00:32:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now do you have any
recollection of what Theo just

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.380 align:middle line:90%
said through you?

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:90%


00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Not--
I know it happened.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's pretty
profound, by the way.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: The words.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:52.840 align:middle line:84%
If I would listen or
watch this recording, I--

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:56.200 align:middle line:84%
there would be some memory
or, I remember that now.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.970 align:middle line:90%
That's very vague but--

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.185 align:middle line:90%
it's not a total recall.

00:32:59.185 --> 00:33:01.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're very
complimentary of you.

00:33:01.355 --> 00:33:02.605 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Well, that's nice.

00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But where are you
when they're speaking?

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Your body's functioning
but, I mean,

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:18.670 align:middle line:84%
you have no ability to call on
your kids or anything like that.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's interesting
you bring that up, you know.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:25.090 align:middle line:10%
My children were
very, very young

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.200 align:middle line:10%
when this all started
happening to me.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.270 align:middle line:10%
In fact, my youngest
daughter was just a baby

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:34.160 align:middle line:10%
as it was her birth
that brought this on.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And so having small
children in the home,

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I would have Theo
speaking through me.

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And if they needed something,
Theo would just stop talking

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and say to my assistant
who was recording,

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.890 align:middle line:90%
the young ones need assistance.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And then she'd
come back and we'd

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:90%
start recording again next word.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:01.970 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't even go,
what were we saying?

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Like we humans do.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.390 align:middle line:90%
They just pick it right up.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.888 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a book called
"The Art of Relationship."

00:34:07.888 --> 00:34:08.688 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:34:08.688 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well,
it's been revised.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.820 align:middle line:90%
It's 12 chapters.

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.279 align:middle line:84%
It's all about relationship,
first and foremost.

00:34:16.279 --> 00:34:17.989 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With another human?

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But first to the self or
the relationship of the self

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.254 align:middle line:90%
is most important.

00:34:23.254 --> 00:34:24.054 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:34:24.054 --> 00:34:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And then to
everything else relational,

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:33.630 align:middle line:84%
primary relationships, children,
work relationships, family,

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:84%
even end of life relationship,
as we call it the end of life.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.300 align:middle line:90%
There are 12 chapters.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's in reference to
all our relationships.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Theo says everything
we do is relational.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's
true in life, isn't it?

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:54.170 align:middle line:84%
We're in relationship
to the grocery clerk

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.770 align:middle line:84%
that we give our money
to when we're paying.

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:01.260 align:middle line:84%
You and I are in relationship
now in this conversation.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.575 align:middle line:84%
So everything we do is in
relationship to others.

00:35:04.575 --> 00:35:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In all the years
you've been channeling,

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:12.040 align:middle line:84%
have you sensed a change in
what's happening out there?

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.465 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh yes, yes.

00:35:13.465 --> 00:35:15.756 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For the good or bad?

00:35:15.756 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I see it--

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.155 align:middle line:90%
I'm very optimistic.

00:35:18.155 --> 00:35:19.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are upbeat.

00:35:19.535 --> 00:35:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I think you have to
be in life, though.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't imagine
life not being positive.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, do
you ever get upset?

00:35:30.435 --> 00:35:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Sure.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're human.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah, of course.

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I've been a good
student of Theo's wisdom on how

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to make the changes in me
to be at peace in my life,

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:46.730 align:middle line:90%
and how to--

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.580 align:middle line:84%
to the point of how to
interact in my relationships.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
ever tap into Theo

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.495 align:middle line:90%
personally for your own self?

00:35:53.495 --> 00:35:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:84%
I can hear them,
they can speak to me

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.465 align:middle line:90%
as when I first heard Jesus.

00:35:59.465 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sheila, don't do that.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Sheila, what are you doing?

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Does it work like that?

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.645 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Well, it could.

00:36:05.645 --> 00:36:08.400 align:middle line:90%


00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.000 align:middle line:84%
If I were in peril or if
something dangerous was

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.390 align:middle line:84%
going to happen, I could feel
them, they would say something.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.570 align:middle line:84%
But my husband Marcus,
if I have questions

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:21.450 align:middle line:84%
like you were
asking questions, he

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.195 align:middle line:84%
will ask them for me because
then I can have a recording.

00:36:24.195 --> 00:36:28.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How is he handling
your channeling, your husband?

00:36:28.725 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: He works with me.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:34.180 align:middle line:90%
We do the Theo work together.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.905 align:middle line:84%
And we met because
of my channeling.

00:36:36.905 --> 00:36:37.705 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:36:37.705 --> 00:36:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: He read
my first book--

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.910 align:middle line:84%
"The Fifth Dimension
Channels to a New Reality,"

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:middle line:90%
he read that book.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He fell in love
with you reading the book.

00:36:46.045 --> 00:36:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, he said
he wanted to meet me.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now did he
get any help from Theo?

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I think our
meeting was assisted

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.190 align:middle line:90%
by that, by reading the book.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I think he understood
who I was and then asked

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:12.460 align:middle line:84%
or a friend asked me to come
and meet friends of hers.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:90%
She didn't even say who it was.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does he channel?

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.415 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: In his own way, yes.

00:37:17.415 --> 00:37:19.592 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through with Theo?

00:37:19.592 --> 00:37:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: No, he gets
information very visually.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes he gets
information in his own way.

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:34.990 align:middle line:90%
He's been a student as well.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he's pretty
well tuned in, isn't he?

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: He is.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And he's worked now
with me for 26 years.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.950 align:middle line:90%
And he knows Theo very well.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And he is a great
question asker.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the
day comes, Sheila,

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:55.990 align:middle line:84%
that you leave the human
body, where will you go?

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's not a
place, I don't think.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I think it's-- I'll just
go into the recognition

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.535 align:middle line:84%
of the vibrational frequencies
or multidimensionality energy.

00:38:06.535 --> 00:38:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will Theo
bring you along?

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I think Theo
will be there, for sure.

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:14.110 align:middle line:90%
I have no doubt about that.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At your bedside?

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, probably.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever seen them?

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:19.930 align:middle line:84%
What do they look like
if you've seen them?

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You know,
I ask them one time.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was in my living
room and I said,

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.870 align:middle line:90%
I'd really like to see you.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
phenomenal that it's

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:33.340 align:middle line:84%
like this shaft of
light came down.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.410 align:middle line:90%
It came through my ceiling.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:39.475 align:middle line:84%
And it was a beautiful
shimmering aqua--

00:38:39.475 --> 00:38:40.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of energy?

00:38:40.375 --> 00:38:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Of energy.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:46.240 align:middle line:84%
It kind of had gold on the
sides of it, and it was--

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.585 align:middle line:84%
the energy of it was
like not overwhelming.

00:38:49.585 --> 00:38:51.605 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that was
what Theo was, energy?

00:38:51.605 --> 00:38:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's
what they showed me.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've never showed
you how they look as a human

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:58.404 align:middle line:84%
or with wings or
anything like that?

00:38:58.404 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: No, but
I have had a fantasy,

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:06.870 align:middle line:10%
let's say, of Theo, the
group of them sitting around

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.940 align:middle line:10%
like a big oval
conference table.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.750 align:middle line:10%
And when somebody asks
a question, whoever's

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:18.270 align:middle line:10%
the smartest one on that topic
goes, I'll take this one,

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.570 align:middle line:10%
and they answer.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:84%
But that's been in my mind
just because it's comfortable,

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:26.155 align:middle line:84%
it's known in our
human experience.

00:39:26.155 --> 00:39:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheila Gillette,
how do people track your work

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.670 align:middle line:90%
or get a hold of you?

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We have
a great website.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.380 align:middle line:10%
It's called asktheo.com,
and everything's there.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: T H E O.

00:39:36.745 --> 00:39:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: T H E O.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Asktheo.com.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank you for
being on the program again.

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I've so enjoyed
being with you, George.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: She's been
on two times with me

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:50.680 align:middle line:10%
and each time she's on, I learn
something a little bit more

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.270 align:middle line:10%
about Theo and the
archangels and ourselves.

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
