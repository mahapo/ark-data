00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JIM MYERS: I've believed in
sasquatch since I was a child.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.078 align:middle line:84%
Once into it, it
kind of grabs you.

00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:16.828 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: You
were obsessed with it.

00:00:16.828 --> 00:00:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: I was obsessed.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Extraterrestrial,
something dimensional.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:90%
What does your gut tell you?

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I have
three now stories

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.040 align:middle line:84%
of people who say that they
were healed by a sasquatch.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.112 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:00:30.112 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Something grabbed
my bed and shook it.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And I yelled, and I
had something pushing

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.360 align:middle line:90%
on the outside of the tent.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:84%
If I'd had more guts, I
would have put my hand--

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pushed back.

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: --and pushed
back, but I was too afraid.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you convinced
beyond a shadow of a doubt--

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: 100%

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that
something's going on?

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: 100%.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.157 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.157 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, thanks for
joining us on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And we've got one of
those cliffhanger shows

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.490 align:middle line:90%
for you tonight.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Jim Myers is with us.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:10%
An avid outdoorsman, he enjoys
hunting, fishing, hiking,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:10%
and camping, and all those
great things that go with that.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:10%
But for the past eight
years, why don't we

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:10%
add to that list a sasquatch
researcher and museum curator?

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Jim, welcome to the program.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.785 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Thank you, George.

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in sasquatch research?

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:10%
>>MYERS: It's quite
a story, actually.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.060 align:middle line:10%
I've believed in Sasquatch
since I was a child.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Ever since the movie
"The Legend of Boggy Creek"

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.790 align:middle line:90%
was made in the '70s.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.348 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:30.348 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:10%
>>MYERS: But it's only
since we moved to Colorado

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:10%
in about 2009.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:10%
Two things happened
that were key.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:90%
I own a store.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And as I was
renovating the store,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I met my first
bigfoot eyewitness.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And she was a local to Bailey,
a very credible person.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.440 align:middle line:90%
And I took her to coffee.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:90%
We talked about her experience.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:90%
She convinced me.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the show "Finding
Bigfoot" from Animal Planet

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:84%
came and did an
episode in Bailey.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And I went to that showing
and talked to the actors.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of launched me
into this kind of unexpectedly

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:90%
on my side.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
But once into it, it
kind of grabs you,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't get away.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.588 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
obsessed with it.

00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: I was obsessed.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.698 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
seen a bigfoot yourself?

00:02:20.698 --> 00:02:22.775 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I have seen a
bigfoot one time visually.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.482 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us that story.

00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: There's a lake
that's a very popular tourist

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:84%
destination about 13
miles from Bailey.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:90%
It's called Wellington Lake.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Big with campers, hikers.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And because it's a hotspot
for bigfoot sightings

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and vocalizations, we
were camping there.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:84%
We went out early in the
morning to go do some fishing.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Everyone else in the campsite
was asleep as far as I knew.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a mountain,
a rock mountain,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:84%
at one end of the lake
called the Castle.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And the rocks kind of
come around the sides

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.150 align:middle line:90%
of the lake a little ways.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:90%
And I was fishing.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:90%
I fly fish.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I had just cast, and I
was just looking around.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:90%
And I looked up to my right.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big rock
outcropping maybe 200 yards

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was something
standing up there looking down.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:90%
I could tell it was very large.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.450 align:middle line:90%
It was uniform in color.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And of course, right at that
moment, as fate would have it,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:90%
a fish pulled on my line.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So I turned to look at the
fish, and I looked back.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And it was gone.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.245 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone that quickly.

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: That quickly.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did it--
did it seem human?

00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: It did not--

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't a human.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:90%
I could tell that.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:84%
But it was human-like, and
it was standing on two legs,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.460 align:middle line:90%
looking down from the rock.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get the sense
it was looking at me.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:84%
It was just looking
downwards towards the lake.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it saw me, and
that's why it disappeared.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.788 align:middle line:90%
But I learned a lesson.

00:03:54.788 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Never take your eyes off of
a sasquatch if you see one.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're that quick.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Yeah.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a caller on my
radio show, "Coast to Coast

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.800 align:middle line:90%
AM," several years ago.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And the person was fishing
on the side of a creek,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:90%
much like you were.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:90%
And he caught two trout.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And he's holding
up these two trout.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
He looks up, and
there's a bigfoot

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.650 align:middle line:90%
looking at him 10 feet away.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Wow.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Staring at
him and the trout.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, this guy's scared to death.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Of course.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He hands the trout
to the bigfoot, both of them.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoot takes them, looks at
the guy, gives him one back.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: That's
quite an experience.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, if that
was a true story, that

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
tells you that they have
some kind of thought process,

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.715 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: I believe they do.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I would say their
intelligence rivals ours,

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:84%
or even surpasses
ours in some areas.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
are seeing or sighting

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.333 align:middle line:90%
these bigfoot stories?

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: It's hard
to say, George.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I would-- the best
estimate that I

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:84%
could give based on a number
of different databases

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that are out there is 50,000
to 60,000 sightings just

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow!

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, there have been
so many encounters--

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Yes.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.275 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that you created the
Sasquatch Encounter Museum--

00:05:18.275 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Yes.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in Bailey, Colorado.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Correct.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.862 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's look.

00:05:21.862 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: So we're about
to enter the inner sanctum

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
of the Sasquatch Outpost, which
is the Sasquatch Encounter

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Discovery Museum.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.212 align:middle line:84%
So if you come with
me, we'll head on in.

00:05:52.084 --> 00:05:59.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:84%
This is a loop of recordings
from around the country

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:84%
of sasquatch vocalizations,
different types,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:84%
as you can hear them laughing,
talking, howling, whooping.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to give
people some idea of what

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:90%
does a sasquatch sound like.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And as you can hear,
they actually talk.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.800 align:middle line:90%
They have their own language.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.540 align:middle line:84%
This is something that we
found back in about 2013.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I found a set of elk tracks
where the elk was actually

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.680 align:middle line:90%
running.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was defecating as it ran,
which I thought was unusual.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I followed the
tracks until I came

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
upon this imprint of an
elk's body in the snow,

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:90%
like an elk stamp.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:10%
It's like it was running, and it
hit the snow and stopped dead.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.240 align:middle line:10%
And I could see the legs.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.100 align:middle line:10%
I could see the neck, the head.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:10%
This elk did not move
once it hit the snow.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Then we noticed
another set of tracks

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.200 align:middle line:84%
coming from a different
direction that

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
were 10 to 12 feet
apart with every stride.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And the two sets of tracks
converged right here

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:90%
where this elk was in the snow.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the big
tracks just carried on.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And our assumption is this
elk was somehow knocked down

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.310 align:middle line:84%
by a sasquatch, which then
picked it up, and carried it

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:84%
off, which is probably 400
or 500 pounds dead weight.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Given that there were no elk
tracks leaving this location,

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
the only explanation
we could come up with

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
is that it was picked
up and carried off.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way to know if
sasquatch is active in an area

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
is looking for what
they do with trees.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And tree breaks is the most
common one that we find,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:84%
where trees are broken
and left hanging always

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
the same way, or
tree arches, which

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.430 align:middle line:84%
are trees that are bent over,
and then stuck in the ground

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
or stuck under another tree
to keep this arch shape.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I've seen these
up to 15 feet high coming down,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and then stuck in the
ground maybe a foot

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:90%
to keep that tree bent.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:90%
These are classic signs.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And I find them everywhere
I go in Colorado.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So I have a few examples of
what we're talking about when

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:90%
it comes to tree breaks.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:84%
This is a classic one,
where it's twisted and bent.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:90%
This one is unusual.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:84%
We found this near
the Wigwam trail.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And this tree was green
when it was found.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And it had been twisted
off like a bottle cap.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.560 align:middle line:84%
The amount of strength it would
take in the grip of a hand

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:84%
to twist this off, and then
drop it is unbelievable.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.179 align:middle line:84%
This is a map that we've had
since we started the museum.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:84%
And every pin on
here is a story,

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and every story was told
to myself or my wife.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:84%
The red ones are actual visual
sightings of a sasquatch.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.530 align:middle line:84%
The yellow ones have to do with
some kind of a tree structure

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.850 align:middle line:90%
like we spoke about.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Black are footprints.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Green is some kind
of a vocalization.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And blue is an object
that was thrown at someone

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:90%
while they were out hiking.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:90%
So this is the whole state.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.200 align:middle line:90%
This is Bailey right here.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But there were so many
sightings in Bailey

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I had to blow it up and create a
second map just of the activity

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:90%
around here.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:90%
So you can see.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I think there's over
300 pins on the map.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And again, this
is just people who

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
have talked to me
about their sightings.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So imagine how many
other people have

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:90%
seen a sasquatch in Colorado.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.008 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds like
an exciting museum.

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Well, I hope so.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's only
an hour away from where

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:90%
we're taping right now.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Correct.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.595 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:09:41.595 --> 00:09:43.345 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think there's
so many sightings

00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:90%
in the Bailey, Colorado area?

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: You know,
I'm not convinced

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:84%
that there's more sightings
in Bailey than anywhere else.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I think the fact that our
store and museum are in Bailey

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
draws people who've seen them
to come and tell their story.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But I'm convinced if my
store was based anywhere

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.840 align:middle line:84%
in the Rockies, there would be
that many sightings around it.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There would?

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: It's just
there's that many.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.767 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, how many
little dot buttons did you

00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:09.810 align:middle line:90%
have up there?

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.443 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Around 300.

00:10:11.443 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: It is.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For a
geographical area.

00:10:15.805 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: They're not
all around Bailey.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole
state of Colorado.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:84%
But those are people
who have come.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:84%
To my knowledge,
we're the only people

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.590 align:middle line:84%
they've ever told
their story to.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.262 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the
sightings seasonal?

00:10:28.262 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Well, in
the winter people

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:90%
aren't in the woods as much.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we typically get far more
in spring, summer, and fall.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:84%
But they're still
active in the winter.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:90%
We've found tracks.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:84%
We've found other
signs that they're

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:90%
out there moving around.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But there's just not
people to see them.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looking at
the illustrations--

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and we've seen many
over the years--

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:84%
the creature looks like
it could be an ape,

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:84%
but it's more upright,
more human-looking.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.985 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's like that
missing bridge, that link?

00:10:58.985 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I've been
asked that before.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And people have
asked me is sasquatch

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:09.470 align:middle line:84%
a descendant of gigantopithecus,
which was an extinct great ape.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Personally, I don't think so.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
don't think so is

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
there's no fossil record
of sasquatch, for one.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.560 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing is that
they are so human-like.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
They're bipedal, their
intelligence level.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They reason.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.365 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: They reason.

00:11:26.365 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
They have a language that's
very similar to our language.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't think an
extinct ape had that.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they're far
more human than not

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:84%
is why I believe that
they're not an extinct--

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:84%
a relative of an
extinct great ape.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There have been some
DNA studies on hair samples

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and things like that, and they
do show strange anomalies here,

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: They do.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And it actually shows
that sasquatch is probably

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:84%
a human hybrid, that they are
part human and part unknown.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: The unknown means
in the genome database

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.820 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't appear.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not there.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have heard, Jim, that
it's an Earth-based creature,

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:84%
like you just said,
extraterrestrial, something

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.655 align:middle line:90%
dimensional.

00:12:15.655 --> 00:12:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I think these theories come
out from all over the place.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.038 align:middle line:90%
What does your gut tell you?

00:12:21.038 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: If you had asked
me that 10 years ago, I

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.540 align:middle line:84%
would have said, they're
only a flesh and blood

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:90%
creature of some kind.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.520 align:middle line:84%
But I've had so many experiences
and know personally so

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
many people who've
had experiences,

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
such as a sasquatch disappearing
in front of their eyes,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.690 align:middle line:84%
literally disappearing, or
seeing something cloaked

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:84%
in the woods where you can
see it, but it's not there,

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
that I am convinced
that they do not

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.020 align:middle line:90%
exist only in this dimension.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:90%
They go somewhere else.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell
you where that is.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
they're only physical.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I think there's more to them
than purely what we can see.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: ET?

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Possibly.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are they-- if
they're a human hybrid,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:90%
when did that mix happen--

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: --is the question.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.485 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And were they dumped
here or do they come and go?

00:13:13.485 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Correct.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows?

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
What is the Sasquatch Outpost?

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: So the
Sasquatch Outpost

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:84%
is both a store, where we
sell sasquatch souvenirs,

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and an experience, the
Sasquatch Encounter.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And I try to separate those
by saying the store is where

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:90%
we have fun with sasquatch.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:84%
We have lots of funny
T-shirts and mugs.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.040 align:middle line:84%
But once you enter the Sasquatch
Encounter, it's all business.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making fun.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to educate people
and describe for them what

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.062 align:middle line:90%
we believe sasquatch is.

00:13:47.062 --> 00:13:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's look
at more with your Encounter

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Museum, and see some of the
things that are going on there.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.491 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: OK.

00:13:53.491 --> 00:13:57.387 align:middle line:90%

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.300 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of plaster
casts in the museum

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:84%
from different places
in the country.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:84%
But this one I wanted to
talk about, because this

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
is one of the
castings from the 1967

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:84%
filming of the Patterson-Gimlin
film of sasquatch,

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.770 align:middle line:90%
the most famous footage to date.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
Patty's footprints

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:84%
that was taken and
cast in the sand

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.820 align:middle line:90%
that she had walked through.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the
size of the footprint.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:84%
The estimate is that she was 7
feet 6 inches tall and weighed

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.080 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in the realm
of 900 pounds based

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
on the depth of her
track in the sand

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
compared to humans who had
walked in the same sand.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And of all the
castings I have, this

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.250 align:middle line:90%
is probably the most famous.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to show you
something kind of unique.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a knuckle
print of a sasquatch

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:59.260 align:middle line:84%
that was cast by Paul Freeman
in 1982 in Washington.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:90%
And you can see the size.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:90%
This is a left-hand knuckle.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, it was in the mud.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:84%
But just look at
the size of that

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:84%
compared to my hand,
the enormous hands

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.830 align:middle line:90%
that sasquatch have.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can see detail
on the top of the bones

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and the top of the knuckles.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just a unique cast that
I've never seen anywhere else.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, something that
a lot of people

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.060 align:middle line:84%
don't realize about
sasquatch is that

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
every Native American tribe
that I have encountered

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:84%
has their own name for sasquatch
and their own tradition

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:90%
about sasquatch.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:84%
To me this is one of the
most compelling proofs

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:90%
that they exist.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, why would every
Native American tribe

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:84%
believe in them,
talk about them,

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:84%
have an oral
tradition about them?

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:10%
And the interesting
thing is every name

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.080 align:middle line:10%
they give to sasquatch is a
name of people, not animals.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And so most Native
Americans would

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.890 align:middle line:84%
say that sasquatch
is another tribe.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
They're just a different
kind of people than we are.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is one of the
most compelling proofs,

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.218 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, for the
existence of sasquatch.

00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.220 align:middle line:90%
And those feet were huge.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: They are huge.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
18 to 20 inches at
times, maybe longer.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's a female.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what
Jimmy Choo or Steve

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.284 align:middle line:84%
Madden would be doing to
make a shoe for that person?

00:16:23.284 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's huge.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Yeah.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:90%
And they're wide.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.500 align:middle line:84%
They're long, and
they're very wide.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's from
the Patterson-Gimlin film,

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: That
casting was actually

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.090 align:middle line:90%
made a few days before.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.750 align:middle line:84%
We assume it was from Patty, but
it was made in the same area--

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:90%
taken in the same area.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could you
tell it's a female?

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: She had breasts.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:84%
The breasts bounced
as she walked.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.770 align:middle line:84%
I have a good friend who's
a plastic surgeon who has

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:90%
studied that film at length.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And he says he can tell not only
that it's a female, that she

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:84%
was middle-aged, she'd
already had offspring

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:06.490 align:middle line:84%
based on the fat deposits on
her body, and things like that.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But she-- the breasts are
the most obvious indicator

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:90%
that she was a female.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.819 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why isn't
science doing more

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:16.390 align:middle line:84%
of a job to try to uncover
this incredible mystery?

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: That is the
question of the hour, George.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about that
often among researchers.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Why does
science have such a bias

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.792 align:middle line:84%
against acknowledging the
existence of sasquatch

00:17:28.792 --> 00:17:30.417 align:middle line:84%
with all the evidence
that's out there?

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's nothing formal.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:84%
There's never been a
formal investigation,

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.957 align:middle line:90%
has there, by science?

00:17:35.957 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Well, I mean, if you
take aside the Sasquatch Genome

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Project, which
was, in my opinion,

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:84%
very scientifically done,
no, not that I'm aware of.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't mean that
there haven't been studies

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.660 align:middle line:84%
by the government that
we're just not aware of.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.010 align:middle line:90%
But I really don't know.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
could be the goal

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:90%
of hiding that information.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they afraid of?

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: You know, unless they
know something about sasquatch

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:84%
For instance, is
sasquatch somehow related

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.235 align:middle line:84%
to disappearing people
in this country?

00:18:13.235 --> 00:18:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The great David
Paulides, of course,

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:84%
has uncovered stories of
people disappearing in parks.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:84%
But as David and I
have talked about,

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:84%
if it were an animal or a
sasquatch grabbing people,

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:84%
somebody would be
screaming, whether it was

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.890 align:middle line:90%
the being or the individual.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Right.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:33.523 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Believe me.

00:18:33.523 --> 00:18:35.898 align:middle line:84%
Jim, if you were in the
woods and you got attacked,

00:18:35.898 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to go quietly.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: No.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.840 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
not hearing that.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Right.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's rule
that out for a moment,

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.850 align:middle line:84%
that sasquatch is abducting
people and stuff like that.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Right.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are bodies of
humans showing up anywhere

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:84%
in the woods eaten or
anything like that?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I mean, if
you go back in history

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:84%
there are stories
of that happening.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And even the Native Americans
talk about in their history

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
a sasquatch kidnapping
children and their women.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
What they did with them,
I'm not sure is known.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:84%
But there are anecdotal
stories about sasquatch taking,

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.510 align:middle line:90%
and killing, and eating people.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously,
the vast majority

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:84%
of encounters that I'm
aware of are very brief.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
The person will
see the sasquatch,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.070 align:middle line:90%
and then they're gone.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.510 align:middle line:90%
There's no violence involved.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: But there
are stories that

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.242 align:middle line:84%
involve violence and the person
surviving that encounter.

00:19:36.242 --> 00:19:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So there some.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Mhm.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There are some.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:84%
My encounter when I was
younger to this creature

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.990 align:middle line:84%
started when I
would read stories

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.810 align:middle line:84%
about the abominable
snowman in the Himalayas.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there a similarity here
between these creatures?

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I believe
it's the same creature.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
where they're located.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the yeti, I
don't believe is white.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're
brown, or reddish brown,

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:84%
very similar to our
bigfoot or sasquatch.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And every continent virtually
has a version of the sasquatch.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
They just go by different
names, the almas in Russia,

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:84%
the yeren in China,
and so forth.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.077 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had asked me
other bigfoot researchers

00:20:20.077 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:90%
that I've talked to.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
One was Rhettman Mullis, who
is a great researcher who

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:90%
talked about DNA testing.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.315 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Mhm.

00:20:29.315 --> 00:20:31.482 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
we're talking about here?

00:20:31.482 --> 00:20:34.560 align:middle line:90%
What is this creature?

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RHETTMAN MULLIS: My thinking
has evolved over the years.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.048 align:middle line:10%
Back in the '90s I worked
with Dr. Grover Krantz out

00:20:40.048 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:10%
of Washington State University.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:10%
And I used to collect
evidence for him.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.510 align:middle line:10%
And he had the
gigantopithecus theory.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:10%
So I kind of--

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.715 align:middle line:10%
I did hold out for a while.

00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which is an
ape-like creature.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: It's an extinct ape.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But over time when
I started learning

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.960 align:middle line:84%
more about the indigenous
tribes lore of them

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.230 align:middle line:84%
mating with human
females, that made

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.810 align:middle line:84%
me realize they had to be
closer to humans genetically.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: So I evolved that--

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For it to work, right?

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So I evolved that thinking,
and said, well, it can't--

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:84%
in my mind, it can't
be gigantopithecus.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
It has to be some
other form of closer

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.890 align:middle line:90%
relic or sub-genus human.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
trying to figure out

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:84%
now with all this DNA
research that we're doing.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
about that DNA research?

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I think there needs
to be more DNA research.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I think there-- we'll
learn more about sasquatch.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And I believe there are ways
that people can get samples

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:84%
of hair, even blood, that
can lend a lot of evidence

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:90%
to what they are.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Are they human hybrid or
are they something else?

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, he mentioned
interbreeding with sasquatch,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
which I think is in the
realm of possibility.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.410 align:middle line:10%
I think their DNA could
be close enough to ours

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:10%
that that could produce
viable offspring.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there are stories
out of Russia from the '50s,

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
'40s, '50s, I believe,
where a female sasquatch

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.910 align:middle line:84%
was captured, and then bred
with humans and had offspring

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:12.875 align:middle line:90%
that were viable.

00:22:12.875 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they look like?

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: They looked as--

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.990 align:middle line:84%
initially, looked
like hairy humans.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.420 align:middle line:84%
The further they
got away genetically

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:84%
from that first pairing, they
looked less like a sasquatch.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:84%
But there's not a lot of
photographic evidence.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
much I believe everything

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:90%
that I've read about that.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.272 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:34.272 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: But Jacko,
I think, is the name

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:90%
they gave to that sasquatch.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
must still be alive?

00:22:40.655 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: No.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.390 align:middle line:84%
This was-- as I said,
it was 50, 60 years ago.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
live that long?

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: That's a good question.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:90%
We don't know, actually.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:84%
There have been
habituations where

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:84%
people have lived in proximity
to sasquatch over 50 years

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and have watched them grow and
age to where the sasquatch was

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:90%
completely gray.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:84%
So one would tend to think
that they live at least as

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:90%
long as we do, probably longer.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But I don't get the idea that
they live 200 years or more.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Their life span is roughly
similar to ours, I would think.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you imagine,
Jim, people driving down

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:84%
a rural road at night,
and across the road

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.470 align:middle line:90%
walks a bigfoot.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:32.640 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be one of the most
frightening and awe-inspiring

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:90%
scenes you could come across.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: The word road is
the most common word in all

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.765 align:middle line:90%
the sasquatch sighting reports.

00:23:39.765 --> 00:23:40.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it?

00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: So more people
see them crossing the road

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:43.800 align:middle line:90%
than any other way.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lumbering,
just walking?

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: No, they
tend to go quickly.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.645 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
funny thing, George.

00:23:49.645 --> 00:23:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a deer?

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I've heard of them
running faster than a deer,

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes it's
just stepping.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:90%
But their stride is so huge.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.240 align:middle line:84%
It takes three
steps, and they're

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
across a typical
two-lane highway.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: But they typically
don't look at the vehicle.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And because I believe
their level of intelligence

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.250 align:middle line:84%
is extremely high, my
question is, why did they

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.500 align:middle line:90%
cross in front of the vehicle?

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.630 align:middle line:84%
They could wait 5 seconds
and be in darkness.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
vehicle goes by.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: And I'm convinced that
they do it because they want

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.018 align:middle line:90%
to be seen by that vehicle.

00:24:24.018 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
intelligence then.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Sure.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is
interesting, to be sure.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
As we tape, it's 0 degrees
here in Louisville, Colorado.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:90%
0 degrees.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.940 align:middle line:84%
These creatures are living
outside, or in caves,

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.670 align:middle line:84%
or in little huts
that they might make.

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:90%
How can they survive that?

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:90%
That's cold!

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.385 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: That's very cold.

00:24:47.385 --> 00:24:47.610 align:middle line:90%
That's very cold.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
care where you are.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.117 align:middle line:90%
That's cold.

00:24:49.117 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Although, elk,
and deer, and bears

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:53.682 align:middle line:90%
all survive the same cold.

00:24:53.682 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And squirrels.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:54.975 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Squirrels.

00:24:54.975 --> 00:24:56.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And things like that.

00:24:56.225 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: So sasquatch,
being more intelligent

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:84%
than those animals, has to have
figured out ways to survive it.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think they
probably-- if they're

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:84%
living at high
altitude, they probably

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
descend, like the
other game does.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And it would be very
difficult for them

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:18.270 align:middle line:84%
to move in 2 to 3 feet of snow,
let alone their juveniles.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I would think they
wouldn't want to do that.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So I would think they
move down in elevation.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.280 align:middle line:84%
But again, if they're
not merely physical,

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:90%
if they have more than--

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:84%
if they're multi-dimensional,
they could leave and go

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:33.640 align:middle line:90%
to someplace else--

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: --when
it's cold like this.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
polled 100 people,

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.045 align:middle line:84%
what percent would say
they believe in bigfoot?

00:25:42.045 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: That's
a great question.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I think more people believe
than we would give credit to.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But I would say probably
15% to 20% of the population

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.438 align:middle line:84%
believe to some degree that
bigfoot could be out there.

00:25:56.438 --> 00:25:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you convinced
beyond a shadow of a doubt--

00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: 100%.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that something's
going on out there?

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: 100%.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever it is.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:04.710 align:middle line:90%
What's your gut tell you?

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: My gut tells me that
there are far more of them than

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.190 align:middle line:90%
we realize, that--

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the country.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: All over the
country, and every state,

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:14.285 align:middle line:90%
and around the world.

00:26:14.285 --> 00:26:15.085 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Canada?

00:26:15.085 --> 00:26:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Canada, absolutely.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Even Mexico.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:22.750 align:middle line:84%
The only continent I've never
heard of sightings is Africa.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: But I believe
that they are real.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:90%
I believe that they--

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're getting this
in Russia and everything else?

00:26:30.745 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Russia, China,
Australia, Southeast Asia

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
all have a name and a tradition
of a hairy bipedal creature.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:44.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we don't
have one to look at?

00:26:44.135 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Well, do we?

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced that
we probably do.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:84%
We, being the authorities,
or our government

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.970 align:middle line:84%
probably has a body, maybe
even a live specimen.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:84%
There's stories after
the Mount St. Helens

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.930 align:middle line:84%
eruption of them gathering
bodies of sasquatch,

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:08.710 align:middle line:84%
piling them up, and even
having human sasquatch

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:84%
talking with each
other as though someone

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
had learned to speak sasquatch,
and was talking with them.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.200 align:middle line:90%
And eyewitnesses reporting this.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, take those for
what they're worth.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if those
are true stories or not.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:84%
But enough of those stories,
and you begin to wonder, OK,

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:90%
is it possible?

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything biblical about
bigfoot other than the Nephilim

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.130 align:middle line:90%
giants?

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: That's the
one biblical reference

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:84%
that people would
refer to is that they

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:45.020 align:middle line:84%
could be the product of men
and fallen angels reproducing.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what I think
about that, to be honest.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But you know, who's
an expert on bigfoot?

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I'm certainly not
an expert, so I would say,

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.440 align:middle line:90%
it's possible.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are
they in the woods?

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:84%
If they have any
intelligence, why haven't they

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.680 align:middle line:84%
developed to the
point where they've

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.528 align:middle line:84%
built houses, and
structures, and buildings?

00:28:03.528 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: It's a great question.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And I get asked
that question a lot.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:07.913 align:middle line:90%
Now, to me--

00:28:07.913 --> 00:28:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
like cave people.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: --that
question presupposes

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:84%
that building houses
and building structures

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.430 align:middle line:84%
is the equivalent
of intelligence.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have to build
houses because we

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.347 align:middle line:90%
would die without shelter.

00:28:22.347 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: We have to
wear thick clothing.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Sasquatch doesn't.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So if we did not need the
shelter and the clothing

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:90%
that we do, would we build it?

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Would we build it?

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:84%
So to me, the ability
to construct versus not

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:84%
does not necessarily
correlate intelligence.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they
are highly intelligent.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.760 align:middle line:84%
They don't need what we need
to survive in the woods.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody
ever found anything

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:56.220 align:middle line:84%
that would look like they built
a boat or anything like that?

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: No.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:01.790 align:middle line:84%
There have been many
structures, tipi structures,

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
nests that are fairly
elaborate with pine boughs

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and an entrance,
certainly caves.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.800 align:middle line:90%
But no, to my understanding--

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.287 align:middle line:84%
and I've talked to
hundreds of researchers--

00:29:18.287 --> 00:29:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe anything
like that has been found.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
bigfoot community like, Jim?

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: It's an
interesting community.

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:28.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a community
that I would say

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:33.630 align:middle line:84%
is divided between those who
would see sasquatch as an ape,

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:37.140 align:middle line:84%
or a descendant
of gigantopithecus

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:84%
versus those who would see
them more as a hominid,

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.360 align:middle line:90%
as a human hybrid.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.635 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:43.635 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: And we all attend
the same conferences.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.300 align:middle line:90%
We all give talks, et cetera.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But these two
groups don't agree.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And often it can be quite
a lot of territorialism

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:90%
within the community.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I think if everyone who
is a bigfoot researcher

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.760 align:middle line:84%
could share the
knowledge that we have,

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
we would be far further down
the road in our research

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.982 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, some people
have said that bigfoot merely

00:30:08.982 --> 00:30:11.880 align:middle line:84%
looks like it disappears
in the flash of an eye,

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.060 align:middle line:84%
almost like your situation,
where you, of course, turned

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:90%
your head, and it was gone.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.990 align:middle line:84%
But some people think
that the thing just

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:20.770 align:middle line:90%
has an ability to disappear.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:21.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I have two personal
friends and a secondhand report

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:84%
that I don't doubt who have
actually seen them disappear

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:33.550 align:middle line:90%
in front of their eyes.

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And I trust these
people implicitly.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:41.250 align:middle line:84%
They're good friends who I have
no reason to think would lie.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And they were watching them, and
they literally dematerialized

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:90%
in front of their eyes.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.507 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This would mean
that it could be dimensional.

00:30:48.507 --> 00:30:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: That's what
my assumption would be.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bizarre.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: The question is,
when they dematerialize

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:84%
or disappear, did
they go somewhere,

00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:00.393 align:middle line:84%
or did they just go invisible
to the eyes of that person?

00:31:00.393 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Meaning they're still there.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like they
cloaked themselves.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: But they cloaked.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:03.832 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:03.832 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about healings?

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any mystical
healing stories?

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: I do.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I have two stories, or
three now, actually,

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.410 align:middle line:84%
of people who
would say that they

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:18.120 align:middle line:90%
were healed by a sasquatch.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: That is
their conclusion.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: And healed of terminal
illnesses in some case,

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.210 align:middle line:90%
and stayed healed.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like something
caring, benevolent.

00:31:28.325 --> 00:31:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: It never came--

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that illness never came
back after that experience.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jack Cary
was a researcher,

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and he appeared on Gaia's
program "Open Minds"

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:40.860 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the possibility
that bigfoot had the ability

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.530 align:middle line:84%
to paralyze its victims,
sometimes humans.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: My
understanding is they have

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.460 align:middle line:90%
very--

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.280 align:middle line:84%
they're very capable in
terms of their telepathy

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and their extrasensory
awareness.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JACK CARY: Absolutely.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, we do have a lot
of what I consider

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:59.550 align:middle line:84%
circumstantial evidence
that these creatures are

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:05.370 align:middle line:84%
able to emit ELF wave
frequencies, extremely

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:09.120 align:middle line:84%
low frequencies, much
like an elephant would

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.530 align:middle line:90%
communicate long distance.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:12.990 align:middle line:84%
These creatures also
have that ability.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:84%
With these creatures,
it appears as

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.950 align:middle line:84%
though they're able to use this
ability to even paralyze prey.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:20.932 align:middle line:90%
Now, we've had many--

00:32:20.932 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Very interesting.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.390 align:middle line:84%
We've had many credible
hunters tell us, oh, I

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.347 align:middle line:90%
had this deer in my sights.

00:32:26.347 --> 00:32:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting ready
to pull the trigger.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.790 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I see
this-- this deer just freezes

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: It's just frozen
solid, and then the bushes

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.340 align:middle line:90%
begin to rustle.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And this big, giant, hairy
man stepped out of the bushes

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and picked this deer up,
put it over his shoulder,

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.592 align:middle line:90%
and walked off.

00:32:42.592 --> 00:32:43.800 align:middle line:90%
And they're white as a ghost.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.050 align:middle line:84%
They can't believe what
they've seen, you know?

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:46.967 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Of course.

00:32:46.967 --> 00:32:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And it's in
those different scenes,

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:84%
those different tales
that we're being

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.500 align:middle line:90%
told that we're suspecting.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, some-- we've also
had people tell us, well,

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.402 align:middle line:84%
they were also paralyzed by
one of them, some kind of--

00:32:58.402 --> 00:33:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Through these
same ELF frequencies.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: The creatures
approached--

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:05.160 align:middle line:84%
these creatures will do--
freeze them, approach them

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.740 align:middle line:84%
in a campsite, and
then just stroll off.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And has there been
any indication that there was

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.300 align:middle line:84%
ever harassment or violence
exhibited toward the human

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:20.010 align:middle line:84%
species by them, or are they
generally more living within

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:24.360 align:middle line:84%
whatever is needed for their own
survival in terms of working--

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:90%
consuming animals, for example?

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:26.668 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Oh, absolutely.

00:33:26.668 --> 00:33:28.693 align:middle line:84%
If they could be
left totally alone,

00:33:28.693 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:90%
that would be their preference.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.102 align:middle line:90%
That's why they are so elusive.

00:33:32.102 --> 00:33:32.935 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:33:32.935 --> 00:33:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They can hear
you from a mile away,

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.540 align:middle line:90%
smell you from two miles away--

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:36.905 align:middle line:90%


00:33:36.905 --> 00:33:38.760 align:middle line:84%
--see you from three,
you know what I mean?

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And a creature like
that, if it doesn't

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:44.212 align:middle line:84%
want to be found or seen, you're
not going to find it or see it.

00:33:44.212 --> 00:33:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: And that's smart.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.337 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for their own
survival, they certainly

00:33:47.337 --> 00:33:49.020 align:middle line:84%
understand man is an
aggressive species.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And yet they have
this human DNA.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So what we suspect is that this
group, this lineage of humanity

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:01.200 align:middle line:90%
has chosen this path.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.570 align:middle line:84%
They've chosen to
separate themselves

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.778 align:middle line:90%
from the technological world.

00:34:04.778 --> 00:34:06.237 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I
believe that is true.

00:34:06.237 --> 00:34:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They are living in
their own harmonious way

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.070 align:middle line:90%
with their existence.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody
reported, Jim,

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.909 align:middle line:84%
that they've found
remnants of where

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:18.630 align:middle line:84%
a bigfoot might be living,
a campfire, or anything

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.659 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:22.735 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Well, people have
found evidence of them--

00:34:22.735 --> 00:34:25.820 align:middle line:84%
what they think is
sasquatch living in caves,

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.210 align:middle line:84%
having brought in
brush and things

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:32.300 align:middle line:84%
to sleep on to make
it more comfortable.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been to a cave that had
green leaves that did not--

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:40.070 align:middle line:84%
were not from that cave,
that were brought in,

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and an impression
of a large body

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.634 align:middle line:84%
having been lying
on those leaves.

00:34:45.634 --> 00:34:47.370 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
something else,

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:49.739 align:middle line:84%
but those leaves were
brought in by something.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So yes, people have
found evidence.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.630 align:middle line:84%
To my knowledge, no
one's found any bones.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Things like that.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, we
don't find many deer bones

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.880 align:middle line:90%
in the woods.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.255 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: No.

00:35:02.255 --> 00:35:03.206 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or bear, or
anything like that either.

00:35:03.206 --> 00:35:04.789 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: And I've
asked hunters who've

00:35:04.789 --> 00:35:07.730 align:middle line:84%
hunted their entire lives, and
I've hunted most of my life,

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:11.690 align:middle line:84%
how many large predator
carcasses they've found.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've only met
one who's found

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:18.290 align:middle line:84%
a bear or a mountain lion that
was already dead in the woods.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.437 align:middle line:90%
Nature's very efficient.

00:35:19.437 --> 00:35:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.228 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Even for a large
creature like a bear.

00:35:22.228 --> 00:35:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there any UFO
reports near bigfoot sightings?

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Yes.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to be a
correlation between those two,

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.410 align:middle line:90%
at least circumstantially.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So what's more common is
bigfoot being accompanied

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:40.700 align:middle line:84%
by orbs in the woods,
lights that don't

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.830 align:middle line:90%
have any origin from outside.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:45.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not a human source.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:90%
That's fairly common.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But having a UFO
sighting and a bigfoot

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:54.290 align:middle line:84%
sighting very close to one
another in timing and proximity

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.560 align:middle line:90%
is not uncommon.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And so you could draw the
conclusion that maybe they

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.990 align:middle line:84%
came out of that
UFO, or dropped off,

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:04.760 align:middle line:90%
or something to that effect.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does your
family say about this?

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I think most of
my family think I'm crazy.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I think they humor me.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:19.458 align:middle line:84%
But none of them have been
out researching with me.

00:36:19.458 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or have seen anything.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.208 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Or have
seen anything, no.

00:36:22.208 --> 00:36:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would guess
that if one has a sighting,

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.870 align:middle line:84%
it changes your perspective
pretty darn fast.

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: It does.

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And it tends to change
some people's lives,

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to the point
where they never either--

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.220 align:middle line:84%
hunters who have
encountered them never

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:40.155 align:middle line:84%
go hunting again, because
it frightened them so badly.

00:36:40.155 --> 00:36:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're scared of them.

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Or people who've seen
them whenever they go out,

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:49.760 align:middle line:84%
they look at the woods
in a different way.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.340 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for different
things than they used to.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've heard stories
where families of bigfoot

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:57.890 align:middle line:84%
would throw rocks at a
house and stuff like that,

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:59.670 align:middle line:84%
almost like they're
mischief makers.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I've had them
throw things at me

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.500 align:middle line:84%
more than once in
the woods at night.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And there could be
no other explanation

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:84%
because nothing else
has a thumb to throw.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've had-- and
when they throw,

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.030 align:middle line:90%
they throw extremely hard.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I've never
been hit, but I've

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:22.425 align:middle line:84%
had them hit trees very close to
me with an extremely loud crack

00:37:22.425 --> 00:37:23.225 align:middle line:90%
noise.

00:37:23.225 --> 00:37:24.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:37:24.025 --> 00:37:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: And had they
hit me in the head,

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.210 align:middle line:90%
I would probably be dead.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's kind of scary.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: It is.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:34.580 align:middle line:84%
But I'm realizing that because
they have the potential

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to do harm and don't, that
I'm not so afraid when I go

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.530 align:middle line:90%
in the woods as I used to be.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's times when
you have moments of fear.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:51.122 align:middle line:84%
But I'm learning to trust them
and to trust their trust of us,

00:37:51.122 --> 00:37:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I guess, is the
best way to put it.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got some
sounds at the museum

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.410 align:middle line:90%
of what bigfoot might be.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.750 align:middle line:84%
What does that
sound like to you?

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Well,
they're so diverse.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a roar?

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: It sounds
like people many times.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.020 align:middle line:84%
When they speak, it sounds
like people talking.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.290 align:middle line:90%
It's an actual language.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard that
numerous times.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:84%
You can pick out words
that you can't under--

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So not like a dog
bark or anything like that?

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I've heard them
make barks like a dog.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.300 align:middle line:90%
I've heard them howl.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:25.923 align:middle line:84%
I've heard them laugh like
we laugh, strange laughter.

00:38:25.923 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a hyena?

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: No, like a human
laugh, but in a bizarre way.

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And so they yell,
like humans do.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:41.460 align:middle line:84%
But the volume they can
create is phenomenal.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a human could never
create that kind of volume

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.338 align:middle line:84%
and be heard as far
away as a sasquatch.

00:38:46.338 --> 00:38:47.138 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:47.138 --> 00:38:50.460 align:middle line:84%
It could go for what, hundreds
and thousands of feet?

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: A mile, 2
miles, I would say.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.395 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Sometimes, yeah.

00:38:54.395 --> 00:38:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about singing?

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody heard
them in unison?

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: People have heard
singing in the woods.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether it was a
sasquatch or not, I don't know.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But I've heard more than
one story of someone

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:09.590 align:middle line:84%
reporting a voice
singing in the--

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:14.630 align:middle line:84%
words they couldn't understand,
but definitely singing.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.730 align:middle line:90%
I've had them whistle.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I've been in the woods late
at night, whistling a tune,

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and the same tune comes
back to me out of the woods.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like an echo.

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Like an echo,
but it was not an echo.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.738 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It wasn't you.

00:39:27.738 --> 00:39:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: It was something
whistled that tune back to me.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been scared out there--

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Many times.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --for your own safety?

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Yes.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: I'm usually
armed when I go out.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:41.450 align:middle line:90%
My hope is that--

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and I've never pulled my
gun out of the holster once.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:50.200 align:middle line:84%
My hope is that they know my
intent is not to do them harm.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's as much
to protect myself

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:55.210 align:middle line:84%
from mountain lions
and other things

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.790 align:middle line:90%
as it would be from a sasquatch.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I think if a sasquatch was
intent on doing me harm,

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.817 align:middle line:84%
I would not have time to
defend myself, really.

00:40:03.817 --> 00:40:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And you know, thank god there
aren't circuses anymore.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Right.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I
really think they would

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.940 align:middle line:90%
try to go after finding one.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Oh, if
they could find one.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.630 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I
don't know if you

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:19.510 align:middle line:84%
heard the story about the
representative in Oklahoma

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:21.530 align:middle line:84%
who wants to have a
bigfoot hunting season.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh god.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: Or a bigfoot
trapping season.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.360 align:middle line:90%
But I'm convinced--

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Horrible!

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: It is.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:30.040 align:middle line:84%
But I'm convinced that they
will never be able to trap them

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.390 align:middle line:90%
because they're too large.

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:32.770 align:middle line:90%
They're too powerful.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:36.045 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't design a trap that
they could not get out of.

00:40:36.045 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
been out camping.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: I have.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:39.667 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes you're
scared, but have you

00:40:39.667 --> 00:40:41.650 align:middle line:84%
ever had anything happen
where they rattle you

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:42.290 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Yeah.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I've been in a tent with another
researcher and had them--

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:49.330 align:middle line:90%
it's funny.

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:52.390 align:middle line:84%
When you're out
squatching, as we call it,

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.150 align:middle line:84%
you generally don't want to have
any part of your body touching

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.040 align:middle line:84%
the edge of the tent
because that's what

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.490 align:middle line:90%
they're going to mess with.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: Touch whatever.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.228 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
want them to grab you.

00:41:02.228 --> 00:41:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: My bed was touching
the edge of the tent

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.490 align:middle line:90%
in this particular situation.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And about 3:00 in the morning
something grabbed my bed

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.990 align:middle line:90%
and shook it from the outside.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting up at the time
in my sleeping bag, listening,

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.365 align:middle line:84%
because I thought I heard
something scratching

00:41:20.365 --> 00:41:21.490 align:middle line:90%
on the outside of the tent.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting like this,
and then it grabbed--

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.070 align:middle line:84%
something grabbed
my bed and shook it.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And I yelled and
woke my tentmate up.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MYERS: But that
same weekend I had

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:35.930 align:middle line:84%
something pushing on
the outside of the tent,

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:39.945 align:middle line:84%
almost like they were trying
to figure out what was inside.

00:41:39.945 --> 00:41:41.945 align:middle line:84%
If I'd had more guts, I
would have put my hand--

00:41:41.945 --> 00:41:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pushed back.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.925 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: --and pushed back.

00:41:43.925 --> 00:41:45.420 align:middle line:84%
But I was too
afraid at the time.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:49.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do people find
your museum in Bailey, Colorado?

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.250 align:middle line:10%
>>MYERS: We're actually
right on Highway 285.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.890 align:middle line:10%
It goes right through Bailey.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:58.580 align:middle line:10%
It's the main thoroughfare,
other than highway 70.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And we have signs on the highway
that say, Bigfoot Museum.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Jim, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MYERS: You're welcome.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These bigfoot
stories are fantastic.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.660 align:middle line:10%
I know that if I were
out camping one day

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.960 align:middle line:10%
and saw a bigfoot, I
would become a believer

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.640 align:middle line:10%
for the rest of my life.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:24.000 align:middle line:90%
