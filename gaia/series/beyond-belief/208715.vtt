00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: How many
times have you died?

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DANNION BRINKLEY:
I've died so many times,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.187 align:middle line:90%
it's like a comedy routine.

00:00:13.187 --> 00:00:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You keep bouncing back.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.810 align:middle line:90%
You're like a rubber ball.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.268 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: We're
living in a world

00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:84%
where everybody's scared
to death of death.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Death as you'd think it
happens does not happen.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Over there, you're not
separate from anything.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:90%
You are it.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:84%
You will see your whole life
pass before you in a 360 degree

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
panorama, and then you will
literally become every person

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
that you ever
encounter, and you'll

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:84%
feel the direct results of
your interaction between you

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.390 align:middle line:90%
and that person.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: You will take
your last breath here.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And the more you're
prepared for it

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
and the more you understand
it and the better that you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:84%
understand it, the more
living you're going to do.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:10%
Our friend Dannion
Brinkley with us.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:10%
He has taught millions
not to fear death.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:10%
Dannion, of course, hasn't been
on the program in five years.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know you've
died several times

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:90%
since that five-year period.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.510 align:middle line:90%
What's been going on with you?

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.360 align:middle line:10%
>>BRINKLEY: Well, George,
you know I've been around--

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:10%
I've died so many times,
it's like a comedy routine.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My God.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: But in
this last experience,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I had an aneurysm
under my aortic valve.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.185 align:middle line:84%
I went to a blood
pressure of 12.

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:23.985 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 12?

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Mm-hmm.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:10%
And I went into
cardiac arrest, and I

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.830 align:middle line:10%
had to have open heart surgery.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.570 align:middle line:10%
When the surgeon got in there
to do the open heart surgery,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.700 align:middle line:10%
she said the amount of scar
tissue that I had inside

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.920 align:middle line:10%
my body from being
struck by lightning

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:10%
45 years ago was so much
damaged that she came out

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:10%
of the surgery and told
my brother and my sister

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:10%
and Katherine that I probably
wouldn't make it 10 days.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Well, I
only made it five days.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
But the point of this
story is now here

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.720 align:middle line:90%
is four of these experiences.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I started back when
"Saved by the Light" came.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:90%
I wrote it in 1993.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.690 align:middle line:90%
It was published in '94.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.539 align:middle line:84%
And I told about being
struck by lightning in 1975.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the story of being
back on "Beyond Belief"

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is that opportunity to bring
that information forward.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.100 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a
world where everybody's

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:90%
scared to death of death.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 1975,
George, when I finally

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:84%
took two years to learn
to walk and feed myself

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
after the first
near-death experience

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and what became the boxes
of knowledge, they were 12.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And now we're in the
12th and final box.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So based on all those
things that occurred,

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
the time we are right now is
so critical and so important

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
that we have to pay really close
attention to what people learn

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:90%
from the near-death experience.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
times have you died?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Three.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I've had four
near-death experiences.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
One, struck by
lightning, I was dead.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:10%
Then I don't count coming
out of open heart surgery

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:10%
into the intensive care unit
because I have no memory.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I have memory of the fourth
near-death experience,

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.560 align:middle line:84%
the same panoramic
life review and what

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:90%
they're showing me again.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell people,
never want to know everything.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:10%
Because if you want to know
everything, and you go heart--

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:10%
that's my second
open heart surgery--

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:10%
and you see the vast
wonderment of who

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:10%
we are as spiritual beings and
reinforce so many things that

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:10%
getting older I've
learned to understand,

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:10%
it becomes just so important
that we take a good look

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:10%
at how critical this is
and what Box 12 represented

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:10%
and what it really means
to-- like a call to action.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
It's why I really wanted to
get on this show, George.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.020 align:middle line:84%
We need to have a call to
action about the value we

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:84%
place upon this thing
that we call death.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
stay so upbeat, so

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:84%
positive with all these
experiences that happened?

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Well, everybody
has a purpose, George.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm lucky enough to know mine.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I learned it in
1975 as a jackass to see

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:90%
that I am a spiritual being.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And in a succession
of events that

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
allows me to have a conscious
voice to say, hey, look,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.470 align:middle line:84%
everything that you're
afraid of, pain, suffering,

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:84%
losing everything,
being dead, I've

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:90%
already been through all that.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I've been through
it so often that I

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
chose to be at the bedside of
people going from this world

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:84%
to the next, and to help
develop and create programming

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
that now the VA has the No
Vet Die Alone program, which

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
came from the Twilight
Brigade, which

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:90%
is what you help me build.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And now by creating
these programmings

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:84%
and be able to bring
this knowledge forward,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I look at palliative
and end-of-life care

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and knowing in
this next pandemic,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have to be home.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So if we're in Box 12,
which I believe that we are,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and being there,
the critical things

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
that people have to decide
is take a good look at death.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
George, in life, there

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.427 align:middle line:90%
are things that are certain--

00:05:06.427 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's one of them.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Certainty.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you breathing,
you're leaving.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: And it's
guaranteed and inevitable,

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and I've taken that
on myself to do.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:84%
I've always talked about
that the battle for the souls

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.762 align:middle line:84%
of humankind would be
fought in the health care--

00:05:22.762 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:84%
you've been listening
to that for 18 years--

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and that we are there
and that this program

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
would come into play, which
is what we're watching now,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:84%
called the lockdown or the
pandemic, would come into play.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And that when you think about
the battle for the souls

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:84%
of humankind being
fought in health care,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and you look at everything
that's distracting us,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
but it gets back down to health
care, then I'm pretty sure

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:90%
we're there.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:84%
The thing that troubles me
is I have seen and watched

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:90%
this thing unfold for 45 years.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've been reinforced
bunches of times,

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
both being a hospice
volunteer for 43 years

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and being with 2,013 people
going from this world

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.888 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

00:06:05.888 --> 00:06:07.680 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have a
problem about whether I'm

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:90%
an expert in death and dying.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:10%
But if we don't take
a conscious look at it

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.790 align:middle line:10%
and we keep driven
to be afraid, then we

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:10%
lose a certain connection
to our spiritual selves.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's got
to be an important issue.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matías De Stefano
talked about his remembrances

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.688 align:middle line:90%
of past lives, much like you.

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MATÍAS DE STEFANO: Unity is
not something that we are going

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to live as a real
thing in this planet.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:84%
The reality of this
universe is that there

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.490 align:middle line:84%
is no time and no space
because everything is just one.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
There is no split
in times, there's

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:84%
no split in perspectives,
there's no split in space.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's why unity is
the only state where

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:84%
you could feel everything,
where you could see everything,

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:90%
where you could be anywhere.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Sirius for us was the
spot where we could

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:90%
learn how to go back to unity.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:90%
We used to call Sirius, In-Na.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:10%
That's the name we had
for the two stars--

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.090 align:middle line:10%
the bigger one, In,
and the small one, Na.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:10%
In-Na.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:10%
We were called the In-Na people.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And the In-Na people
has this story.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.150 align:middle line:84%
At the first beginning,
there was nothing.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:90%
There was a void.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And from that void, there was
a breath, a breathing that

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.850 align:middle line:90%
starts to create every reality.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
By that breathing, a door
was opened in the universe,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:90%
the door of the self.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And the self went through
every time and every space.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
We call that the M, the
portal, the H, the time,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:90%
and the S, the space.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So the name for the
universe for us was Mahas.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Mahas was the creation,
was the consciousness going

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:84%
from this unity
towards everything,

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:90%
towards every dimension.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we realized
that, where does it go

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:90%
and what is the limit of that?

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
But we realized that
it was limitless.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.420 align:middle line:90%
There was no end.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:90%
There was no purpose.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:84%
So the only purpose
that we had was

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand
every space, to understand

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
every time, and then bring them
all to the portal to the self

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.943 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:08:42.943 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dannion, do all
of you who go through those

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.738 align:middle line:84%
experiences all have the same
kind of thing happen to them?

00:08:47.738 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: The
near-death experience

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.420 align:middle line:84%
has a certain basic
structure to it.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm listening
to him, this

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.413 align:middle line:84%
is a person trying
to explain something

00:08:55.413 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that I know what he's
trying to explain.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've been there.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And he's trying to
find a language.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:84%
When you look at this, George,
and you are brave enough

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.550 align:middle line:84%
to step up and look at it,
the inevitability of it,

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:84%
then there are basic
markers that exist in it.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:84%
You will see your
life pass before you.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
The near-death experience
has created a point

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:84%
where it's worth studying,
observing, and looking at it

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:84%
because we are in the place
where transition is inevitable.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Half of the population
of America--

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.740 align:middle line:90%
some 74 million people--

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:84%
are in an age group called baby
boomers and a little older.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:90%
So this issue is theirs.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: And when you look
at the demographic of men

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and women in their
50s, women are

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:84%
going to be the
primary caregivers

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:90%
for one or more parents.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Primary caregiver.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: And
then they're looking

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:84%
at how their life is
shifting and changing also

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.980 align:middle line:90%
when you hit the mid 50s.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:90%
We know.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.020 align:middle line:90%
We understand.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:84%
We can look back we
can look there and see.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
This becomes such a
critical point, George,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
in where evolution
of the human being

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:84%
is in a situation that,
to me, is frightful.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:84%
But you ask me why I'm always
upbeat in the most horrible

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:90%
situations and--

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anybody as upbeat

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:84%
as you are during some
really tough, tough times.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: I know
I'm a spiritual being.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And I know that everybody
that's watching and listening

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.140 align:middle line:90%
are a spiritual being too.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.350 align:middle line:84%
I know you were chosen
to come to this place

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:90%
and you chose to come here.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And to get here is
getting into the Olympics.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like getting in
on the Olympic team.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:84%
You have made it
to the opportunity

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
to in this dimension that
we call human experience.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
You have made it to
this opportunity to,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I always say,
practicing being a God.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if everybody
wants to know

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.550 align:middle line:84%
their life purpose, George,
it's to practice being a God.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
that, think of this.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:84%
If you take a piece of
paper and write down

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:84%
everything you hope God is,
loving, caring, compassionate,

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:84%
all-knowing, protective,
safety, never alone,

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:84%
how many times per
day in your life

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:84%
do you get a chance to be
every one of those things?

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.060 align:middle line:84%
The answer is all
day, every day.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I know that's the
meaning of life.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So I have to struggle with
the fact that knowing you

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:84%
don't die, knowing I
didn't go to hell--

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and I've been over
there four times.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:90%
I've never been to hell yet.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: So I know I'm
not going to go to hell.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: I know
I'm not going to die.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
So I get excited about
living this opportunity,

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:84%
to be able to make a difference
in the lives of people that

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.220 align:middle line:84%
are frightened about
death, and have

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:84%
a sense of confidence
and security

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
they can trust what
I'm telling them.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing what this
young man is doing.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:84%
He's explaining the heritage
and history of his people

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:90%
in phraseology.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't see it
like that, George.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.780 align:middle line:84%
We're structured as
human spiritual beings.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.830 align:middle line:90%
There is a structure.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.530 align:middle line:84%
You have a life review,
the great book of judgment.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:84%
You will see your whole
life pass before you

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:90%
in a 360 degree panorama.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:84%
You will watch it from a
second-person point of view

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:84%
as if you were your
own best friend.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you will literally
become every person

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:90%
that you ever encounter.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And you'll feel to direct
results of your interaction

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:90%
between you and that person.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:84%
When you put that
into context, which

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.950 align:middle line:84%
is a basic tenet of the
near-death experience,

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.870 align:middle line:84%
if that doesn't
change your life,

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.190 align:middle line:90%
there's something really wrong.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing will.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Nothing will.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Something's wrong.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.813 align:middle line:84%
And I've been through
four of those puppies.

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
talked about Box 12.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.655 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:12:30.655 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got an
excerpt from your book

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:90%
that you want to read us.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Well, it's
"Saved by the Light."

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And Box 12 was when I
had this vision in 1975

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and struck by
lightning, George, it

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:84%
came down to what I call
the Boxes of Knowledge,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:84%
where these beings showed
me this information.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:84%
When I saw this
information, I thought

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.570 align:middle line:84%
it was a timeline being
created for me that I

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:84%
had to reach certain points
into succeeding in what I had

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:90%
to reduce in the fear of death.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:90%
I never saw it as prophecy.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: I never
saw any of that.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:84%
It was Raymond who started
that rage because, in 1976--

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Moody?

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: --I
told him that the--

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Raymond Moody?

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Dr. Raymond Moody.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I told him that the Soviet
Union would collapse,

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I told him about Chernobyl, that
this would happen in the '80s,

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.603 align:middle line:90%
and I called it Wormwood.

00:13:19.603 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know the
Ukrainian word--

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
what Chernobyl means.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.365 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: --in Ukrainian.

00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So when that all happened,
as those two things happened,

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Raymond began to
spread the word.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of the best people
for after-death experiences

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
in terms of knowledge
is Dr. Raymond Moody.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Raymond was a philosopher.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
brilliant minds--

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.105 align:middle line:84%
all great psychiatrists
and great philosophers

00:13:43.105 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:90%
are a little crazy.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of Raymond's
best friends

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
have been dead for 3,000
years, Socrates, Plato.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And his best friend
was Dr. John Dees,

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
but he died sometime
in the 1500s.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But I met Raymond
in 1976, George.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And he asked the
right questions.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Because when I had
this experience,

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.270 align:middle line:90%
I never heard of it.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:10%
And he hadn't even
published "Life after Life."

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And I met him at the University
of Georgia Medical Center,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.050 align:middle line:90%
and I went to a program.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And we met and started talking.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.317 align:middle line:84%
And he asked the right
kind of questions.

00:14:18.317 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: And so Raymond's
never had this experience.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:84%
He's a philosopher with
a forensic psychiatrist

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:90%
mind and brilliant.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And so when he
brought this forth,

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:84%
then when I would
talk to him, I was

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:84%
describing the things
that were happening

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:90%
and trying to find language.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to really work hard in
dictionaries and thesauruses,

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
George, to find words that take
an emotion or an ethereal--

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:84%
over there, you're not
separate from anything.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.990 align:middle line:90%
You are not separate.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:90%
You are it.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to come
back into this domain.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And I have to use
English to find

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.190 align:middle line:84%
words that express that like
what this young man was doing.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Dr.
Moody, back in 1975

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.980 align:middle line:84%
after one of your first NDEs,
was on the Gaia series "Legacy"

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:84%
recently and talked
about an experiment

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.910 align:middle line:84%
he conducted to try to
contact the other side.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RAYMOND MOODY:
Basically, this was

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:90%
the technique I figured out.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I asked them, each
one, I said, I

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:84%
want you to choose one
person who died that you

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:90%
would like to see again.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
come to my place,

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.080 align:middle line:84%
10 o'clock in the morning-- this
would be one on one all day.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I would spend an hour or two
with them just basically saying

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:84%
like, tell me about
this person who died.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:90%
What was this person like?

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Then you just let them
talk as long as they will,

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.480 align:middle line:84%
then you come back with a
slightly less open-ended

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
What are some of your
fondest memories?

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Let them talk until they will.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Then, what are some of the
hang-ups in their relationship

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:90%
that you regret?

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is just to talk
about the person who died.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I would escort
them into this little room

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and I would put
them in the chair.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
just get very relaxed

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and let all these feelings and
thoughts go through your mind

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.460 align:middle line:90%
and gaze away into the mirror.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, I'm
going to leave you here

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:84%
about an hour, hour and a
half-- say it very casually.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And if when I come back,
something is going on,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:84%
you just shoo me away and
come out whenever you want.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:10%
And then when I would
go in and retrieve them,

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.570 align:middle line:10%
then I would spend an
hour or two or more

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:10%
afterward just processing
what they went through.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And I set this
up, and my thought

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.870 align:middle line:84%
was, well, if I do 50
of these, I'll probably

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:84%
get five or so cases and I
can write a little paper.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And I felt certainly that since
these were my psychologist

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
students or my
medical colleagues who

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:84%
had studied about the mind
that if anything happened,

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.599 align:middle line:84%
they would say something
like, oh, yeah.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:90%
I saw this image.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:90%
It looked like my grandma.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:84%
But was it real
or was it a figm--

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.640 align:middle line:90%
That was what I expected.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
Imagine my surprise when the
first person I put in there--

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:84%
44 years old, a very
distinguished alcohol rehab

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:84%
counselor, just a
very grounded person--

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:84%
came and prepared all day
to see her husband who

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:90%
had died two years before.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.310 align:middle line:10%
But she came out of there
astonished and she said, well,

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:middle line:10%
I didn't see my husband, but
my father showed up and stepped

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:10%
out of the mirror.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:84%
She said the first thing
she saw was, like, in there.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But then her father came forward
and emerged from the mirror.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Randy was this lady's name.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, you--

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.700 align:middle line:84%
assuming that it would be
dreamlike, but I was astonished

00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.840 align:middle line:90%
she said, no.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:90%
This was really my father.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was the reaction
I got from everybody

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I took through there, that
no matter how psychologically

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.952 align:middle line:84%
informed they were, they
took this to be a real event.

00:18:12.952 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't come any
better than Dr. Raymond Moody.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Oh, George.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:90%
And watch this.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: I was
present when this program

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.570 align:middle line:90%
was being developed.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:84%
This is before "Saved by the
Light" or before any of that.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.083 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Raymond
and I were working

00:18:26.083 --> 00:18:31.268 align:middle line:84%
on projects and programs,
and we did Joan Rivers.

00:18:31.268 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
We went on the show
with Joan Rivers.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:90%
And you know how I am, George.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.130 align:middle line:90%
You know I'm pushy.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:35.930 align:middle line:90%
So as she was--

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: (SARCASTICALLY) You?

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: She
was placating us.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And Raymond and I were
working this program.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:84%
We called it the "Dr. John Dees
Memorial Center of the Mind."

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: And I
remember these people.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, Joan Rivers--

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:90%
I told her.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, why don't you
just come to Anniston, Alabama

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:90%
and go through the program?

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we had four or
five different steps.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.690 align:middle line:90%
She came down and filmed it.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:84%
She saw her husband Edgar,
but she went to Melissa.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.860 align:middle line:84%
She went to her daughter
from Anniston, Alabama

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:90%
to California.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:84%
She described exactly
what she was doing.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
She said she was
taking a shower and she

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:84%
talked about what was
laid out on the bed

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:90%
that she was going to put out.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And Joan described it in detail.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
let's call her.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So you get on the phone
and she calls Melissa, what

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.253 align:middle line:90%
were you doing 20 minutes ago?

00:19:26.253 --> 00:19:27.170 align:middle line:90%
I was taking a shower.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.295 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to wear?

00:19:28.295 --> 00:19:29.418 align:middle line:90%
They describe in detail--

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly what she said.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.668 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: And the two
girls go back and forth

00:19:32.668 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:90%
in the conversation.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's on YouTube.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can look
it up on YouTube.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:90%
That's like '91.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.182 align:middle line:90%
'90, '91.

00:19:39.182 --> 00:19:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you put in just
"Joan Rivers," whatever?

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.182 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: "Joan
Rivers, Dannion Brinkley,

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Raymond Moody," you'd find it.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:49.880 align:middle line:10%
But so the point of where
we are now in our lives

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:10%
is we have to move past
being afraid of being

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:10%
spiritual human beings and
look at a finite position that

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.790 align:middle line:10%
comes based on the allotted
time we have to be here

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:10%
and what we've accomplished.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:84%
When you die with
people, George,

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.560 align:middle line:84%
you realize that they have
to need a sense of wholeness.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:84%
They have to know
their life had value.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And they have to have a
technique by which you

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:84%
interact with them so that you
help facilitate that happening.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Box 12,
tell us about that.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And you have an
excerpt from your book.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you go
back to 1975 knowing

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:84%
that I've been at
this for 45 years,

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not new to the
death business.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was a series
of Boxes of Knowledge

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that that's what I call them,
that these beings had each

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:90%
transmitted to me.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
We're now in the
final box, Box 12.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Each of the 12 beings
gave me a box of knowledge

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:90%
and I stayed with me.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:50.422 align:middle line:84%
And when we saw about Raymond, I
told him in '76 that the Soviet

00:20:50.422 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Union would collapse
and then there

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.490 align:middle line:84%
would be a nuclear accident,
there would be one.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there would be another
one even worse, and then

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Fukushima.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And then there would be
another one even worse.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, when all those
things happened,

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:84%
it started Raymond to thinking
and he started telling this.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, I think we're in Box 12.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.395 align:middle line:84%
And there's a good part to it
and a bad part, but I'll just--

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
wrote this when?

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: I wrote this in
1993 using the same language

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote it down
in the notebooks

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.710 align:middle line:90%
when me and Paul Perry sat down.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
"Before the turn of
the century--" and this

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.210 align:middle line:84%
is all about computer
chips and technology.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Microsoft, Oracle,
all these software programs.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.302 align:middle line:84%
"One person will become
one of the richest,

00:21:33.302 --> 00:21:35.260 align:middle line:84%
so rich he had a stranglehold
on the economy--"

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:90%
that would be software.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.580 align:middle line:84%
"Still the world welcomed
him and the chip design that

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:90%
put the world on an even keel.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And what it would do was
it would put information

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:84%
of all your medical
records in this technology

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.330 align:middle line:90%
and it would go into your body.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:84%
A government agency wanted
to know something about you,

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:84%
they could just scan the chip--"
which is where we are now.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
"There was an even more
sinister side to this chip.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.990 align:middle line:84%
A person's lifetime could be
limited by programming the chip

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.780 align:middle line:84%
to dissolve or kill them
with a virtual substance.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Lifetimes could be
controlled like this

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to avoid the cost of growing
old placed on the government.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:84%
It was a means to eliminate
people with chronic illness

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and put a drain on
the medical system."

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: That was 1975.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.840 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Wait, wait.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:84%
It's exciting times,
George, for me.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:90%
The end of the--

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not for everybody.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Well, but
the end of the era.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:84%
The end of the era and the
shift in consciousness.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.880 align:middle line:84%
There was going to be a
shift in consciousness.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:84%
People will look at
death as a part of life

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and start to live
that life that way.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is you become
compassionate and caring.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And the things that you place
value on changes and shifts.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Because once you get comfortable
with not being afraid,

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.030 align:middle line:84%
once you get
comfortable, you open

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.450 align:middle line:84%
yourself up to such
enormous potential in a time

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:90%
to blossom or to be controlled.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just had a key
word there and phrase, "once we

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:90%
get comfortable."

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.758 align:middle line:84%
How many people are
scared of dying?

00:23:07.758 --> 00:23:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Everybody's
scared to death of death.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.008 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody wants to die.

00:23:11.008 --> 00:23:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Well, it's because
of this reason, George--

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.640 align:middle line:90%
getting there.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:84%
What you watch someone
you love go through

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:84%
with the advancements
of medical treatments,

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.340 align:middle line:84%
you face the fear of
death, not death itself.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It is the fear of
watching people slowly

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:84%
die because the
medical profession can

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.590 align:middle line:90%
keep you alive longer.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to
go before their time

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
because you breathe the
X amount of breaths.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But by not being afraid of
it, you reduce your own fear.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.343 align:middle line:84%
I have already been
through all the pain

00:23:44.343 --> 00:23:45.760 align:middle line:84%
that a human being
can go through.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You sure have.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: There
ain't no question.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.622 align:middle line:90%
And I've been through it.

00:23:48.622 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've lost everything in
medical and all that stuff.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.350 align:middle line:84%
But I get up every
day and so thankful

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:90%
that I am a spiritual being--

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You keep bouncing back.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.010 align:middle line:84%
You're like a rubber
ball, for crying out loud.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: But you know what?

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I think I do this,
George, because, watch.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:84%
If I have to symbolize that
there is no such thing as death

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.880 align:middle line:84%
as it's described to you, that
death as you think it happens

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:90%
does not happen.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And then listen to my
way of looking at it

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:90%
and see if it benefits you.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from going
through this experience four

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.420 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.030 align:middle line:84%
It's caused from
having this experience

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and spending 43 years as
a hospice volunteer, 37

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.397 align:middle line:84%
years in the VA, more than
34,000 hours at the bedside.

00:24:31.397 --> 00:24:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And thank you
for that, by the way.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: But, you
know, Semper Fidelis.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Navy
one day a month.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:84%
My check said
Department of the Navy.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, I was
in the Marine Corps.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you were.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: And your
check said the same thing.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.280 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Because without you,
George, and without Art

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and without Premiere,
the voice that we

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.940 align:middle line:90%
have built over 25 years--

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and as strong as it is and
me watching the response that

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.180 align:middle line:90%
comes back from it--

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.460 align:middle line:84%
we're doing
enormously good work.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And as military guys,
our Semper Fidelis,

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:84%
which means ever
faithful, we deserve

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:90%
to pat ourselves on the back.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a Gaia show,
"The Teachings of Ram Dass,"

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and he speaks about death
in a very similar way.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RAM DASS: A part of the
work is developing the ability

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:84%
to be with somebody that's
dying or be dying yourself

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and stay very clear
and very present.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Because those that are
from religions that

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:90%
focus on the moment of death--

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:84%
which is most of
the religions that

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.740 align:middle line:84%
have reincarnation
in them-- see life

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.960 align:middle line:84%
as a preparation for
the moment of death.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.130 align:middle line:90%
They see that.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And they see, as Don
Juan says, that you keep

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:90%
death over your left shoulder.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.060 align:middle line:84%
You live each moment as
if it's your last moment.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Not in a kind of macabre,
horrible, negative way,

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.230 align:middle line:84%
but in a way in
which each moment is

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:84%
the one where if it's
to be your death moment,

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.280 align:middle line:90%
it's, ah, here I am.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Very clear.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm dying.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Now the body is dropping away.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.598 align:middle line:84%
Like the Tibetans
in describing--

00:26:09.598 --> 00:26:11.140 align:middle line:84%
in the Tibetan Book
of the Dead, they

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.820 align:middle line:90%
describe the dying moments.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about the
Earth element leaves,

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:90%
and you feel heaviness.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.880 align:middle line:84%
The water element
leaves, you feel dryness.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:84%
The fire element leaves,
you feel coldness.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:84%
The air element
leaves, your out breath

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.440 align:middle line:90%
is not followed by an in breath.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.810 align:middle line:10%
What follows after
the incarnation

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:10%
is what's created
by the attachments

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.632 align:middle line:10%
of the moment of death.

00:26:35.632 --> 00:26:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So that those beings
that are going

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.310 align:middle line:84%
to go into the white
light are about 3/4

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:84%
of the way turned around
before the moment of death.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:45.250 align:middle line:84%
They're already right
here with all of it,

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:90%
even before they die.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So that a lot of the work
you're doing in a lifetime

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.850 align:middle line:84%
is the preparation for
the moment of death.

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And keeping death present
enriches the moment of life.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you died,
Dannion, several times,

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:84%
did you see lights and
strange things too?

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.320 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's always
been a system.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them had a similar
structure except the third one.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:12.070 align:middle line:84%
The 1997 brain
surgery was different.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered another
dimension of reality.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And I never knew about ghosts,
George, or reincarnation.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.860 align:middle line:84%
When people ask me
about reincarnation,

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:25.403 align:middle line:84%
I have no way to relate to in
my experiences to past lives.

00:27:25.403 --> 00:27:26.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a way to do it.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So you don't ever hear me
talk about it because I'm not

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
stuff that I don't

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:90%
know what I'm talking about.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you haven't
gone through hypnotherapy

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.010 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:35.052 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: None of that.

00:27:35.052 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So there is a structure
that you pass--

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:84%
there is a meadow or a
veil or a tunnel, something

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:90%
that shows transition.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.580 align:middle line:84%
In the third experience,
instead of floating

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:53.050 align:middle line:84%
above like the first two,
I was 22 years later.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:90%
And it was brain surgery.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I was standing by the
bed watching myself.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was an OBE.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.220 align:middle line:90%
I was watching myself.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And as I moved to the place that
where I floated above normally

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:07.690 align:middle line:84%
before, the first two
times, I realized that this

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.310 align:middle line:90%
was a dimension in itself.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.990 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a transition
period where

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:84%
you could watch what's
going on and then you

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:84%
go down the tunnel,
it was a level

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.290 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness in itself.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.180 align:middle line:90%
And I saw beings there.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
people who were trapped.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
Bardos to the Tibetans

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.702 align:middle line:90%
and like the purgatory.

00:28:26.702 --> 00:28:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they screaming?

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: No.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing like that.

00:28:29.565 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: What people--
free will, George--

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.580 align:middle line:84%
because we are
electrical beings.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Free will sets up that you don't
have to go down the tunnel.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.180 align:middle line:84%
There are people-- why
I created the Twilight

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Brigade was because I saw
veterans that felt deserted.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.325 align:middle line:84%
I saw periods of
people in uniforms--

00:28:45.325 --> 00:28:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was very smart
and astute of you to do that.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Because
it's just me.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw people who didn't
want to go down that tunnel

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:54.662 align:middle line:84%
because they had
been abused and they

00:28:54.662 --> 00:28:55.870 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to go down there.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And then there were psychopaths
and alcoholics and drug addicts

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:84%
still trying to
get back over here,

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.520 align:middle line:84%
still trying to
get back over here

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and not accept the fact that
they had already transitioned.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I then understood
where a ghost came from,

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.460 align:middle line:84%
what possessions operate,
how that comes about.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
that until 1997.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.450 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So there are a standard
way you leave this world.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.540 align:middle line:90%
It's structured.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.260 align:middle line:90%
It's orderly.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, for my first time,
I'm struck by lightning,

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.670 align:middle line:84%
hits me in the side of the
neck, throws me in the air,

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:33.070 align:middle line:90%
slams me back down the bed.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.260 align:middle line:84%
It knocks me out of
my shoes, George.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm burning.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm on fire.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:90%
And I can't see.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.090 align:middle line:90%
And the next thing--

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because it went
down my spine and burnt--

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had these
markings all over me.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.450 align:middle line:84%
It burned off like
an inch of my beard.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But the place I went to, I
could see, there was no pain,

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and I could move
from severe pain.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.770 align:middle line:90%
I was completely paralyzed--

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:00.937 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then you had
to come back again, right?

00:30:00.937 --> 00:30:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: --and
make that body work.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.330 align:middle line:90%
I had to come back--

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did that take time?

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Years?

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:05.447 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Two years.

00:30:05.447 --> 00:30:06.540 align:middle line:90%
It took two years.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would pass out and
fall over and wet myself and--

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the most horrible--

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I was my first hospice patient.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So I understood what goes on
when you're losing control.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm my first hospice patient.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.700 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
tell me about what

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.760 align:middle line:84%
happens to people as
they get ready to go

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.920 align:middle line:90%
and how you prepare for it.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to
understand, how do you

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:84%
prepare for helping someone
transition without you getting

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:41.550 align:middle line:84%
involved in the
abandonment issue?

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.620 align:middle line:84%
People feel that
they're being abandoned

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and they put people that
they love through things

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.300 align:middle line:90%
that are not necessary.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you know what I know,
then the supportiveness

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:84%
of that and the techniques that
you use bring closure for you.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:90%
It brings closure for them.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:middle line:90%
It sets a value in their life.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.912 align:middle line:84%
And you can let them go
knowing you'll see them again,

00:31:03.912 --> 00:31:05.370 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you'll
see them again.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can let him go
because that part was done.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.760 align:middle line:84%
The continuity and the
continualization of life

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:90%
is the point we have to accept.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did these
out-of-body experiences

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:21.082 align:middle line:84%
and after-death experiences
make you a better person?

00:31:21.082 --> 00:31:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: [LAUGHS] You
already know the answer

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.210 align:middle line:90%
to that, George!

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:26.940 align:middle line:90%
I was a jerk.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, arrogant, pompous,
humiliating, dehumanizing

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:38.880 align:middle line:84%
people and cynical
and snide, you know.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.200 align:middle line:84%
But once you see
it-- well, come on.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.000 align:middle line:90%
And once you see--

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You changed.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.550 align:middle line:90%
I can attest to that.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: You have no choice.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.420 align:middle line:90%
I tried to get away from it.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.780 align:middle line:90%
I tried to stay away from it.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:50.580 align:middle line:90%
But what they do?

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.970 align:middle line:90%
They killed me again.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:52.770 align:middle line:90%
I got struck--

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:53.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And again.

00:31:53.868 --> 00:31:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: I got
struck by lightning

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:90%
because I rejected it.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.258 align:middle line:84%
And then once I met Raymond
and looked at all the people

00:32:00.258 --> 00:32:01.800 align:middle line:84%
that were writing
about it and listen

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.720 align:middle line:84%
to people talking about
their experiences,

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.040 align:middle line:90%
I needed it to go away.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Because watch this,
George, people

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.640 align:middle line:84%
want you to stay the same
even if it's not good,

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.500 align:middle line:90%
because you create change.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.940 align:middle line:84%
My father was watching the
change in me and watching--

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and who knows me really well
like my brother and sister--

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.440 align:middle line:90%
and they still didn't--

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.160 align:middle line:84%
everybody wanted me
to stay the same.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want me to become
the person that I was becoming,

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.730 align:middle line:90%
even as bad as I was.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:34.358 align:middle line:84%
And why I created the character
that's Dannion was there's

00:32:34.358 --> 00:32:36.650 align:middle line:84%
people who are having this
kind of experience, George--

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the time.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: --and
nobody listens to them.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, they're all alone.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.123 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: And they
have no one to talk to,

00:32:41.123 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:90%
and they feel helpless.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And somebody has to stand up
for those people's rights.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And I decided they might
as well pick on me.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I would take on anybody that
thinks that the near-death

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:52.490 align:middle line:90%
experience--

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
difficult to pick on.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Yeah, well, come
get you some's all I could tell

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:56.713 align:middle line:90%
them because--

00:32:56.713 --> 00:32:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bring it on, right?

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the rules,
let's get to it.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.447 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I want to look at--

00:33:01.447 --> 00:33:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Guy Finley was on Gaia's
"Inspirations" show

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.740 align:middle line:90%
with Lisa Garr.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.788 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what he has to say.

00:33:06.788 --> 00:33:08.330 align:middle line:10%
>>GUY FINLEY: When
we think of death,

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.455 align:middle line:10%
what are we thinking about?

00:33:09.455 --> 00:33:10.938 align:middle line:10%
Fear of the unknown.

00:33:10.938 --> 00:33:12.605 align:middle line:10%
Did you know you can't
fear the unknown?

00:33:12.605 --> 00:33:15.493 align:middle line:10%


00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: OK,
you got me there.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:17.780 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.800 align:middle line:10%
>>FINLEY: You can't.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.260 align:middle line:10%
You can only fear the known.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.150 align:middle line:10%
And you can't know
what death is.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.310 align:middle line:10%
>>GARR: People fear the
unknown all the time.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.510 align:middle line:10%
>>FINLEY: No, they don't.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.810 align:middle line:10%
They fear what their mind
tells them is going to happen

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.640 align:middle line:10%
and they call that unknown.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.720 align:middle line:90%
You can't fear what is unknown.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.410 align:middle line:90%
What is unknown, you don't know.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.350 align:middle line:90%
We fear the known.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.695 align:middle line:90%
Our mind paints these pictures.

00:33:40.695 --> 00:33:42.570 align:middle line:10%
Remember, when we started
talking about this?

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.680 align:middle line:10%
I said, no fear without
negative imagination?

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.170 align:middle line:10%
So here I am, I'm sick
and now-- and listen,

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.380 align:middle line:10%
even deeper than that, I'm
sick and what I really fear

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.140 align:middle line:10%
is that I'm going to be
inadequate to this thing.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.910 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what's
going to happen to me.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.020 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how
I'm going to be.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.680 align:middle line:10%
I've been pushing
down a lot of stuff,

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.570 align:middle line:10%
it's all going to come up.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.250 align:middle line:10%
People are going to
see me the way I am.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.600 align:middle line:10%
Oh my God, no, no, no.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.940 align:middle line:10%
So it's all fear of the known,
not fear of the unknown.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:10%
>>GARR: So fear of death
is fear of going somewhere

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.060 align:middle line:10%
where we really don't
know where we're going?

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:16.340 align:middle line:10%
>>FINLEY: Fear of death is
the movement on a part of us

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.429 align:middle line:10%
that believes, unless it
knows where it's going,

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.688 align:middle line:10%
that place doesn't exist.

00:34:21.688 --> 00:34:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you agree with him?

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:23.449 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: No.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't?

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.949 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think so.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: But he's
wording it reasonably sane.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.010 align:middle line:84%
People are afraid
of the unknown,

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:33.710 align:middle line:84%
but you have religions,
institutions, and governments

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.610 align:middle line:90%
that construct the reality.

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
pharmacology and psychiatrists

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:90%
that give meaning to it.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Then you have philosophy.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.219 align:middle line:10%
But nonetheless, you will
take your last breath here.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:45.929 align:middle line:90%
This is what will happen.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And the more you're
prepared for it

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and the more you understand
it and the better that you

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.679 align:middle line:84%
understand it, the more
living you're going to do.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:57.170 align:middle line:84%
When you look at all those
things combined, George,

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:84%
we have come to the end of an
era as foretold for 45 years.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.460 align:middle line:90%
And that era is here.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And the next two years are
critical in our thinking

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:84%
about how we view
our health care

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.380 align:middle line:90%
and how we view our destiny.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Because when you start
giving up your rights

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and you start giving up the
control of your own body,

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.550 align:middle line:84%
the only way that can happen
is through health care.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And if the battle for
the souls of humankind

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.550 align:middle line:84%
is going to be fought in health
care, we are presently there.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And that moment to wake
up and realize this--

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:31.340 align:middle line:90%
and I've said this for years--

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.580 align:middle line:84%
you are a great, powerful,
and mighty spiritual being

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.820 align:middle line:84%
with dignity,
direction, and purpose.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
that can ever go wrong

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:43.430 align:middle line:84%
is you allow something to
affect your dignity which

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.370 align:middle line:84%
skews your direction
and your purpose.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Once that sets in play,
there are two things, George,

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.220 align:middle line:84%
that never happen in
the spiritual world.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.360 align:middle line:90%
They never happen.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:90%
They don't exist.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.690 align:middle line:84%
That is helplessness
and loneliness.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:58.728 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:35:58.728 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
people that feel that way.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.728 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Helplessness
comes when you're born

00:36:02.728 --> 00:36:03.770 align:middle line:90%
and when you leave.

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And loneliness creates
what's called despair.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Those things don't exist
until you come here.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.530 align:middle line:84%
To be helpless and to be
lonely and to practice

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.330 align:middle line:84%
being a divine
being or to practice

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.970 align:middle line:84%
being a compassionate
being is the rules

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.820 align:middle line:90%
that you come here under.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Something that does
not happen, like death,

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:28.170 align:middle line:84%
there is no religion
that I've ever

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.730 align:middle line:84%
seen that describes
death the way

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I've watched it for 45 years and
been at the bedside of people

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.080 align:middle line:84%
going from this world to the
next and people resuscitated.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.400 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to tell me.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.560 align:middle line:90%
There is an art form.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And that art form is so
consistent, so loving,

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:84%
so compassionate,
and so structured.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:48.510 align:middle line:84%
To not know about it so you
get the most out of your life

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.670 align:middle line:90%
is a mistake that we're making.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Because our health care
is going to be where,

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.937 align:middle line:84%
what will you not do to
protect your parents,

00:36:55.937 --> 00:36:58.020 align:middle line:84%
take care of your children
and your grandchildren,

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.150 align:middle line:90%
and look after yourself?

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.820 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:90%
That's how it will work.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we are now.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where
is forgiveness

00:37:05.545 --> 00:37:06.530 align:middle line:90%
fit into this equation?

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY:
Forgiveness is power.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness is power.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not weakness.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is an
internal structure

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that you take as if you are
divine, that you are divine.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:25.990 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at it and
what was the intention of why

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.130 align:middle line:90%
this happened.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to stop for a
second and look at why.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:34.090 align:middle line:84%
A spiritual being, George, can
never see itself as a victim.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen
myself as a victim.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never?

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Not even the first time?

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Never as a victim.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wrong
place, wrong time?

00:37:41.035 --> 00:37:42.415 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: I had it coming.

00:37:42.415 --> 00:37:43.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] You know?

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.100 align:middle line:90%
That's how I--

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I had it coming.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.317 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
kicked you back?

00:37:47.317 --> 00:37:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Well, you know--

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And again and again.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Well--

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't want you.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: Well, long
ago, George, someone said--

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.780 align:middle line:84%
she said Dannion, why do you
think that they picked you?

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think you were chosen
for this mission, and all this?

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I already
know the answer to that.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.010 align:middle line:84%
They had completely
run out of messiahs

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and they were scraping the
absolute bottom of the barrel.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they found you and.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BRINKLEY: Yeah.

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:10%
And Michael and Gabriel
were down at the cloud bar

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.930 align:middle line:10%
doing angel shots and
they said, I got an idea.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:10%
Let's go find a jackass,
let's go kill Dannion,

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.720 align:middle line:10%
and pile this off on him.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.120 align:middle line:10%
Ta-da.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And here he is.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.540 align:middle line:10%
>>BRINKLEY: And here I still am.

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.430 align:middle line:10%
But do you know what, George?

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to thank you and
Gaia and you doing this show.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:36.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are
in need of getting

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.500 align:middle line:84%
a grip on who they
really are as opposed

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.270 align:middle line:84%
to who they're
being told they are,

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and to hold on that deeply,
spiritually, and committed.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dannion, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BRINKLEY: George, thank you
so very much for having me.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
doing this show.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love this program.

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:56.080 align:middle line:10%
And more importantly,
Dannion has taught us all not

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.070 align:middle line:10%
to fear death.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.880 align:middle line:10%
We're in no rush to get there.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.080 align:middle line:84%
But when that time
comes, we'll be ready.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
