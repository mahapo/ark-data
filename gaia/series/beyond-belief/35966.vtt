welcome back to Beyond Belief

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.405 align:middle line:84%
with our very special
guest, Karen Dolman.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.275 align:middle line:84%
She's the author of
course of two works,

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:46.213 align:middle line:84%
The Spirit of Creativity and
the Spirits of Ouija as we talk

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.682 align:middle line:84%
about just what's
on the other side.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.885 align:middle line:84%
You know, Karen,
this is something all

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:53.787 align:middle line:90%
of us are going to have to face.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.789 align:middle line:90%
We're going to make that journey

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.025 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:03.496 align:middle line:84%
So kind of tell us what we
can expect on the other side.

tell you what you can expect

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.434 align:middle line:84%
from what I've learned
and gleaned from my work

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:84%
with the spirits that
are on the other side

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.039 align:middle line:84%
and these are mostly
discarnate spirits,

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.609 align:middle line:84%
meaning they have never been
born in a physical body.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.113 align:middle line:84%
What they say is that you can
expect an easy transition.

00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:22.683 align:middle line:90%
It's not scary, it's not hard.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:23.784 align:middle line:90%
They're there to help you.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:25.219 align:middle line:84%
There's always spirits
there to meet you.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:90%
It could be deceased loved ones,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.824 align:middle line:84%
it can also be these discarnate
spirits, maybe an angel

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.194 align:middle line:84%
or guardians that have
been around you forever.

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:36.263 align:middle line:84%
And what they say sometimes
happens is sometimes people,

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:39.233 align:middle line:84%
when they pass over,
they're a little afraid

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:40.634 align:middle line:84%
of the light, not
sure what to do.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:41.869 align:middle line:90%

these spirits over there

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:44.104 align:middle line:90%
and I speak to three of them.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:47.074 align:middle line:84%
They're called helping
spirits, healing spirits,

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:48.876 align:middle line:84%
and they actually
stay in this light

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:50.444 align:middle line:84%
to help people do
the transition.

we knew in our living life?

guys are not, I said guys.

really no sex

00:01:57.952 --> 00:01:59.353 align:middle line:90%
to them although they come to me

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:01.422 align:middle line:84%
and they might feel more
feminine or masculine.

00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:02.489 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.791 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: I say that,
that's why I'm laughing

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:06.293 align:middle line:84%
because they're really
androgenous in a way.

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:09.196 align:middle line:84%
They're over there, but
yes they also bring,

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
or you should say your relatives
come through too to help you.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.238 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's a stuckness,
if you will, when people pass

00:02:17.238 --> 00:02:18.505 align:middle line:90%
over and it's not a bad thing.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.341 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they need
extra help with some

00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:21.875 align:middle line:90%
of these other spirits.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.311 align:middle line:84%
And these spirits, the
healing spirits of the light

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:28.215 align:middle line:84%
who might stay with you in
this space protecting you,

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:30.417 align:middle line:84%
helping you, loving you,
guiding you, learning--

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:33.621 align:middle line:84%
you're always evolving
when you pass over.

00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:35.189 align:middle line:84%
There's always more
lessons to learn.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.292 align:middle line:84%
There's always some-- a
life review, there's a time

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:42.096 align:middle line:84%
to understand what's next
for you or where you've been,

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:44.498 align:middle line:84%
what areas in your life
you can grow within

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.133 align:middle line:90%
and it just continues.

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.368 align:middle line:90%

the other side was much

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.138 align:middle line:90%
like the dream state.

When you're in your dream you
never eat, you never get hungry.

00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:57.811 align:middle line:90%
You just go on and on and on

00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:00.714 align:middle line:84%
into whatever dream
you might have had.

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:05.719 align:middle line:84%
Is it like that in that
you're somewhat in a fog

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.088 align:middle line:90%
but it's like a dream?

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:09.023 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yeah.

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:10.357 align:middle line:84%
Well, in my dreams
I eat sometimes.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.959 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: See, I've never
eaten in my dream.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:12.526 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: I have.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Never.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.261 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yeah.

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.096 align:middle line:84%
Oh, okay. Well, maybe
you have anorexic dreams.

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I will eat in my dreams.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.602 align:middle line:84%
But it's like that
and what I've learned,

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:23.836 align:middle line:84%
one of the things they've
taught me about the soul is

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:27.975 align:middle line:84%
that the soul has an easier time
communicating with our own self.

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Our soul is this energy
that comes and goes.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.112 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily stuck
in our physical body.

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:35.282 align:middle line:84%
It's with our incarnation,
but it's that part of ourself,

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:38.585 align:middle line:84%
this is what they teach me
now, that goes back to source.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:43.624 align:middle line:84%
The soul transcends the corporal
world and the spiritual world.

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:45.893 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit of
both, but it can communicate

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:47.928 align:middle line:84%
with us the best
within the dream state

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:51.298 align:middle line:84%
because in the dream state
we're open, we're uninhibited,

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:53.901 align:middle line:84%
anything can happen, right,
anything that you wish,

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:57.004 align:middle line:84%
if you become able to
control your dreams

00:03:57.004 --> 00:03:58.605 align:middle line:90%
in terms of lucid dream.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Lucid dream, sure.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.674 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Right, a lot
of people will work.

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:02.242 align:middle line:84%
It's a goal that
people have to do.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.078 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't-- you don't
necessarily have to do that,

00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:06.547 align:middle line:84%
but that's one way
you can have all kinds

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:07.881 align:middle line:90%
of contact with your soul.

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:10.384 align:middle line:84%
But your soul is there talking
to you in the dream state

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:14.421 align:middle line:84%
as well is what I've learned,
what they like to teach.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.757 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great space
to be in to have

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:18.925 align:middle line:90%
that ease in communication.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.929 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: When your years
start to click by you begin

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
to pay a little bit
more attention

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.133 align:middle line:90%
to people who have passed on.

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:30.704 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, being in Los
Angeles most of the time,

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:35.041 align:middle line:84%
you know, you see all these
stories of these movie stars

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.746 align:middle line:84%
and TV stars and other
celebrities who have died,

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:42.616 align:middle line:84%
whether it was a Frank
Sinatra, or Sammy Davis Junior,

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:44.451 align:middle line:90%
or just about anybody.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:47.354 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
realize that, you know,

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
your life has got this
certain time limit

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.459 align:middle line:90%
to it and then you move on.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:57.364 align:middle line:84%
But I am fascinated by the
fact that they move on,

00:04:57.364 --> 00:05:00.033 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what things are
like for them, those people

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:04.505 align:middle line:84%
who had incredible notoriety
in their physical life.

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:06.473 align:middle line:90%
Are they comfortable?

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.709 align:middle line:90%
Is it easy for them?

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:09.977 align:middle line:90%
Are they frustrated?

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:11.578 align:middle line:90%
What happens to them?

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.614 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, you know, I
haven't spoke to anybody famous

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:15.649 align:middle line:90%
like that but I will say this,

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.985 align:middle line:84%
is that there is
a confidentiality

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:20.287 align:middle line:84%
but it's the release
of the personality

00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:23.891 align:middle line:84%
so when you realize-- okay,
let's back up here a little bit

00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:25.826 align:middle line:84%
and I can talk about maybe
the different between spirits

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:27.761 align:middle line:90%
and ghosts and hauntings.

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:30.631 align:middle line:84%
This might help us understand
this, what you brought up.

00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:31.698 align:middle line:90%
When you pass over,

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:33.867 align:middle line:84%
a dead person is now--
becomes a spirit.

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:35.335 align:middle line:84%
They go back into
their spiritual form.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.838 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when they
hold onto their personality,

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:39.807 align:middle line:84%
afraid to leave it,
there's that piece

00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
of them that's just pulling
them back to the reality

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.946 align:middle line:84%
of the physical,
the corporal world.

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:47.147 align:middle line:90%
That can cause a haunting,

00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that can cause a
poltergeist-like activity.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.051 align:middle line:84%
It can make a person
become now--

00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:53.320 align:middle line:84%
a spirit become like
more of a ghost,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.355 align:middle line:84%
and I talk about the
differences in different stories

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.791 align:middle line:84%
in that new book of mine, the
Spirits of Ouija where I do talk

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.761 align:middle line:84%
about the difference between
the two and also some--

00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:02.429 align:middle line:90%
I give some good examples

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:04.731 align:middle line:84%
of these ghosts I've
run into and spirits.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.367 align:middle line:84%
So when I answer question like
Sammy Davis Junior, you know,

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.904 align:middle line:84%
Frank Sinatra, which
I love their work,

00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:11.839 align:middle line:90%
you know, I don't know.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, but I do know--

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.108 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Are they singing
on the other side?

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:16.743 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: You know, you can
take your talents with you,

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.745 align:middle line:84%
but there's-- you
drop your personality

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:20.914 align:middle line:90%
and that allows you to move on.

00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:23.317 align:middle line:84%
The idea is not to be
attached to that still.

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:24.952 align:middle line:84%
When they first pass over
what I have learned is

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:27.754 align:middle line:84%
that they will be a part
of that personality still

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:30.324 align:middle line:84%
because they're here
to kind of help us

00:06:30.324 --> 00:06:32.459 align:middle line:84%
when we're mourning
their loss for--

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:35.195 align:middle line:84%
as the example with
the gal in my sorority

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:37.698 align:middle line:84%
who was mourning her sister's
loss and her sister had to come

00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:40.067 align:middle line:90%
through and tell her, I am fine.

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:41.835 align:middle line:84%
So they're there
to tell us that.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:43.036 align:middle line:90%
And so maybe he there's dancing,

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.671 align:middle line:84%
Sammy Davis Junior's
tap dancing in a way.

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:46.673 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he could be.

00:06:46.673 --> 00:06:48.909 align:middle line:90%
He's doing what he enjoys best.

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.178 align:middle line:84%
He's doing what allows his
soul to grow, whatever that is.

00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:52.679 align:middle line:90%
Who am I to say what that is?

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:55.215 align:middle line:84%
Only he would know,
but the spirits do say,

00:06:55.215 --> 00:06:58.218 align:middle line:84%
and people that pass on
said they are learning new

00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:00.988 align:middle line:84%
techniques, new ideas,
new concepts.

00:07:00.988 --> 00:07:03.056 align:middle line:84%
Things maybe I didn't quite
embrace when they were alive

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:05.092 align:middle line:84%
or things they wanted
to know more about.

00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:08.095 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a school,
if you will.

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:11.798 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: When you go to bed
and then you fall asleep,

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:16.803 align:middle line:84%
very rarely do you remember that
moment that you fell asleep.

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:18.605 align:middle line:90%
You just, you're out.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.208 align:middle line:90%
And is dying much like that?

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:24.878 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are you-- let's say
you're in a hospital room

00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:30.918 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the bed and
do you just go like that,

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:32.953 align:middle line:84%
like you do when
you're sleeping?

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:34.521 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well they say, and I
don't want to scare anybody

00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:35.722 align:middle line:84%
because it's not like
you're going to fall asleep

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and little kids worry
about that,

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.125 align:middle line:84%
if I fall asleep well
does that mean I die?

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:40.561 align:middle line:84%
I've heard those kind
of questions before.

00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:42.863 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really want to equate
it with sleep, but you're right.

00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:45.799 align:middle line:84%
That transition process to your
dream state is what they tell me

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.134 align:middle line:90%
it's like when you die,

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:49.803 align:middle line:84%
no matter how horrific your
death was, you can still be

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.104 align:middle line:90%
that same kind of transition.

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:52.272 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Absolutely.

00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:52.906 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yeah.

00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:53.874 align:middle line:90%
So it's a gentle.

00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:54.675 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Whether it's
tragic or not.

00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:55.976 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yeah, right.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.145 align:middle line:84%
The tragic's [inaudible]
will knock the spirits

00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:00.881 align:middle line:84%
on the other side just a
little off their balance

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:84%
where they have to kind of,
maybe needs a little extra help.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.786 align:middle line:84%
You know, maybe they
went through a serious,

00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:09.289 align:middle line:84%
horrific illness that requires
a little extra help too

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:12.593 align:middle line:84%
on the other side to-- infirmary
if you will, where they can heal

00:08:12.593 --> 00:08:15.295 align:middle line:84%
and be taken care of, but
they're always around.

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:18.465 align:middle line:84%
It's-- there's always loving
influences around them.

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in this whole
Dante's Inferno or purgatory,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.005 align:middle line:90%
you know, or the hell.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.773 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you might see
hellish things

00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:28.642 align:middle line:90%
if that's part of your reality.

00:08:28.642 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have
to look at a lot

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.945 align:middle line:84%
of times what we believe is
what we're going to experience,

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:35.916 align:middle line:84%
and that goes in
the afterlife too.

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:37.984 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We've talked about
in the religion talks

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:84%
about being a good person
before you die, right.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.994 align:middle line:84%
So they drill into us all
these things and these rules

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:49.596 align:middle line:84%
that you should live
by in order to get

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:53.066 align:middle line:90%
to a higher level when you die.

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:57.638 align:middle line:84%
Is that important or can
you be a horrendous human,

00:08:57.638 --> 00:09:01.942 align:middle line:84%
absolutely horrendous and still
get through on the other side?

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:04.278 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well I believe the source
loves us all and we're all

00:09:04.278 --> 00:09:06.713 align:middle line:84%
from the source so we all
came from a light source.

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:10.083 align:middle line:84%
And a lack of light
would be just a darkness.

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:12.052 align:middle line:84%
And so as soon as we turn
our backs to the light,

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.788 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reasons that we
become horrific and horrendous,

00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:17.024 align:middle line:84%
and I would say I'm more
scared of live people

00:09:17.024 --> 00:09:18.725 align:middle line:84%
than dead people
for that reason.

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.127 align:middle line:84%
That there's more of an
awareness when you die

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:22.829 align:middle line:84%
because you have helpers over
there of a similar consciousness

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:25.499 align:middle line:84%
or energy where they will
also help you work with this.

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:28.135 align:middle line:84%
On this side a lot of the times
it's the blind leading the

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:31.038 align:middle line:84%
blind, you know, where
over there it's a little--

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:34.241 align:middle line:84%
there's a little more
structure and help, if you will,

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
on that side to guide you
in the right directions.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.814 align:middle line:84%
So I would-- moving over
to that side, you know,

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:44.851 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't really be fearful
of that or worried about that

00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:84%
because they are going to have
the help they need once they get

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.288 align:middle line:90%
over there.

00:09:48.288 --> 00:09:50.223 align:middle line:84%
But if they're horrific and
horrendous, they're still going

00:09:50.223 --> 00:09:52.092 align:middle line:84%
to be loved, still
going to be welcomed.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:55.128 align:middle line:84%
It's like the prodigal son
story from the bible, right,

00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:57.264 align:middle line:84%
and he comes back
and he's still loved

00:09:57.264 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and in fact given all the graces
and the gifts of the father.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.802 align:middle line:90%
It's saying that too.

00:10:01.802 --> 00:10:05.038 align:middle line:84%
You are no different, but you
need to look at yourself now.

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:08.742 align:middle line:84%
Now you have an awareness
to say I did that?

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:10.911 align:middle line:84%
My personality did--
that's horrible.

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:13.547 align:middle line:84%
You know, how am I going
to make a mends for this?

00:10:13.547 --> 00:10:16.683 align:middle line:84%
There is an idea of an eye for
an eye retribution, if you will.

00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:17.684 align:middle line:90%
You can call it karmic law.

00:10:17.684 --> 00:10:19.019 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people call it karma.

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:20.721 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Karma, and
I've seen that happen.

00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:21.822 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yeah.

00:10:21.822 --> 00:10:22.656 align:middle line:84%
You'll see a [inaudible]
life happen, right.

00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:23.657 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Do spirits communicate

00:10:23.657 --> 00:10:25.058 align:middle line:84%
with other spirits
on the other side?

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:26.026 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Oh, they do.

00:10:26.026 --> 00:10:26.827 align:middle line:90%
They talk.

00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:27.728 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they do.

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:28.595 align:middle line:90%
They interact together.

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:29.896 align:middle line:90%
In fact, they'll come to me

00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:32.566 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes a mouth piece
spirit will come forward,

00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:34.401 align:middle line:84%
meaning all of them together
have one person that's going

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:36.336 align:middle line:90%
to represent them at this forum,

00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:38.038 align:middle line:84%
at this round table
discussion tonight.

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:39.806 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What do they tall about?

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.174 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: They talk about
what they're working

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:42.242 align:middle line:90%
on with the other people.

00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:90%
I ask them these questions.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.912 align:middle line:84%
I love this because these
are questions I ask them.

00:10:45.912 --> 00:10:47.814 align:middle line:84%
Well what are you doing
on the other side?

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:50.517 align:middle line:84%
And they're working with
other people that passed over,

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:51.785 align:middle line:90%
they're helping each other,

00:10:51.785 --> 00:10:53.120 align:middle line:84%
they're communicating how
they're going to do that.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.055 align:middle line:84%
They get their game
plan together.

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:57.858 align:middle line:84%
They're talking with the
people that have passed on.

00:10:57.858 --> 00:10:59.092 align:middle line:90%
It's never pushing somebody

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:00.327 align:middle line:84%
to be something they
don't want to be.

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:01.628 align:middle line:90%
It's never pushing somebody

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:03.563 align:middle line:84%
against their own
volition again.

00:11:03.563 --> 00:11:06.233 align:middle line:84%
It's always helping them to
activate that within themselves.

00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:08.668 align:middle line:84%
So they help them on the other
side they same way they help me

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:12.639 align:middle line:84%
on this side, activate what--
myself, what's inside of me,

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:16.877 align:middle line:84%
my grandeur, and help activate
the grandeur of the spirit

00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:18.845 align:middle line:84%
of that person that
passed over too.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:21.882 align:middle line:84%
So they help you, not
make you, not force you.

00:11:21.882 --> 00:11:22.916 align:middle line:84%
It's always of your
own volition,

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:25.252 align:middle line:90%
it's always of free will.

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:29.589 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Some spirits are
confused when they die.

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:31.892 align:middle line:84%
I remember a phone
call I had once

00:11:31.892 --> 00:11:35.162 align:middle line:84%
where an emergency
medical technician called

00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:40.767 align:middle line:84%
and she was driving and
witnessed a car accident,

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:45.038 align:middle line:84%
single car accident, and the
body was outside the car,

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:47.374 align:middle line:84%
so it must have gotten
flipped out of the car.

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:47.941 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yeah.

00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:48.975 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:11:48.975 --> 00:11:50.143 align:middle line:84%
So she-- she's all
alone on this road.

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:51.178 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:11:51.178 --> 00:11:55.715 align:middle line:84%
She gets there and
she runs to the body

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:90%
and she's looking around.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.685 align:middle line:90%
She's got to call somebody.

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:00.687 align:middle line:90%
She needs help immediately.

00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:03.623 align:middle line:84%
She sees a guy on the side
of the road standing there

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:07.828 align:middle line:84%
and she's yelling to him
please, call for help.

00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:11.631 align:middle line:84%
And the guy was just like
in a daze, just watching her

00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:90%
like this not saying anything.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.969 align:middle line:84%
And she's saying
please call for help

00:12:15.969 --> 00:12:18.171 align:middle line:90%
and he's just standing there.

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:21.808 align:middle line:84%
Well, she flips over the
body-- it's that guy.

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:23.243 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Oh, wow.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.145 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And she swears by it.

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:26.112 align:middle line:90%

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:29.115 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: She looks
over and he's gone.

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:32.219 align:middle line:84%
So in immediate deaths
like that, car accident,

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:35.455 align:middle line:84%
body gets tossed out
of the car, he's dead.

00:12:35.455 --> 00:12:37.991 align:middle line:84%
The spirit is a little
disjointed isn't it?

>> KD: It can be.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.493 align:middle line:84%
In that case we're
assuming it was

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:41.928 align:middle line:84%
because it wouldn't
communicate back.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.897 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was just
amazed at watching.

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:44.965 align:middle line:90%
This is my body.

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:46.933 align:middle line:84%

it now or maybe--

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.034 align:middle line:90%

00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:50.136 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what to do.

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.439 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe at that moment it was a
choice too where he could choose

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:54.975 align:middle line:84%
to go back and go on
or he could choose

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:56.743 align:middle line:90%
to go on to the other side.

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:58.078 align:middle line:90%
You know, we don't really know,

00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:01.214 align:middle line:84%
but that's really a fascinating
story and I've heard some

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
of these stories like
this before where they do,

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.052 align:middle line:84%
people do run into
a spirit that's just

00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:07.921 align:middle line:90%
disembodied immediately.

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:11.157 align:middle line:84%
There can be a jostled up
effect where they're not sure

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:12.993 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the other
spirits will come in and help.

00:13:12.993 --> 00:13:14.828 align:middle line:84%
I mean they're not--
nobody's left alone.

00:13:14.828 --> 00:13:16.229 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:18.331 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Even how horrific they
can be, they're not left alone.

00:13:18.331 --> 00:13:21.701 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Most after
death stories I hear,

00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle line:90%
they don't want to come back.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:28.875 align:middle line:84%
It's the entities on the other
side that kind of push them back

00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:90%
and say it's not your time.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.178 align:middle line:90%
You have to go back.

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:37.751 align:middle line:84%
Why do they have that feeling of
solitude where when they do die,

00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:40.487 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to come back
and they have that ability,

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.622 align:middle line:90%
they have that option.

00:13:42.622 --> 00:13:44.224 align:middle line:84%
They just want to stay
on the other side.

00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:45.892 align:middle line:90%
How come? Is it that pleasant?

00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:47.327 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: I don't blame--
yeah, that's what I hear.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:50.997 align:middle line:84%
That's what I-- I haven't had
a near death experience, NDE's,

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I just know what they've
told me and it's a--

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.768 align:middle line:90%
more of a pleasant experience.

00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:56.503 align:middle line:84%
See, and that's something
for people to understand.

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.939 align:middle line:84%
There isn't this
negativity when you die.

00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:01.741 align:middle line:84%
And that-- every time I speak
to somebody whose just passed on

00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:05.845 align:middle line:84%
or has a message to their loved
ones, they'll tell them that,

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:10.116 align:middle line:84%
that there is no pain, it's
actually a lovely place to be.

00:14:10.116 --> 00:14:11.251 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they didn't
always choose it,

00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:12.485 align:middle line:90%
maybe they do choose it.

00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:15.155 align:middle line:84%
In the cases that I've--
the spirits or ghosts--

00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:16.957 align:middle line:90%
or spirits I've spoken to,

00:14:16.957 --> 00:14:18.191 align:middle line:84%
it was like they
didn't really have--

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:20.393 align:middle line:84%
the choice was they were--
it was their time to go.

00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:21.828 align:middle line:90%
That was the message I received.

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that they
had that choice.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.032 align:middle line:84%
But you can have that
choice and especially

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:90%
if there's more for you to do.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.169 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
that I've learned working

00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:31.838 align:middle line:84%
with this tool, and I'm just
going to say this tool here,

00:14:31.838 --> 00:14:36.409 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a
greatness within each of us

00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:38.144 align:middle line:90%
and we need to activate that.

00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:41.948 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times we're asked
to go back to activate that.

00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:44.784 align:middle line:84%
And it might be the NDE that
brings a person to that.

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:48.021 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times in our lives,
and I speak to women and men

00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:50.724 align:middle line:84%
about this a lot, especially
when I used to be a therapist,

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:53.293 align:middle line:84%
my practice was there
comes a point in your life

00:14:53.293 --> 00:14:56.029 align:middle line:84%
when there's sometimes
a real chaotic event

00:14:56.029 --> 00:15:00.266 align:middle line:84%
or a traumatic episode that's
traumatic in however you want

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:84%
to describe it to yourself,
that pushes you to be greater

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.139 align:middle line:84%
than you are, than
you think you can be.

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:08.174 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe those spirits
on your side are doing--

00:15:08.174 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
they're applauding
us and cheering us

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.313 align:middle line:84%
on every time we choose
love over hate or fear.

00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:14.781 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the opposite
of love is fear.

00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And they applaud us and
they know that we do that,

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.487 align:middle line:84%
the more love that we
acknowledge within ourselves,

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:22.088 align:middle line:84%
the more we're getting
closer and going to get

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:24.657 align:middle line:84%
to this great gifts and
talents that we have within,

00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:27.861 align:middle line:84%
and that's a lot of times why
we have to stay and come back

00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:30.663 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill that if you
will because that helps all

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, when we
fill those greatness

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.368 align:middle line:90%
and the gifts within ourselves.

00:15:35.368 --> 00:15:38.738 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Our Beyond Belief camera
and our phones are ringing.

00:15:38.738 --> 00:15:41.408 align:middle line:90%
Let's get a question for Karen.

00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:42.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Mike: Hi, Karen.

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:44.844 align:middle line:84%
I'm Mike from Colorado and
I was wondering what really

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:45.678 align:middle line:90%
scares you?

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:48.915 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What scares you, Karen?

00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:50.884 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well to be
honest with you guys,

00:15:50.884 --> 00:15:53.053 align:middle line:84%
is that when I was young
I was scared of the dark.

00:15:53.053 --> 00:15:55.755 align:middle line:84%
I was scared of the dark
for many years and it's

00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:59.325 align:middle line:84%
because I would experience
all this paranormal activity.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:01.461 align:middle line:84%
You know, I could feel and I
could sense it, I could see it

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:05.198 align:middle line:84%
and that was scary to me because
I couldn't quite place it

00:16:05.198 --> 00:16:09.135 align:middle line:84%
into a neat box and explain
what I was experiencing,

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.671 align:middle line:84%
but as I began working
with the board

00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:15.575 align:middle line:84%
and I really understood what
its uses were in my 20s,

00:16:15.575 --> 00:16:19.479 align:middle line:84%
that's when I really lost
that fear of the dark.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:23.616 align:middle line:84%
It decreased, as well as a fear
of what happens when you die

00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:28.088 align:middle line:84%
or a fear of negative
energies because I don't--

00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:30.356 align:middle line:84%
I haven't experienced them
and when they do come forward,

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:32.358 align:middle line:90%
I let them push them away.

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:33.993 align:middle line:84%
Maybe because of my beliefs
and what I've learned

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:36.329 align:middle line:90%
through the board, so I don't--

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:39.466 align:middle line:84%
it's really helped me not
have that sense of fear.

00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:42.335 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I would say
I fear GMOs and people

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:43.736 align:middle line:90%
that are alive more than--

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:44.571 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:45.672 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yeah, more than I fear--

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:46.773 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do you sleep
with your arm hanging

00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:48.508 align:middle line:90%
over the side of the bed?

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.275 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: I do not.

00:16:49.275 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:90%
No, not typically.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.679 align:middle line:84%
There might be something
under my bed.

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.548 align:middle line:84%
See, so you still
have that little--

00:16:55.548 --> 00:16:56.983 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, you know,
when you're asleep you're

00:16:56.983 --> 00:16:58.918 align:middle line:90%
like okay, what can happen?

00:16:58.918 --> 00:17:02.288 align:middle line:84%
I've had spirits come to my
room, but there's a rule I have

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:05.692 align:middle line:84%
and the guardians know this,
that if they want to talk

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.527 align:middle line:84%
to me they don't come
when I'm sleeping.

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.262 align:middle line:84%
They must stay outside of
my room and we can talk

00:17:09.262 --> 00:17:10.062 align:middle line:90%
when I open the portal.

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:10.864 align:middle line:90%
That's it, period.

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:12.499 align:middle line:90%
And that's the rules I have.

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:14.801 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: In your second
books, Spirits of the Ouija,

00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:17.669 align:middle line:84%
what's the main message
you're trying to get across?

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:20.306 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: The message is this,
is that life does continue on,

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:22.509 align:middle line:84%
that the opposite
of love is fear,

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:25.979 align:middle line:84%
and the more we can find love
in our lives within ourselves,

00:17:25.979 --> 00:17:27.413 align:middle line:84%
the greater we'll
be in our lives,

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:30.483 align:middle line:84%
the more we can effect ourselves
and humanity and help others.

00:17:30.483 --> 00:17:35.021 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line of what
the book is about as well

00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:37.457 align:middle line:84%
as what the spirit guides on
the other side would like us

00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:39.859 align:middle line:84%
to know is that we have
these great potentials

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:42.762 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves and all we
need to do is activate those.

00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And how to do that, there's very
many different paths to do it,

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.603 align:middle line:84%
but they always tell me
that the path to the top,

00:17:50.603 --> 00:17:51.804 align:middle line:90%
there's many branches to it.

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So you could take many
different roads to get

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:84%
to the same end result,
and this is just one road.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.378 align:middle line:84%
But they want you to know
that there's a greatness

00:17:58.378 --> 00:18:01.114 align:middle line:84%
and grandness within ourselves
and I know I repeat myself

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:02.782 align:middle line:90%
when I say this, but I must

00:18:02.782 --> 00:18:06.419 align:middle line:84%
because I think we don't quite
fully grasp that at times.

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.489 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Does the Ouiga board
ever give you a glimpse

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:10.657 align:middle line:90%
of the future?

00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:11.758 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Well, it--

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.092 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Does it spell
out things like that?

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:15.328 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: It can and has and I
received letters from people

00:18:15.328 --> 00:18:17.697 align:middle line:84%
and emails that tell
me the same stuff.

00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:19.899 align:middle line:84%
I don't use it for
those reasons.

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:22.101 align:middle line:84%
I don't use it for
those purposes and one

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.637 align:middle line:84%
of the reasons why is because
it's not always accurate.

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:26.539 align:middle line:84%
Okay, it's kind of like
going into a psychic

00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:28.608 align:middle line:84%
and I love psychics,
don't get me wrong,

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.276 align:middle line:84%
but is anybody predicting
the future?

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.445 align:middle line:84%
It can change and
it could change

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.447 align:middle line:84%
as we evolve and
change our minds.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:35.782 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Events could change it?

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:37.984 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Yeah, events change
it, not just our own thoughts,

00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:40.653 align:middle line:84%
other events around us
change what's happening.

00:18:40.653 --> 00:18:42.889 align:middle line:84%
So to predict you
could say yeah,

00:18:42.889 --> 00:18:44.991 align:middle line:90%
generality, this could happen.

00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've had some of that
explained to me before.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.597 align:middle line:84%
I don't rely on that, I don't
use it for those reasons.

00:18:50.597 --> 00:18:52.966 align:middle line:84%
I use it, again, for
other kinds of purposes,

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:55.501 align:middle line:84%
more of a developmental purpose
than that because I don't want

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:58.404 align:middle line:84%
to rely on something outside
of me for the answers.

00:18:58.404 --> 00:19:02.175 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I mean, would it ever
say hurricane, category 5--

00:19:02.175 --> 00:19:02.842 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yes.

00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:03.509 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Coming soon.

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yes, it has.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.478 align:middle line:90%
It has to people before.

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:09.215 align:middle line:84%
And I've had some experience
with that too and I--

00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:11.251 align:middle line:84%
somebody just wrote to me
recently and told me about,

00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:13.987 align:middle line:84%
they knew that Mount Saint
Helen's was going to blow

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:16.356 align:middle line:84%
and it was-- this is
way after the fact,

00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:17.857 align:middle line:84%
but they heard it 10
years before it happened

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:20.593 align:middle line:84%
and even told what, where
it would happen and the name

00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:21.928 align:middle line:90%
of the lake, spirit lake,

00:19:21.928 --> 00:19:24.063 align:middle line:84%
and so there's some really
interesting stories like that

00:19:24.063 --> 00:19:27.166 align:middle line:84%
that you'll hear that, yeah,
things like that can happen.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:31.404 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What do you think the
other side is, and really is?

00:19:31.404 --> 00:19:35.575 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I happen to believe that
when this universe was created,

00:19:35.575 --> 00:19:37.543 align:middle line:84%
or the multi-verses
were created--

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:38.878 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Great way of saying it.

00:19:38.878 --> 00:19:42.949 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That it's just a natural
flow of what all this is.

00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:44.917 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people go
oh my god it's

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:47.553 align:middle line:84%
so supernatural,
it's so paranormal.

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:49.289 align:middle line:90%
I think it's very normal.

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:55.061 align:middle line:84%
I think that the mere fact that
we're here today talking is

00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:57.463 align:middle line:84%
as easy as what's on
the other side as well.

00:19:57.463 --> 00:20:00.833 align:middle line:84%
I think it's all encompassing,
it's all part of the same thing.

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.035 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts on that?

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:04.203 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: I- I very much
believe what you believe

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.271 align:middle line:90%
on the same level.

00:20:05.271 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a multi-verse
of different energies

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.877 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it's all
part of the matrix,

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.712 align:middle line:90%
and it's all the same source.

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.447 align:middle line:84%
And just because we can't
see some of the colors

00:20:14.447 --> 00:20:16.416 align:middle line:84%
in our spectrum, doesn't
mean it's the same thing.

00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:17.717 align:middle line:90%
That's not paranormal.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:20.620 align:middle line:84%
It's just we don't have the
ability within our makeup

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.357 align:middle line:84%
of our body, the mechanisms
within to see those spectrums

00:20:24.357 --> 00:20:26.192 align:middle line:90%
but yet they still exist.

00:20:26.192 --> 00:20:27.427 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with spirits
and ghosts,

00:20:27.427 --> 00:20:28.795 align:middle line:84%
that's why some people
do see them.

00:20:28.795 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I will see them too
occasionally,

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.398 align:middle line:84%
depending on if everything's
aligned correctly

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:34.801 align:middle line:84%
with the energy and the
mind and the heart and all

00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:35.968 align:middle line:90%
of that, they're there.

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:37.203 align:middle line:90%
They're here with us.

00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:40.807 align:middle line:84%
It's like a parallel
existence of the same source,

00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:44.010 align:middle line:84%
of the same matrix, we just
can't necessarily phantom

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.878 align:middle line:84%
that we're used to
linear concept

00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:48.781 align:middle line:84%
and this is not a
linear concept at all.

00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It's everything is happening
now and they tell me that.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.252 align:middle line:84%
They always say,
everything is right now.

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:55.021 align:middle line:84%
They tell me now until,
and I don't want--

00:20:55.021 --> 00:20:56.656 align:middle line:84%
I'm tired of hearing the
now is what I tell them.

00:20:56.656 --> 00:20:57.924 align:middle line:90%
They say, it's now.

00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.225 align:middle line:90%
Everything you do is right now.

00:20:59.225 --> 00:21:00.426 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right now.

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:01.828 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Right, and you can
effect great change now.

00:21:01.828 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Don't say tomorrow, it's
never going to come.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.598 align:middle line:84%
Don't say yesterday,
it's already happened.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:07.266 align:middle line:90%
It's now. Yesterday is now.

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.534 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow is now.

00:21:08.534 --> 00:21:10.536 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a hard
thing for us to phantom

00:21:10.536 --> 00:21:13.539 align:middle line:84%
because we want time,
we want that continuum,

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:15.742 align:middle line:84%
which is not necessarily
how it works.

00:21:15.742 --> 00:21:19.012 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You've used the Oiuja
board for self-development.

00:21:19.012 --> 00:21:20.313 align:middle line:90%
Tell me how that works.

00:21:20.313 --> 00:21:21.614 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Great.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:24.016 align:middle line:84%
Well I used it to, I'll
ask the questions, this--

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.651 align:middle line:84%
okay, let me start
from the beginning.

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:28.021 align:middle line:84%
So I'll have somebody come over
who works the board with me,

00:21:28.021 --> 00:21:30.323 align:middle line:84%
an operator I call them,
and maybe participants

00:21:30.323 --> 00:21:31.524 align:middle line:90%
that want to be sitters.

00:21:31.524 --> 00:21:32.725 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Okay.

00:21:32.725 --> 00:21:34.093 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Okay, and they
want to hear the session,

00:21:34.093 --> 00:21:36.262 align:middle line:84%
and what we'll do is we'll say
okay, we're going to open it

00:21:36.262 --> 00:21:38.664 align:middle line:84%
up to a message you have
for any of us in the room.

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:40.299 align:middle line:84%
So the guides come in
and they have a message.

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:44.003 align:middle line:84%
It might be something like,
for example, a friend came over

00:21:44.003 --> 00:21:48.875 align:middle line:84%
and she was wanting to make
contact with her deceased father

00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:51.244 align:middle line:84%
and immediately the
spirits come through

00:21:51.244 --> 00:21:52.412 align:middle line:84%
and said he wants
to talk to her.

00:21:52.412 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And when he came
through it was--

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.315 align:middle line:84%
he said, I want to let you
know that it's time now

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:90%
for you to live your life.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.386 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about so-in-so,
and he goes right into names,

00:22:00.386 --> 00:22:02.388 align:middle line:84%
as if he's part of her life
right now and he's been dead

00:22:02.388 --> 00:22:03.756 align:middle line:90%
for quite a few years.

00:22:03.756 --> 00:22:05.725 align:middle line:84%
So-in-so this person and this
person does things this way

00:22:05.725 --> 00:22:07.894 align:middle line:84%
and you really need to
look, to focus on yourself.

00:22:07.894 --> 00:22:08.995 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and this
is how you use it.

00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:11.798 align:middle line:84%
You use it not to--
okay, so you're dead.

00:22:11.798 --> 00:22:13.032 align:middle line:84%
What are you feeling
and all this stuff.

00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:15.234 align:middle line:84%
It's more about how
can we work together

00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:16.869 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
happens to ourselves

00:22:16.869 --> 00:22:18.504 align:middle line:84%
as we're alive and
as we're dead?

00:22:18.504 --> 00:22:20.473 align:middle line:84%
Is this like a mutual
conversation,

00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:22.575 align:middle line:84%
so what we do is we'll
have conversations.

00:22:22.575 --> 00:22:24.944 align:middle line:84%
Our hands will stay on the
plan chip [phonetic] like this.

00:22:24.944 --> 00:22:26.279 align:middle line:90%
It'll move.

00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:28.581 align:middle line:84%
We'll be talking in a side
conversation to the gal who came

00:22:28.581 --> 00:22:30.383 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to contact
her father.

00:22:30.383 --> 00:22:33.152 align:middle line:84%
I might say okay, now talk to
him as if he's here in the room.

00:22:33.152 --> 00:22:34.754 align:middle line:84%
And we keep our hands on
the planchettes and then

00:22:34.754 --> 00:22:36.889 align:middle line:84%
that spirit will be there
as part of the conversation

00:22:36.889 --> 00:22:39.192 align:middle line:84%
and we'll say well, have
you thought about this?

00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:42.428 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you think about
right now pursuing this dream

00:22:42.428 --> 00:22:43.262 align:middle line:90%
of yours?

00:22:43.262 --> 00:22:44.263 align:middle line:90%
You've been wanting to pursue.

00:22:44.263 --> 00:22:45.865 align:middle line:90%
Why are you waiting so long?

00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:90%
They never tell us what to do.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.434 align:middle line:90%
They'll give us questions.

00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:49.669 align:middle line:90%
Why are you waiting so long?

00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:52.171 align:middle line:84%
Why have you not activated
that within yourself?

00:22:52.171 --> 00:22:53.639 align:middle line:90%
What's holding you back?

00:22:53.639 --> 00:22:55.408 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll become
the moderator I guess

00:22:55.408 --> 00:22:58.077 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say so, so in so,
what's holding you back.

00:22:58.077 --> 00:23:01.147 align:middle line:84%
Well, because I haven't
felt the confidence.

00:23:01.147 --> 00:23:02.381 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say okay.

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:04.317 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't feel the
confidence well tell me what

00:23:04.317 --> 00:23:04.984 align:middle line:90%
that's about?

00:23:04.984 --> 00:23:05.618 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:23:05.618 --> 00:23:06.385 align:middle line:90%
What's that like?

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:07.753 align:middle line:90%
What does that feel like?

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:09.722 align:middle line:84%
And then the spirit will talk
too and then we'll all talk.

00:23:09.722 --> 00:23:12.191 align:middle line:84%
It's all of us working
together really and not one

00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:13.693 align:middle line:84%
of us having more of
a say than the other,

00:23:13.693 --> 00:23:16.629 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately it comes
back to the person whose--

00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:19.065 align:middle line:84%
who the message is
for to integrate it

00:23:19.065 --> 00:23:21.033 align:middle line:90%
and say okay, I understand.

00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I really need to go ahead
and go after this career

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.338 align:middle line:90%
that I'm wanting to do.

00:23:25.338 --> 00:23:26.672 align:middle line:90%
I know I can do it.

00:23:26.672 --> 00:23:28.508 align:middle line:90%
So he's right.

00:23:28.508 --> 00:23:29.909 align:middle line:90%
Why am I not doing it?

00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:32.111 align:middle line:84%
And then when you have somebody
like your father talking to you

00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:35.047 align:middle line:84%
who has a very positive
influence for this woman,

00:23:35.047 --> 00:23:37.416 align:middle line:90%
it's hard not to listen to that

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.819 align:middle line:84%
when he's using the same words
he used when he was alive

00:23:39.819 --> 00:23:45.358 align:middle line:84%
and the same tone and the same
comfortness that makes her want

00:23:45.358 --> 00:23:46.726 align:middle line:90%
to go wow, thank you, dad.

00:23:46.726 --> 00:23:47.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, thank you
for being there.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.663 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How do you also know
though that the messages

00:23:50.663 --> 00:23:52.865 align:middle line:90%
that come through aren't coming

00:23:52.865 --> 00:23:55.902 align:middle line:84%
from your very deep
subconscious,

00:23:55.902 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:90%
that it's really you?

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:00.106 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Right, the question is
ideomotor [phonetic] skills,

00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:84%
does it come from
your subconscious?

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Is it my mind making it happen?

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.445 align:middle line:84%
You know, and look there's
no way to prove any of that

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:07.813 align:middle line:90%
to be honest with you.

00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:09.081 align:middle line:84%
Maybe until I die and come back
and talk on the Ouija board,

00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:10.850 align:middle line:90%
right, on the other side.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.285 align:middle line:90%
This is what I say.

00:24:12.285 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:90%
If we can effect great change

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.923 align:middle line:84%
and people are actually getting
something from these sessions

00:24:16.923 --> 00:24:19.258 align:middle line:84%
and there's some kind of
healing element to it and--

00:24:19.258 --> 00:24:20.826 align:middle line:90%
GN: That's all that matters.

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:22.228 align:middle line:90%
KD: That's all that matters.

00:24:22.228 --> 00:24:25.097 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so that's pretty cool if
I can get my higher self to say

00:24:25.097 --> 00:24:27.433 align:middle line:84%
such poignant stuff like
that with the other person

00:24:27.433 --> 00:24:29.235 align:middle line:84%
and we're not fighting
for driver's control

00:24:29.235 --> 00:24:32.138 align:middle line:84%
over the planchette, you
know, nobody's pushing it.

00:24:32.138 --> 00:24:34.674 align:middle line:84%
You know, the flow of
it, the energy change,

00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:36.475 align:middle line:84%
when you're in the room
and how I watch this person

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:40.379 align:middle line:84%
or even myself getting the
message, that the change,

00:24:40.379 --> 00:24:44.383 align:middle line:84%
the change that goes over the
continence, the body language,

00:24:44.383 --> 00:24:46.819 align:middle line:84%
how that shifts, it's
like you can't help

00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:51.924 align:middle line:84%
but say this is something
magical, mysterious, personable,

00:24:51.924 --> 00:24:53.359 align:middle line:90%
real that's happening here.

00:24:53.359 --> 00:24:57.196 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, I
believe I'm not doing that

00:24:57.196 --> 00:24:58.864 align:middle line:84%
but I do know I've
spoken to my higher self.

00:24:58.864 --> 00:25:01.867 align:middle line:84%
It's helped me and others before
as well, that that process

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:04.637 align:middle line:90%
and that ability is there.

00:25:04.637 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:84%
So I just say as long as it's
a helpful thing, I'm not going

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.277 align:middle line:84%
to worry so much always where
it's coming from, right,

00:25:11.277 --> 00:25:13.245 align:middle line:84%
although I believe we're all
connected to the same source

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:15.581 align:middle line:84%
so it's really hard
to separate all that,

00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:17.583 align:middle line:84%
really when you're
working on this level.

00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:18.684 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And of course let's go

00:25:18.684 --> 00:25:21.387 align:middle line:84%
to a final call here
for Karan Dahlman.

00:25:21.387 --> 00:25:21.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Sean: Hi, Karen.

00:25:21.954 --> 00:25:23.289 align:middle line:90%
This is Sean.

00:25:23.289 --> 00:25:25.658 align:middle line:84%
I was curious how people can
get rid of evil around them.

00:25:25.658 --> 00:25:27.393 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Get rid of
evil around you.

00:25:27.393 --> 00:25:28.728 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you don't
believe in evil.

00:25:28.728 --> 00:25:29.929 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Right.

00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:32.398 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in evil as
a negative, as a entity.

00:25:32.398 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I believe in evil
in human behavior

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.203 align:middle line:84%
and people do horrific things,
which is evil in itself.

00:25:37.203 --> 00:25:39.639 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming he's speaking
more on the spiritual level

00:25:39.639 --> 00:25:40.473 align:middle line:90%
because we are after all--

00:25:40.473 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Absolutely I would think.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.942 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Spirit side.

00:25:42.942 --> 00:25:46.379 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so in that sense you know
you don't want to use any kind

00:25:46.379 --> 00:25:48.648 align:middle line:84%
of tool that takes you to the
other side, the other world,

00:25:48.648 --> 00:25:50.349 align:middle line:84%
the other realms if
you're not prepared

00:25:50.349 --> 00:25:53.753 align:middle line:84%
for that meaning it's not-- this
is not a toy, it's not a game,

00:25:53.753 --> 00:25:55.121 align:middle line:84%
it's not for anybody
that's weak minded.

00:25:55.121 --> 00:25:59.158 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be-- I don't
want to make a judgment call,

00:25:59.158 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
but feeling intimidated by
it and feeling fearful of it,

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.531 align:middle line:90%
because fear breeds fear

00:26:05.531 --> 00:26:07.033 align:middle line:84%
and fear again is
the opposite of love.

00:26:07.033 --> 00:26:09.602 align:middle line:84%
And so fear is the
absence also of light.

00:26:09.602 --> 00:26:13.139 align:middle line:84%
So if you feel like there's
a negative energy force,

00:26:13.139 --> 00:26:15.241 align:middle line:84%
let's just say it that way,
around you that you want

00:26:15.241 --> 00:26:17.343 align:middle line:84%
to call evil, I would say
there's some, you know,

00:26:17.343 --> 00:26:18.778 align:middle line:84%
you really need to
protect yourself.

00:26:18.778 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:84%
You need to get back into
your power of your center

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.783 align:middle line:84%
of who you are, not be
messing with this stuff,

00:26:23.783 --> 00:26:26.452 align:middle line:84%
but do some real inner
soul searching work.

00:26:26.452 --> 00:26:29.655 align:middle line:84%
Look at who you are, who
you're hanging out with,

00:26:29.655 --> 00:26:32.258 align:middle line:84%
what kind of environment
you're in, are you taking a lot

00:26:32.258 --> 00:26:34.527 align:middle line:84%
of weird substances, I
mean, what are you doing

00:26:34.527 --> 00:26:36.562 align:middle line:84%
to keep your integrity
here in terms

00:26:36.562 --> 00:26:38.431 align:middle line:90%
of being spiritually centered.

00:26:38.431 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: The reason why I
cancelled my Ouija board show

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.437 align:middle line:84%
on Coast to Coast, on
the national radio show,

00:26:44.437 --> 00:26:48.674 align:middle line:84%
was not because I'm particularly
afraid of the board.

00:26:48.674 --> 00:26:52.178 align:middle line:84%
It's all the other
people who are out there

00:26:52.178 --> 00:26:56.349 align:middle line:84%
that could have opened up
portals knowing it or not,

00:26:56.349 --> 00:26:59.085 align:middle line:84%
and so what I tried to
do was protect them.

00:26:59.085 --> 00:27:00.186 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: You thought
they might go out

00:27:00.186 --> 00:27:01.554 align:middle line:84%
and buy Ouija boards
and start using them?

00:27:01.554 --> 00:27:03.989 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And start using them
in a bad way or, you know,

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:07.893 align:middle line:84%
in a way that they're not
prepared for or ready because,

00:27:07.893 --> 00:27:10.529 align:middle line:84%
you know, whether
you sit and pray,

00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:15.167 align:middle line:84%
whether you use the Ouija board,
whether you light a candle

00:27:15.167 --> 00:27:18.104 align:middle line:90%
and try to conjure up the devil,

00:27:18.104 --> 00:27:20.039 align:middle line:84%
people do things
in different ways.

00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:24.143 align:middle line:84%
But I think when you reach deep
within yourself and then you try

00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:27.146 align:middle line:84%
to reach all these other
things, things can happen.

00:27:27.146 --> 00:27:29.415 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
prepared for it,

00:27:29.415 --> 00:27:31.751 align:middle line:84%
you could really do
some serious harm.

00:27:31.751 --> 00:27:32.618 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yeah, and so you saw--

00:27:32.618 --> 00:27:33.686 align:middle line:90%
what I like about this is

00:27:33.686 --> 00:27:36.155 align:middle line:84%
that you saw the
seriousness of this tool.

00:27:36.155 --> 00:27:37.723 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Absolutely,
it's not a joke to me.

00:27:37.723 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: It's not a joke.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:39.425 align:middle line:90%
It's not a game.

00:27:39.425 --> 00:27:41.494 align:middle line:84%
And that takes responsibility
with it.

00:27:41.494 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:84%
As I told you when I saw this
tool could be used for somebody

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:46.465 align:middle line:84%
to have-- effect great
healing with this board

00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:48.267 align:middle line:84%
and they had been carrying
on their back and it heavy

00:27:48.267 --> 00:27:50.836 align:middle line:84%
on their chest and their hearts
because the death of her sister,

00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:51.837 align:middle line:90%
horrific death of her sister.

00:27:51.837 --> 00:27:53.739 align:middle line:84%
It's that kind of
responsibility.

00:27:53.739 --> 00:27:56.842 align:middle line:84%
So in your mind, in your
heart that's what you need

00:27:56.842 --> 00:27:58.177 align:middle line:90%
to do and that makes sense.

00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So I would-- I value
that on that level

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.249 align:middle line:84%
because you know what, you
are out there nationally

00:28:03.249 --> 00:28:04.817 align:middle line:90%
and you have a right to--

00:28:04.817 --> 00:28:06.986 align:middle line:84%
a responsibility
with the information

00:28:06.986 --> 00:28:08.888 align:middle line:90%
that you're sharing, right.

00:28:08.888 --> 00:28:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And so do I and so I say don't
use this tool unless it's

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.159 align:middle line:90%
calling you to use it.

00:28:13.159 --> 00:28:16.762 align:middle line:84%
And only use it under those
auspices of using it correctly

00:28:16.762 --> 00:28:20.065 align:middle line:84%
and using it for a developmental
tool to help yourself grow

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:24.537 align:middle line:84%
or to find some kind of releaser
or closure to a death, period.

00:28:24.537 --> 00:28:27.072 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So people tell me that
if you try to get rid of these,

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:30.376 align:middle line:84%
if you try to burn
them, they won't burn.

00:28:30.376 --> 00:28:31.577 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever hear that?

00:28:31.577 --> 00:28:32.745 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: I do, but you know,

00:28:32.745 --> 00:28:34.947 align:middle line:84%
you probably know
what I'm going to say.

00:28:34.947 --> 00:28:37.683 align:middle line:84%
Don't give your power
to an outside source.

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:39.518 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Let's light them all now.

00:28:39.518 --> 00:28:40.553 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: No.

00:28:40.553 --> 00:28:41.687 align:middle line:84%
These are-- I have
some old ones here.

00:28:41.687 --> 00:28:42.822 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Collector's items, huh.

00:28:42.822 --> 00:28:45.191 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Yeah, these are
collector's items here.

00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:48.527 align:middle line:84%
No, look. To me these
are just boards,

00:28:48.527 --> 00:28:49.829 align:middle line:90%
heavy boards but they're boards.

00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:50.596 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Hold one up.

00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:51.597 align:middle line:90%
Hold up your favorite one.

00:28:51.597 --> 00:28:52.431 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Yeah, let's
get an older one.

00:28:52.431 --> 00:28:54.033 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of favorites here.

00:28:54.033 --> 00:28:55.467 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Hold it straight
up for the camera.

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.503 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: This one's from
the '20s and '30s.

00:28:57.503 --> 00:29:00.105 align:middle line:84%
This one even has the
directions on the back.

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:01.207 align:middle line:90%
This is-- I like them all.

00:29:01.207 --> 00:29:02.441 align:middle line:90%

00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:03.509 align:middle line:90%

00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:04.543 align:middle line:90%
You can see it better.

00:29:04.543 --> 00:29:06.545 align:middle line:84%
It's just, you know,
it's just a board.

00:29:06.545 --> 00:29:08.614 align:middle line:90%
So I wouldn't burn them.

00:29:08.614 --> 00:29:10.015 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to burn them.

00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:12.084 align:middle line:84%
You know, hey, there's people
out there that collect these.

00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:13.953 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of them and
there's quite a few that do.

00:29:13.953 --> 00:29:15.921 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got some old
one that we like, heck,

00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:17.289 align:middle line:90%
I might want to buy it.

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:18.958 align:middle line:84%

the board of the planchette.

00:29:18.958 --> 00:29:20.759 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: To me, myself.

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:21.961 align:middle line:90%
That's what's more important.

00:29:21.961 --> 00:29:23.162 align:middle line:90%

00:29:23.162 --> 00:29:25.598 align:middle line:84%

That's what's more important.

00:29:27.433 --> 00:29:29.468 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't
need a planchette.

00:29:29.468 --> 00:29:30.703 align:middle line:90%
I don't need a board.

00:29:30.703 --> 00:29:33.205 align:middle line:84%
I've been known to-- people
want to do Ouija board,

00:29:33.205 --> 00:29:35.241 align:middle line:84%
I've been known to
open up a paper sack,

00:29:35.241 --> 00:29:36.141 align:middle line:90%
write on it the letters.

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:37.209 align:middle line:90%

over a Pyrex glass

00:29:38.544 --> 00:29:41.113 align:middle line:84%
