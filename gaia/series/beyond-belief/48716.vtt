I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to

>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%

>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.630 align:middle line:10%
You know, on this program,
"Beyond Belief" and our radio

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:10%
show "Coast to
Coast AM," we talk

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:10%
a lot about extraterrestrial
life, creatures

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:10%
from the unknown,
other dimensions.

Tonight, Michael
Carter, the Reverend,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:90%
joins us, an expert on ufology.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Michael, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REV. MICHAEL JS
CARTER: It's my pleasure.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Always a
pleasure to see you.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.831 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: It's my pleasure too.

00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did a reverend
get involved in ufology?

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Oh, boy.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a good question.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it
happened like this.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:84%
In December 28, 1989, I
went to see the pyramids

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:90%
at Chichen Itza and Tulum.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ah ha.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: Coming back,
I went to-- a friend

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:10%
of mine had a party.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
go, but I wanted

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.200 align:middle line:84%
to show off my
tan, the whole bit.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:90%
It was 85 there.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:90%
It was freezing in New York.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.140 align:middle line:90%
And I went to his party.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I stayed for about an hour.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:10%
I may have had a glass of
punch or something, and I left.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle line:10%
When I got back home that
night-- and even now,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why I got up.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:10%
But I got up and I looked,
at the edge of my bed

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:10%
was this individual with
the pear-shaped head,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:10%
with the wrap-around eyes.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.389 align:middle line:90%
Now, she wasn't grey.

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wasn't one of
those little people.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: It was a chalk,
like a chalk color,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:90%
had an aluminum foil jumpsuit.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And I thought my heart was
going to pump out of my chest.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:90%
I was frightened.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you think you
were dreaming, hallucinating?

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.738 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: No, I knew I wasn't
because everything in my room

00:01:57.738 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:90%
was the same.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like any distortion.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:84%
But I just felt like-- I was
just frightened, pure fear.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I pulled the cover
up over my head,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
and I felt this-- I
felt a temperature

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:84%
change, like maybe
I was outside.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And I heard this whooosh
sound in my ears.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And when I pulled the cover
down, I was back in my room

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
My wife at the time
did not wake up.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And it got me a
quest, and I read

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:84%
everything I could
read on the subject.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I was already moving
away from the religion

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:84%
of my childhood as a Baptist,
that form of Christianity,

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and I started just
reading everything.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I read Barry
Downing's book--

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.399 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: --who's a friend
and colleague of mine,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:10%
and it really got me interested
in-- well, wait a minute here.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:10%
Why don't we really
take a look at this?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.579 align:middle line:10%
Went to a psychiatrist
to make sure--

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Just to check you out.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.828 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Right, right.

00:02:53.828 --> 00:02:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And some could say it was
good news, it was bad.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Jean Mundy.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Went to Bud, the
late Bud Hopkins--

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bud Hopkins?

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: --to regress me--

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's
missed, by the way.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: --and also do-- oh.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, he's missed.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.781 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: I know, I know.

00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.274 align:middle line:10%
They just had an
exhibit in New York

00:03:07.274 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:10%
over the weekend-- there
was something on Facebook--

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.714 align:middle line:10%
with Peter Robbins.

00:03:10.714 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A little
tribute for him.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.940 align:middle line:10%
But that's how I got started.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:90%
That's how I got started.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
closeted about it.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:90%
I would talk about research.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Barry gave me the idea,
Dr. Barry Downing,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and I ran with it,
but I would never

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
talk about my own experiences
until I wrote this book.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
This was my master's thesis,
without my own experiences.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did you
decide to go public?

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Well, the publisher--
the first publisher,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.082 align:middle line:84%
little mom and pop
publisher out in Arizona,

00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:84%
she said, Michael,
it's compelling.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.586 align:middle line:90%
You must tell this story.

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:84%
This is what people
want to hear.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we know about the ancient
text and fine, do that.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:90%
But why not tell your story?

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I just started
putting it on my resume.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I did a consulting job a few
weeks ago, and they snickered.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:90%
They chuckled when I got there.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.499 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people came up
afterwards and said, well,

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:90%
tell me about that.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, because
you're serious about this.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: I don't have
delusions of grandeur.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:90%
I get up in the morning.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm wrestling with what it means
to be a human being on planet

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Earth and that kind of thing.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
But it did happen, and it's
happening more and more.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm more interested in,
though, not propulsion systems.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And well, I think
those are fascinating,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.799 align:middle line:90%
and maybe my head's not there.

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that kind of mind.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But I'm more interested in
how will we become more human.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
How will we navigate and
negotiate with one another

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:90%
after these experiences?

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And interact.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: More the
spiritual-- it's

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.985 align:middle line:84%
a hackneyed term-- but
more the spiritual.

00:04:56.985 --> 00:05:00.640 align:middle line:84%
How will I look at you as
my fellow man and woman

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:84%
now that I've had
this experience?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
you were abducted?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: I don't.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't use the word.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I use the old 1950s-- I was a
contactee, the kind of George

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Adamski, that kind of thing,
or an experiencer, when

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.752 align:middle line:84%
John Mack was alive,
the late John Mack.

00:05:15.752 --> 00:05:16.710 align:middle line:90%
I look at it like that.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- under hypnosis
and what I remember,

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:90%
nothing was against my will.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:84%
But I still sleep
with the light on.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Last night, I kept the light
on until the last minute

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:90%
I was gonna go to sleep.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.730 align:middle line:90%
I was exhausted.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's just that--

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.094 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you afraid?

00:05:32.094 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Well, yeah,
but not of them.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:84%
More of just to wake
up in the middle

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:84%
of the night with my doors
locked and my windows shut

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.627 align:middle line:90%
and to see somebody in there.

00:05:40.627 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:90%
That, I think.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whoever
it might be, right?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.946 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Right.

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:90%
So that, and then I get over it.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's still there.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I sleep
with my light on.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, last
night no one came.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.101 align:middle line:84%
But it was just if to wake
up, and there's a being there,

00:05:57.101 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:90%
that'll--

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.516 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's jarring.

00:05:58.516 --> 00:05:59.886 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yes, that's the word.

00:05:59.886 --> 00:06:00.612 align:middle line:90%
It's jarring.

00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've got three kids.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
little ones, they

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:84%
think nothing but
running into the bedroom,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.565 align:middle line:84%
jumping up on daddy,
and daddy's asleep.

00:06:10.565 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I was producing
late night television shows.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:90%
And they stare right at you.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the first thing you
do is you open your eyes,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.755 align:middle line:84%
and you see these little brown
eyes looking down on you,

00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:23.505 align:middle line:90%
and it's jarring--

00:06:23.505 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: It's jarring.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.136 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --right away.

00:06:25.136 --> 00:06:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So I can only imagine
what you went through.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.985 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:27.985 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's not post
traumatic in that sense,

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:90%
but I still do.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are times when
I'm just so exhausted I do.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:90%
I can never say they harmed me.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I can say that--
and I work on this

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
with my meditation and
my own devotionals.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But I live my life, I
try to, less fearfully.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.087 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying you got to
have people from other planets

00:06:51.087 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:90%
to help you do that.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.670 align:middle line:84%
But I am saying that that
was-- I went from trauma--

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
my evolution went from
trauma to acceptance.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think is going on?

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:09.897 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: I feel, and from
just what they've shown me,

00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:90%
it's pictures.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.021 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
is ongoing for you?

00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:14.246 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yes, yes, yes.

00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:15.985 align:middle line:90%
This month I had a visitation--

00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another one?

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.278 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: --on the 5th, yeah.

00:07:18.278 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:10%


00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.760 align:middle line:10%
It's to help humanity go to
the next stage of evolution.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:90%
We've heard this.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:90%
We fight too much.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
We believe in too
much separateness.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're barbarians.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.543 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yes, yeah.

00:07:31.543 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:90%
You're Tea Party, I'm not.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Your lips are thicker, or
my hair is nap-- I mean,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:90%
it's going to destroy us.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it's basically
to have us go

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:84%
to the next step of
evolution to deal with fear.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the tremendous fear of
what is and who is different.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a diversity
consultant as well as

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:84%
a Unitarian
Universalist minister.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And I look at this as part
of my call, if you will.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.964 align:middle line:84%
There's diversity
in the universe.

00:08:02.964 --> 00:08:04.380 align:middle line:84%
These beings don't
all look alike.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of them look
like praying mantis.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.420 align:middle line:90%
I've seen reptilians.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the short
individual I told you about.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:84%
They look very different, but
we're still-- have to coexist.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds like
"Kumbaya," but it's not.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's so simple and
profound, but it's so difficult,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:90%
this belief in separateness.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So I feel, for the individuals
that have come to me,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.340 align:middle line:84%
because there are
people out there

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:84%
who've had traumatic
experiences.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are more-- there
are less-evolved human beings,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and there are less-evolved
off-world intelligences.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying
all of them want

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:90%
to come and hold our hands.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But for the ones
that I have been--

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They may
want to eat our hands.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.823 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Thank you.

00:08:42.823 --> 00:08:46.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.350 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned before,
Childhood's End, the book,

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Arthur C. Clarke.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.110 align:middle line:84%
That, as a species,
we have to grow up

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.890 align:middle line:84%
because we can
destroy ourselves.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.859 align:middle line:84%
Things can get very apocalyptic
very quickly on this planet.

00:09:02.859 --> 00:09:04.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you consider
yourself a messenger?

00:09:04.775 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: You know,
someone called me

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:84%
that just the other day, a
therapist friend of mine.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle line:84%
She said, "You're
like an ambassador."

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't think-- yeah, OK.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.890 align:middle line:90%
I've been called worse.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Messenger is good.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:90%
But there are many messengers.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.700 align:middle line:10%
And that's good, you know, so I
don't get some grandiose sense

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.130 align:middle line:10%
of myself, not that
I'm prone to that.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But being human,
like I'm special.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not special.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that this is
happening, that this is real.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:10%
And I could be wrong, and
it could all be otherwise,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:10%
I just don't believe that I am.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:10%
And so I just have
to tell my story.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm not saying people
have to believe it.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.010 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who have
been upset with me, about I'm

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.274 align:middle line:84%
taking away their
Jesus or their god,

00:09:53.274 --> 00:09:54.440 align:middle line:90%
and that's not my intention.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
not doing that.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: But I have a right--

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can see that.

00:09:59.145 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: --to speak my truth.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't fit, if it
doesn't resonate, that's OK.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.210 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to think
alike to love alike.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.029 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, you were
on "Coast to Coast"

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:10%
with me, tremendous response.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.820 align:middle line:84%
But you did have a small
handful of people who thought--

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Oh, they were angry.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you were
attacking religion.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.851 align:middle line:84%
You were attacking Jesus,
which you were not.

00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: I don't feel--

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were not.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: --that I was.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.358 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But the
mere fact that you

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:10%
talk about ETs and
that kind of existence,

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:10%
they get offended by that.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: They did, and they do.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I was telling you there was
a guy who wrote me yesterday,

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, wow, it took
you this long to write me.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.780 align:middle line:90%
But he said, "You make me sick."

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:84%
But he said, "I'm not a
Bible scholar," he said,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.526 align:middle line:84%
"but I'm a follower
of Jesus Christ."

00:10:49.526 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well, don't
you see the disconnect,

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.733 align:middle line:90%
the language you're using?

00:10:52.733 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't write that.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:10%
He just told me that
I was part of Satan,

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:10%
that I was making money,
which I'm not, on this,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:10%
and that he needed to
stand up against me.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:10%
And I said, "Look, I'm
sorry I made you sick.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:10%
That wasn't my intention.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:10%
But I'm not going to
debate with you this,"

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.711 align:middle line:10%
and I just said, "Happy Easter."

00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I've
been responding.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm past the point.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm 57 years old.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm past the point
of trying to get

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.510 align:middle line:84%
you to believe that
we are being visited.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
need this in your life.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.926 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: No, no, I
don't have the time.

00:11:21.926 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:84%
But I do try to not
respond in anger.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.400 align:middle line:90%
I do try to walk my talk.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And from these
beings, I have gotten

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that this is really
about love and fear.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And if there's going
to be love, it's

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.801 align:middle line:84%
not that you don't
have fear, but you

00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
have to start working
through those fears.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's simply
what I try to do.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.059 align:middle line:84%
Just very quickly, I spoke
at a Presbyterian church

00:11:47.059 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:90%
the other day, Wednesday.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine asked me
to do a Lenten service.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Nothing to do with ETs I don't
talk about ETs from the pulpit.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder
what they'd react to.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Well, well,
this guy came up to me

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "You're a
Unitarian Universalist."

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Yeah."

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:84%
He said, "You don't
believe in Lent."

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.120 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, some of us
do and some of us don't."

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well, I
don't understand that."

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, we have
atheists in my church

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:84%
on Sunday, which is kind
of an oxymoron, but we do.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:90%
We have Buddhists.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
We have people who don't
know and don't care.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we just try
to-- what brings us together."

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.370 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't get past it.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well, I agree
with the love part."

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Then why are
we having this conversation?

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.840 align:middle line:90%
You want to talk about theology.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to argue
theology with you."

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But even there, we
weren't talking about ETs,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.592 align:middle line:84%
but because I don't believe
the same way he does,

00:12:37.592 --> 00:12:38.675 align:middle line:90%
he was very uncomfortable.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:39.841 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And would not open.

00:12:39.841 --> 00:12:41.836 align:middle line:90%
They're not open to that.

00:12:41.836 --> 00:12:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: His minister was,
because she asked me to come.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "If you have
an issue, take it to her.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.060 align:middle line:84%
But I have the
prerogative to be here."

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
But it was just
this separateness.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.132 align:middle line:84%
You don't think like I think,
so therefore you are the other.

00:12:54.132 --> 00:12:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It can get dangerous
after a while.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have long
suspected, Michael,

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:84%
that ET visitations
were confused

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:90%
for angelic visitations.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Barry Downing believes
the same thing.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.892 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:13:06.892 --> 00:13:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: I agree with Barry.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.350 align:middle line:90%
We differ on small points.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Barry and I differ on-- I
say, "Barry, what kind of god

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.080 align:middle line:84%
would kill the firstborn
of every child in Egypt?

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.431 align:middle line:90%
I have a problem with that."

00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Well, Michael,
you want your god

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:84%
to be warm and fuzzy, and
maybe god's not like that."

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.890 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:26.599 align:middle line:90%
But I just can't.

00:13:26.599 --> 00:13:28.181 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's difficult
to comprehend.

00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: As the young folks
say, I can't roll with that.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
these beings--

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:90%
they didn't have wings.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:36.914 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:36.914 --> 00:13:37.705 align:middle line:90%
They weren't solid.

00:13:37.705 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:90%
They ate.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:90%
And probably with the--

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:41.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Baked bread.

00:13:41.845 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: --technology, yes.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.570 align:middle line:10%
And so probably
with the technology,

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:10%
which is very awe-inspiring,
of course, if you're

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:10%
5,000 years ago or around the
time of Jesus of Nazareth,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:10%
you would probably say
these people are god-like.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:10%
These are gods.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:10%
And if you have
someone like Yahweh,

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:10%
who's not going to
tell you I'm not a god.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I am your god, and you
need to be circumcised,

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and you need not to
associate with the goyim,

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:90%
the unclean ones.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.215 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to say to that?

00:14:13.215 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I believe.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.464 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm not saying
there is no first cause,

00:14:20.464 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:90%
call it what you will.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're not
saying there is not a god.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.425 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: That's
what I'm saying.

00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Call it what you will.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:31.890 align:middle line:84%
But I am saying that
there's more proof

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial life-- we
see all these ships in the sky,

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.074 align:middle line:84%
there was a ship
flying over Ukraine,

00:14:37.074 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
than there is of the
existence of Jesus.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.079 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we know Jesus was there.

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying he wasn't.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
But here you have people
with their iPhones.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:90%
You have the military.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, it's right there.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:90%
What more do you want?

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.730 align:middle line:90%
So that's where I'm coming from.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:84%
The Bible still means a lot
to me, the example of Jesus,

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:84%
the Qur'an, I have
all the Dhammapada.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:84%
There are rich
spiritual truths there.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I try to live my life that way
and how I want to be treated.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's beyond religion, and
religion can get in the way.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what's happening now.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.140 align:middle line:90%
And it can be dangerous.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.145 align:middle line:84%
It can be very dangerous, all in
the name of, I believe in Jesus

00:15:22.145 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Christ and you don't.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wars are
fought over that.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: And will continue to.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think these beings are
saying you got to grow up.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:90%
You've got to grow up.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.980 align:middle line:84%
We sent these beings to you to
help you go beyond barbarism.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And you've taken them,
and you've made them gods.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.100 align:middle line:90%
You've made us gods.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us the
premise of your book.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Basically that
the monotheistic religions,

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Judaism, Christianity, and
Islam, were probably-- well,

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.370 align:middle line:84%
originated with these
extraterrestrial beings

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
because they are found
in all three books.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.010 align:middle line:90%
And I talk about that.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I talk about my own personal
experiences, how I evolved.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And how we can you
use those things,

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:84%
if we want to, in
the 21st century

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.530 align:middle line:84%
to get over this
belief and separatism.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:84%
We can destroy this planet now
with this belief of separatism.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We sure can.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:10%
Do you think you can help
bring people together?

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Most definitely.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:10%
As I said, with your
show, after your show,

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:10%
my book went to
number 1 on amazon.com

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:10%
under the topic of UFOs.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:10%
So you people are listening.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:10%
You give us the forum.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And so out of 100 calls,
let's say, 80% of those calls

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.320 align:middle line:84%
were people who were
congratulatory and people who

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:84%
may not even believe
the same way.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:90%
But they were open to it.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
how the world changes,

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:90%
one person at a time.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:10%
Shows like this, shows
like your radio show,

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:10%
people's radio shows I've been
on, and having the courage.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:10%
You know, I'm on here now.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:10%
You and I have been
on "Ancient Aliens."

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:10%
Probably 25, 30
years ago, we don't

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:10%
know if there would have been an
"Ancient Aliens" because people

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:10%
was close-minded.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Now it's going into
its seventh season.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.989 align:middle line:90%
People are intrigued and--

00:17:17.989 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't
get enough of it.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.071 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: You can't
get enough of it.

00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:25.099 align:middle line:84%
And what did the visitor
tell Philip Corso

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:84%
before he died when he asked the
visitor-- the author of The Day

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:84%
after Roswell-- what
are you offering us?

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.404 align:middle line:84%
And the being said, "A new
world if you can take it."

00:17:32.404 --> 00:17:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you can take it.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: If you can take it.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.996 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people can take it?

00:17:35.996 --> 00:17:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: We're
going to find out.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I think right now, a lot
of people can take it.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.298 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do governments
want us to take it?

00:17:41.298 --> 00:17:43.115 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: It may go beyond that.

00:17:43.115 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I can understand, on
an intellectual level,

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and just on an
intellectual level--

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.072 align:middle line:84%
and like an Apache friend
told me many years ago,

00:17:50.072 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Michael, the longest
journey you will ever take

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.620 align:middle line:90%
will be from here to here.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been
lying to folk.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.500 align:middle line:90%
People have been missing.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:90%
People have been killed.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about maybe
cures for some diseases

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:90%
that we have here.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.116 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about free energy.

00:18:09.116 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:90%
That takes a lot of--

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bingo.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: --money.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, that gets very dangerous
if you're talking about that.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:90%
So I can see why.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.230 align:middle line:90%
But the world is changing.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Who was it?

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Victor Hugo-- "Nothing
is as powerful as an idea

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.700 align:middle line:90%
whose time has come."

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:10%
And the time has come.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:10%
And so do we go
kicking and screaming?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:10%
Or do we say, you know what?

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:90%
It's scary.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:90%
It's change.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.750 align:middle line:90%
But we can do this.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:90%
We can do this.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:40.869 align:middle line:90%
And I think we can.

00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we see what's
happening in Ukraine.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:10%
Now there's more
dialogue, at least

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.560 align:middle line:10%
from what I'm hearing
on CNN and NPR

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.497 align:middle line:10%
with Putin, Mr. Putin,
and other governments,

00:18:52.497 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:10%
because that could have gotten
out of hand very quickly.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:10%
Still may.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: It still may,
but at least, you know,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:10%
so far there's
still time to talk,

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.765 align:middle line:10%
and as long as we can talk.

00:19:02.765 --> 00:19:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people--
I'm not the president.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:84%
I can criticize him,
which I do at times.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not running the country.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:90%
These are tough decisions.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:90%
But war is obsolete.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.380 align:middle line:90%
The price is too high.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.610 align:middle line:84%
It always was,
but it's too high.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And we can be more
creative than that.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do these
visitors want you to know?

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: They have told me
that I have-- I accepted this

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.970 align:middle line:90%
before I came here.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:84%
They told me that
they had watched me

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.330 align:middle line:90%
from the time I was a child.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:39.831 align:middle line:90%
And now--

00:19:39.831 --> 00:19:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Kierkegaard, what did he say?

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:84%
"Life is lived forward
but understood backwards."

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And that what I'm saying
now, to tell people

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.650 align:middle line:90%
that they are not here to harm.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.590 align:middle line:84%
They could have done
that if they wanted to.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.370 align:middle line:84%
They are here to take us to
our next phase of evolution

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.060 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And the tremendous enemy, to
them and to us, is our fear.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And also, with
this nuclear thing,

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.480 align:middle line:84%
we've got to
really, as they say,

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:90%
chill out on that because--

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some say they'll step
in and bail us out of that one.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I would hope.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.172 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah.

00:20:24.172 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, a friend of mine told
me hoping is not a process.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're still
waiting for a savior.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:84%
You're still waiting
for a savior.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's not let
them worry about us.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.080 align:middle line:90%
If they do that, that's fine.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.455 align:middle line:84%
But I'd hate to
get to the brink,

00:20:35.455 --> 00:20:36.640 align:middle line:90%
and then nothing happens.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.317 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:20:37.317 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oops.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: --we're barbecued.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where are they?

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.512 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:40.512 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's dangerous times.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: It's terrible.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:90%
It's terrible.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.644 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Moses comes down
from the Mount, his Ten

00:20:47.644 --> 00:20:48.185 align:middle line:90%
Commandments.

00:20:48.185 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Brother Moses.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.996 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's got his
white hair, that glow.

00:20:52.996 --> 00:20:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Yeah, he's
got radiation poisoning.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did God give it to him?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: I think
that Yahweh did,

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.340 align:middle line:84%
I think being around
all that energy.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:84%
The crucial thing about Moses is
that there's no Jewish religion

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.485 align:middle line:90%
until the Ten Commandments.

00:21:08.485 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: There's
no Jewish religion.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.686 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
Book of Leviticus,

00:21:11.686 --> 00:21:14.190 align:middle line:84%
we get other laws, how much
to charge for a slave even.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:84%
You see how that would
probably raise my dander.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But you know, how many
shekels to charge for slaves.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.810 align:middle line:90%
And I'm being facetious.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:84%
All civilizations
have had slavery.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.534 align:middle line:84%
My point being, though,
is that he comes down.

00:21:26.534 --> 00:21:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the
Ten Commandments

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.465 align:middle line:90%
were not for everyone.

00:21:29.465 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:90%
It was just for the Jews.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:84%
You didn't do this to
another Jewish person.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:33.533 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --for everybody.

00:21:33.533 --> 00:21:34.657 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:34.657 --> 00:21:36.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know, now they are.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But at that time,
you know, that's

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:84%
how Yahweh said you are my
people, and I am your God.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:90%
You are circumcised.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.127 align:middle line:90%
You don't intermarry.

00:21:45.127 --> 00:21:45.960 align:middle line:90%
This is what you do.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Honor the
Sabbath, all that.

00:21:47.505 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:84%
But you could go into
the land of Canaan

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and kill men,
women, and children.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.551 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:21:53.551 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:54.670 align:middle line:90%
That's all right.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.336 align:middle line:84%
But you don't do this
to the other Jews.

00:21:56.336 --> 00:21:58.040 align:middle line:90%
So now it's more universal.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:84%
But they're following
a pillar of cloud

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.660 align:middle line:84%
by day and a pillar
of fire by night.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a UFO.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:90%
It's in the sky.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
In the daytime, it
hides behind clouds,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.670 align:middle line:90%
or it comes out of the clouds.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.320 align:middle line:90%
In the day it glows.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.180 align:middle line:90%
It camps out.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:90%
They camp out underneath.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a little manna from
heaven or food is coming out.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:10%
Who knows what it was.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.626 align:middle line:10%
And then they pack up, and
they do this for 40 years.

00:22:24.626 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:10%
That is the very definition
of a UFO, you know?

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:90%
They're following it.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:90%
It's intelligent.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:90%
It stops, it starts.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It protects them.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Here's the beginnings
of the Jewish religion.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:36.468 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Parts the sea.

00:22:36.468 --> 00:22:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Thank you.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just thinking,
Barry, maybe you have a point.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it
just makes the Bible,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.040 align:middle line:84%
at least to me, it's many
things, much more palatable.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
suspend reason, even

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.749 align:middle line:84%
though these things I'm talking
about are beyond reason.

00:22:54.749 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing when
you look at biblical texts--

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Oh, my god,
it's right there.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.484 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and
compare it to what

00:22:59.484 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:84%
might be happening
with UFOs and things.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel's wheel, what
the heck was that?

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: It was a spaceship.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Josef Blumrich wrote a book.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:90%
You can Google it.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.930 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:90%
He was a NASA engineer.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.090 align:middle line:84%
He used the metrics
and the measurements

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:90%
that Ezekiel said that he saw.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And he was a NASA
engineer, and he puts it

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.610 align:middle line:84%
on the cover of his book,
The Spaceships of Ezekiel.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, Ray Charles can
see that it's right there.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's a new world
if we can take it.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we take it?

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: I think we can.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:90%
I got my money on that we can.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.060 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.335 align:middle line:84%
I get up in the morning,
and I'm excited about life.

00:23:37.335 --> 00:23:39.376 align:middle line:84%
Yes, things get me down,
and I have my own issues

00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:90%
and problems.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're human.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Thank you.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.029 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure, huh?

00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yes, yes.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:48.050 align:middle line:10%
But the more human I became,
the more authentic I became,

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:10%
when I learned to say I'm
sorry, I don't know, forgive me.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Coming up in the
Baptist tradition,

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:90%
I was told to be like Jesus.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.582 align:middle line:90%
But I need to be like me, right?

00:24:02.582 --> 00:24:04.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
the poet says--

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:90%
"This is me for that I came."

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:90%
I can use the tenets of Jesus.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I say I'm a follower of
the teachings of Jesus.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:84%
But this is my life, and
I have to be who I am.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.270 align:middle line:90%
And this is the Hero's Journey.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:24.520 align:middle line:10%
This is the Shero's Journey, and
Jesus had to go through it too.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:10%
And so to realize that who
I am, my divine heritage,

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.490 align:middle line:10%
if you will, like you
have it, like I have it.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.880 align:middle line:90%
And so it is the Hero's Journey.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you're
there, and I'm here.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:90%
But all this is within me.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.350 align:middle line:10%
But even back in
that time when he

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.287 align:middle line:10%
said that, people
were like, what?

00:24:43.287 --> 00:24:45.620 align:middle line:10%
What are you-- that's blas--
what are you talking about,

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.050 align:middle line:10%
Rev?

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Burn him at the stake.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.039 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Burn him, nail
him to a piece of wood.

00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's just get it done.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was Jesus a hybrid?

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: I think so.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Controversial.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Well, yes.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he says, "Look my
kingdom is not of this world."

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:90%
He says this in John.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.397 align:middle line:90%
His mom is human, but Abba--

00:25:07.397 --> 00:25:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doesn't conceive.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: --daddy's not.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:84%
What am I supposed
to make of that?

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.630 align:middle line:90%
Then you're not fully human.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:84%
It makes sense of
the miracle stories.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.600 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take away from
the message he brought.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.524 align:middle line:90%
But he's saying, "My kingdom."

00:25:21.524 --> 00:25:22.732 align:middle line:90%
He tells Pilate at the trial.

00:25:22.732 --> 00:25:24.444 align:middle line:90%
He says, "Look--"

00:25:24.444 --> 00:25:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Pilate says, "Aren't you
going to speak to me?

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to answer me?"

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.450 align:middle line:84%
OK? "You're not
going to answer me?

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.580 align:middle line:90%
I represent Rome."

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:90%
And Jesus says--

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can free you.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:33.785 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah.

00:25:33.785 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, Jesus says,
"You have no pow--"

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:90%
He says, "I have power over you.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.640 align:middle line:90%
I can put you to death."

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus says, "You
have no power over me

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:84%
unless it was given
to you from above."

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to, I
could-- he calls

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.297 align:middle line:84%
them legions-- I could have "12
legions of angels" come here,

00:25:47.297 --> 00:25:48.770 align:middle line:90%
and and this game is over.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, what more do we want?

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And also, all these characters
are in the Qur'an, Esau,

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:84%
which is Joshua, which
is Jesus, Miriam.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Gabriel's got the great job.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Every woman he meets
becomes pregnant.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:07.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a great job.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're older women,
but whether it's Sarah,

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Miriam, whether
it's John the Baptist's mom,

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Elizabeth.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.120 align:middle line:90%
Samson's mom doesn't get a name.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Women were below dirt in those
times in a patriarchal society.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.260 align:middle line:90%
But Manoah, we know his name.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.400 align:middle line:90%
They visit.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.540 align:middle line:90%
Gabriel comes.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:30.480 align:middle line:84%
The angels come, and
these superhuman men.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.370 align:middle line:84%
This god Yahweh, very
concerned with genetics

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:90%
and how pure everything is.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And so it started
to make sense to me

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:42.420 align:middle line:84%
that this is a captain
of some type of spaceship

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.680 align:middle line:90%
that needs anger management.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:84%
But he's sending messengers
and what have you.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when
Jesus comes, we

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:84%
could argue that
maybe he's talking

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
about a different god--
"this is my father,"

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:84%
because it's a different
god than Yahweh.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I'm
looking at, and I'm

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.910 align:middle line:90%
thinking it's right there.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And that these beings are
here, and they will come again.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:84%
But all of them are
not our best friends.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.300 align:middle line:90%
I will grant that.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want to
paint a broad brush

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:90%
and say that they're all bad.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Why do we do that
with each other?

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.130 align:middle line:90%
They're all bad, those people.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Those lazy people, you
know how those are.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I sometimes
think we're in,

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Michael-- Barry writes
this in his work--

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.856 align:middle line:84%
that we may be like
a prison planet.

00:27:30.856 --> 00:27:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Well, where
we just cast off that--

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where they
just cast off the losers

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.269 align:middle line:90%
of the universe--

00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:38.393 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: I don't think so.

00:27:38.393 --> 00:27:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --onto our planet.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Maybe
my ego's that big.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are
people-- James Baldwin said,

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.682 align:middle line:84%
"The world turns by the
love of a very few people."

00:27:46.682 --> 00:27:47.640 align:middle line:90%
And we don't hear that.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:84%
We hear the fear factor, and you
can control people with that.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:90%
But you and I aren't losers.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.140 align:middle line:90%
The people here aren't losers.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we
don't hear about it.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:84%
But there are
people out here who

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:08.500 align:middle line:84%
try to love, who are
about evolving and growth.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.396 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just tossing my hat
in on the side of those folk.

00:28:12.396 --> 00:28:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, if people
want more information on you,

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:15.920 align:middle line:90%
where do they go?

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.920 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: They can go
to michaeljscarter.com.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.590 align:middle line:10%
That's my website.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:10%
You can buy the book on Amazon.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.840 align:middle line:10%
It's Alien Scriptures,
Extraterrestrials

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.950 align:middle line:10%
in the Holy Bible.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.450 align:middle line:10%
Write me.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:10%
Let's keep the dialogue going.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I think the book is
well worth the read.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a quick read.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to
more conversations.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's controversial.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: I know, I know.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.350 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes truth
is, and I don't

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:42.760 align:middle line:90%
mean that in a grandiose way.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we need
to hear these things.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you still scared
about these visitations?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: You know what?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm not scared.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It's almost a mystery
of trememdous--

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You wake up.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.700 align:middle line:90%
You see something in your room.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.366 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Right.

00:28:54.366 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But after that I'm over it,
because the growth that I have

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:84%
opening my heart, it's
my own spirituality.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.290 align:middle line:90%
But they've accelerated that.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
gets me is, again, I

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:10.240 align:middle line:90%
had a visit March 5 at 1:22 AM.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Just to see that, and that's
the initial fear, that, oh.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.565 align:middle line:84%
But after that, it's
business as usual.

00:29:18.565 --> 00:29:20.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief," Michael.

00:29:20.815 --> 00:29:21.765 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Thank you.

00:29:21.765 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So many
different things

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:10%
happen in this universe and
maybe beyond this universe.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.556 align:middle line:10%
We'll continue to
probe these stories

00:29:29.556 --> 00:29:30.680 align:middle line:10%
on "Beyond Belief" for you.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.088 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
thanks for watching.
