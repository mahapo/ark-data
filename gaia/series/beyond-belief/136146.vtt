>>GEORGE NOORY: The
afterlife, something

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:10%
that we're all fascinated
with because one day,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:10%
we're going to visit it.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.000 align:middle line:10%
Tonight's guest
on "Beyond Belief"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:10%
deals with the afterlife.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Roberta Grimes says the truth
about death changes everything.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.730 align:middle line:10%
She is the author of
a number of books,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:10%
including the trilogy,
"The Fun of Dying,"

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:10%
"The Fun of Staying in
Touch," and "The Fun

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:10%
of Growing Forever."

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Decades after a formative
childhood experience involving

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%
light, Roberta has
studied the afterlife,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:84%
learned from communications
with the dead,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.972 align:middle line:84%
and reconciled her work
with the teachings of Jesus.

00:00:57.972 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
She reveals what
she has discovered

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:84%
regarding what humans really
are and the true purpose

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:84%
of human life, today,
on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.679 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Roberta, welcome.

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure to
have you on the show with us.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERTA GRIMES: George
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:90%
I always love talking to you.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roberta, last
time we were together,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.788 align:middle line:84%
we talked about
"The Fun of Dying."

00:01:17.788 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking about
"The Fun of Growing Forever."

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.197 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: "The Fun of
Dying" is about the process.

00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:10%
It's about what we know
about the afterlife,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:10%
about death, the process of
getting there, all of that.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:10%
"The Fun of Growing Forever" is
about what the dead have told

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:10%
us is the reason we're here.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
We're here to learn
to grow spiritually.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.280 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.531 align:middle line:84%
This is just a bad afternoon
in a spiritual gym.

00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And "The Fun of Growing
Forever" shows you

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
how to ace this lifetime
and make it your last.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're an attorney
and an expert on the afterlife.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.132 align:middle line:90%
How did those two things gel?

00:01:51.132 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: When I
was a child, I had

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:90%
an extraordinary experience.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And it made me know there's
something else going

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:90%
on we aren't being told.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So that was what made me want
to look at the afterlife.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:84%
But what I felt was that we have
almost 200 years of evidence,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.275 align:middle line:84%
abundant totally consistent
of what's going on that nobody

00:02:08.275 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:90%
was looking at at the time.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.229 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So in a
court of law you

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
could prove that the
afterlife exists?

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: I could prove.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is just a little side

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:84%
note is that a number of
attorneys are doing this.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:84%
The most prominent is Victor
Zammit in Sydney, Australia.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.018 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: His book is "A
Lawyer Presents the Evidence

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:90%
for the Afterlife."

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And he does it just
like a courtroom case.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: But yeah.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.615 align:middle line:84%
I think because we're
taught to do research,

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and we're also taught
to be skeptical--

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.859 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: --it tends to be
a good pastime for lawyers.

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
throughout this program,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.274 align:middle line:84%
we're going to hear
from some skeptics.

00:02:39.274 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:90%
And I want you to react to that.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: OK.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are people
so skeptical about it?

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
grand scale of life,

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be
a design behind it.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Mhm.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.589 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
and I'm not going

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the existence of
God because I think most of us

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:90%
believe in that.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.460 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, this
is not an accident.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not a fluke.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't need evidence
to convince me of that.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:84%
How come these people are
so skeptical about this?

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well,
I'm a skeptic too

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.877 align:middle line:84%
because I know there's
something real there,

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and I know a lot of people
have a lot of ideas about it.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:90%
And I want to know what's true.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'll only accept
what I can see fits

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:84%
with everything else we
know and there's just

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:90%
no way to refute it.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It has to be true.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:90%
So we're all skeptics.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.322 align:middle line:84%
But there are people who
feel threatened by it.

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Some people just don't want
there to be an afterlife.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Many people feel it's religious,
so there's like a dichotomy.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Either you're a serious,
science-type person

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:84%
or you're a frivolous,
religious woo-woo person.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:10%
There's no
possibility of being--

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There's no
in-between is that?

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Right.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:10%
But, in fact, in-between
is where the truth is.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.776 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: And we've got
to have the truth now,

00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:47.230 align:middle line:84%
because if we don't, this
civilization is going down.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I think we can-- we
could see it happening.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
But too many people have allowed
their spiritual vibration

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:84%
to go too low because they've
made fear-based decisions.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Fear is what
religions are about.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:84%
It's time for us to start
over and do it right.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what really,
that's the essence

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.956 align:middle line:90%
of what afterlife research is.

00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:07.330 align:middle line:84%
What are we supposed
to be doing?

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Professor Richard
Dawkins, a true skeptic,

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a look
at a little clip of this.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
- Do you wish for, or indeed
hope for an afterlife?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So this takes us
back to religion.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Richard?

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.570 align:middle line:90%
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.530 align:middle line:90%
- Let's be realistic about this.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:90%
We have brains.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It's brains that
do the thinking.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Our brains are going to decay.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.852 align:middle line:90%
That'll be that.

00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:32.656 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:33.489 align:middle line:90%
- That's depressing.

00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:84%
- But when you say if this
it, how much more do you want?

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is wonderful.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:90%
- Listen, we have--

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.568 align:middle line:90%
- Another five minutes.

00:04:41.568 --> 00:04:42.368 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:42.368 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So you don't wish
for an afterlife?

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:84%
- Wouldn't it be incredibly
tedious after the first 1,000

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.953 align:middle line:90%
years or so?

00:04:54.953 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:90%

[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So obviously,
he's appearing

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:84%
on a British
television show, kind

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.724 align:middle line:84%
of making light of the fact
that the afterlife exists.

00:05:04.724 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: These
are three things I

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
hope I can remember
of the three, which

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.720 align:middle line:90%
I think we need to address.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:84%
He says your mind is
generated by your brain.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is not
generated by your brain.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the other
way around, I think.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Your brain is nothing
more than a two-way radio

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:90%
in the head of a meat robot.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.050 align:middle line:90%
This body is the avatar.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, Jake back
in his pod, if people

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:84%
have seen that movie,
that's where our mind really

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:90%
is, nowhere near our body.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
mistake he makes.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Your mind goes on forever.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:90%
You never began.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:84%
You never will end
because in the reality,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
which even physicists
know is most a reality,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:90%
there is no time.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Time is an artifact of
the universe and only

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And the material universe
makes up less than 5%

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.352 align:middle line:90%
of what we know is true.

00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're a physicist,
you would say that.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
The rest is dark
matter and dark energy,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:90%
only because it's not material.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So he's getting off
on the wrong track.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Then he's saying the
belief in the afterlife

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:90%
has to be religious.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.546 align:middle line:90%
That's nonsense.

00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not true.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: In fact,
I've investigated

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:90%
a number of religions.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.704 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Christian scholar.

00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that none
of the main things Christians

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:84%
believe are true, none, about
the afterlife, about heaven,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.200 align:middle line:90%
about God.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:90%
None of it is true.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So let's try let's throw
the religion thing aside.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's just when people start
with the wrong suppositions,

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.950 align:middle line:84%
there's no way they can get
to the right conclusions.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And when we have a
scientific community

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:84%
where the gatekeepers
are saying,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:84%
we adopt materialism as a
fundamental dogma of science,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:84%
which they did in the early
part of the 20th century,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:84%
at that point, they're
already off the rails.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:84%
They can never get from a dogma,
which means they turn science

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:90%
into a religion, to the truth.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.145 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, frankly, we've
been in the weeds in science.

00:06:50.145 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
They put up a good
front, but they have

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:90%
made no progress in 100 years.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As an attorney, if you
had Dawkins on a witness stand

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and you were trying to grill
him about the existence

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.210 align:middle line:84%
of the afterlife, you
being a lawyer who

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:84%
believes in it, he being a
skeptic who doesn't, what

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:90%
would you ask him?

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I would
ask him where he

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.410 align:middle line:84%
gets the theory, which is all
it is, that the brain generates

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:90%
the mind?

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And I would present him
with abundant evidence

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:84%
that the brain does
not generate the mind.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
The mind is nowhere
near the brain.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.502 align:middle line:10%
Everyone's heard of NDEs,
which are very useful, even

00:07:23.502 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:10%
though they have--

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.966 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Near Death Experiences.

00:07:24.966 --> 00:07:26.065 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: I'm sorry, yes.

00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:26.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's all right.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: We talk
shorthand in this field.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows about
near-death experiences.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
There are also
out-of-body experiences.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.627 align:middle line:84%
And there are just so many
ways we know, remote viewing.

00:07:36.627 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:84%
There are so many ways we
know that the mind-- your mind

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
travels a lot, even
when you're awake.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly travels
when you're asleep.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
explain those things?

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.830 align:middle line:84%
You can't explain
them if you insist

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.770 align:middle line:84%
that the brain is anything
more than a two-way radio.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's where I'd start.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I would go on
to talk about the fact

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:84%
that we have so many
communications from people

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.630 align:middle line:90%
we used to think were dead.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And all of them are talking
about the same place.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:84%
They all had
different experiences,

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
but over 200 years of
these communications--

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and I've read
hundreds-- I've never

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:84%
seen two that were
repeated, and I've never

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.230 align:middle line:84%
seen two that talked
about a different concept.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:84%
It all has the same
physics, the same process,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:84%
the same pastimes, the same
clothing, the same everything.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
The meaning and purpose of
human life, all the same.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.068 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: If there
are no outliers,

00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that's strong evidence
that we found something real.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
a moment in my life

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that I did not believe
in the afterlife.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you what
happened, because I've always

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:90%
been a believer.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I've always believed
that there's

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.009 align:middle line:84%
much more to our existence
than what we have.

00:08:41.009 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Mhm.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I had a friend
died in a motorcycle accident.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And this must have been
about six, seven years ago.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And so all these years I'm
believing there's an afterlife.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:90%
And then I go to his funeral.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And I'm looking
at him in the casket.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I had just seen
him a couple days before.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Yeah, it's awful.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:90%
He He was alive.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:90%
He was moving.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And there he was,
stiff as a board, gone.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, Roberta,
this starkness hit me.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I felt as if, what if
there's nothing for him?

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:90%
There is no afterlife.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:84%
It was the starkest,
coldest feeling--

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Mhm.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --I've ever had.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Mhm.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't like it.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Mhm.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yep.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
I got out of it.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:90%
I changed.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:90%
I came back to the old me again.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And I went, no, there
is an afterlife.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:90%
There's something more to this.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.110 align:middle line:84%
He's in a different
plane of existence.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:90%
And I felt much better.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a horrible feeling--

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: It is.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --to think--

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: I've been there.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --it just ends.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yep.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And this is it.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, even
though I believe in it

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and you believe in
it, was the creation

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.860 align:middle line:84%
of the existence
of the afterlife

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:84%
created by theologians
and religious people

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
to give us that feeling of
hope that this continues?

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: The reality is, and
there's so much evidence that

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:middle line:84%
cannot be refuted, the reality
is your mind is eternal.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And it is part of the eternal
mind that continuously

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.060 align:middle line:90%
manifests the universe.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else exists that's real.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And we can prove that
six ways to Sunday.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Max Planck said it,
for heaven's sake.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein said
variations of the same thing,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
but they ignored those
things they said,

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:90%
which is a little silly.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
to the basic fact

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
that there is so
much more going on,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and then you look
at the fact that we

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.620 align:middle line:84%
have so many
communications from people

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and they tell us the
truth, I have to tell you.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't come from religion.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.440 align:middle line:90%
It comes from our knowing.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:84%
We all have an inner knowing,
which we can choose to reject.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, it's a
shock, of course, when

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:48.258 align:middle line:90%
you see a friend in a casket.

00:10:48.258 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: You've going
to get past the idea

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:90%
that body was him.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:90%
And that can be hard.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, our
minds are eternal.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you get that to
the depth of your soul,

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:90%
it changes everything.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But no, the afterlife
is not religious,

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:90%
has nothing to do with religion.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what I've told
people, if there's an afterlife

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and when we die, you're
going to know about it.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:90%
You're going to know about it.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.016 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: [LAUGHS]
yeah, for sure.

00:11:13.016 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there is no
afterlife, it doesn't matter.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.488 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you
won't know about it.

00:11:18.488 --> 00:11:19.450 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:84%

positively that it exists.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:10%
And by the way,
is that so weird?

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.390 align:middle line:10%
Did you have consciousness
before you were born?

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:10%
Were you saying, how
come I'm not on Earth?

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.110 align:middle line:10%
My gosh, I need to be on Earth.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:10%
Or how could-- where am I?

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:10%
There's just the
state of nonexistence.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.120 align:middle line:90%
- Ah.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
- And so I'm not
given any reason--

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.475 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah, but now I am born.

00:11:54.475 --> 00:11:55.275 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:11:55.275 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
- And I can't stand the
thought of nonexistence.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.721 align:middle line:90%
See, I already have existence.

00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- I accept that.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.650 align:middle line:90%
- OK, it is true.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:90%
We fear death--

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.440 align:middle line:90%
- You bet.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.530 align:middle line:84%
- --because we are
born knowing only life.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:10%
- Right.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.510 align:middle line:10%
- I get that.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:14.120 align:middle line:10%
However, I take another view,
because I've been asked.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.256 align:middle line:10%
If you could live
forever, would you?

00:12:16.256 --> 00:12:17.056 align:middle line:10%
- Yes.

00:12:17.056 --> 00:12:19.640 align:middle line:10%
- [LAUGHS] OK, we're
done with the interview.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:10%
- [ ?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:20.800 align:middle line:10%
I don't even have to
finish this sentence ? ]

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.600 align:middle line:10%
- Yes.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.830 align:middle line:10%
No, OK, sure.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:10%
That's an attractive idea.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:10%
But the way I look at it
is it is the knowledge

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:36.215 align:middle line:10%
that I'm going to die that
creates the focus that I bring

00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:37.015 align:middle line:10%
to being alive.

00:12:37.015 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so there was Neil
appearing with Larry King.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Larry wants to live
forever, forever.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Bless his heart.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.351 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, is that possible
when you think about it,

00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily physically,
but also living forever

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:90%
in the other side?

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: We're eternal
by definition because we

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:90%
exist outside of time.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And because that's true, it's
impossible not to live forever.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I tell-- I hear from people
who are contemplating suicide.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I tell them the
problem with suicide

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.250 align:middle line:90%
is you can't kill your mind.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.740 align:middle line:84%
You just make all your problems
worse if you kill yourself.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:90%
So don't do it.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:90%
It's easier to fix them here.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.240 align:middle line:90%
But yes, we have memories.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Pre-birth memories are common.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:84%
The problem with people
like him is they're

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:90%
going through around like this.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.154 align:middle line:90%
[HUMS] oh, there's no afterlife.

00:13:25.154 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:90%
But they don't want to know.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.854 align:middle line:90%
They never look at the evidence.

00:13:27.854 --> 00:13:30.020 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the evidence,
you can't dispute it.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:30.917 align:middle line:10%
You can't

00:13:30.917 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There's too much.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: There's too much.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.020 align:middle line:10%
And it comes at you from all
different directions too.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:10%
That's what's beautiful.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:90%
It all fits together.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a gigantic
tapestry being

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:90%
assembled by the researchers.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But there are many people
who have pre-birth memories,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.015 align:middle line:90%
so he's just being silly.

00:13:45.015 --> 00:13:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've written a
couple of books, Roberta,

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:90%
about the afterlife.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:middle line:84%
One's called, of course,
"The Fun of Dying."

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you
about that title

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, "The
Fun of Growing Forever."

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.910 align:middle line:90%
It's your series, "The Fun of."

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
think it's fun to die?

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: It's not my idea.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:84%
The dead tell us that
over and over again.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:90%
The dead tell us it's fun.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:10.082 align:middle line:84%
The process of death
can be very pleasurable.

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Getting there isn't so
good because your body's

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.145 align:middle line:84%
got to be made weak
enough to be able to die.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:84%
But once you're
out of your body,

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:84%
the very act of leaving your
body is almost orgasmic,

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:90%
some of them tell us.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're young, and
light, and free, and happy.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And you feel terrific, suddenly,
when you were, basically,

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:84%
in a doorstop a few minutes
ago, your whole body.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.890 align:middle line:90%
So that part's fun.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to
the afterlife, which

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:84%
happens right away, because
it's in the same place

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.850 align:middle line:84%
we are, just on a different--
slight changing channels.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Your mind changes channels.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:90%
That's all that happens.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.950 align:middle line:84%
When you get there, there
is so much more to do.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Everybody you used to think was
dead is alive, young, healthy,

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:90%
happy.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.730 align:middle line:90%
It's infinitely fun.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's good about the
earth is there a thousandfold.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's negative
about the earth has gone.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:84%
What's not good-- what's
not to like about that?

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.025 align:middle line:90%
It's all fun.

00:14:59.025 --> 00:15:01.525 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to look at some
graphics about the afterlife

00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:90%
and have you comment--

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: OK.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.206 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --on some of those.

00:15:04.206 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at our first one.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So Roberta, what are we
looking at right here?

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: This is
a typical scene.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:84%
It looks very earth-like,
beautiful water, fountains,

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
lovely, lovely
garden, basically.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Only there, the flowers
would be in colors

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.710 align:middle line:84%
we've never seen before
because they exist

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.410 align:middle line:90%
outside the afterlife spectrum.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:90%
The trees are alive.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:84%
If you walk by them, they'll
caress you as you go by.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And the water is what
Jesus called living water.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
You walk into it, and you
can walk right through it

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:90%
and come out dry.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:90%
But it's full of energy.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you--
it rejuvenates you.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like having,
again, it's thrilling.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything that happens
there is thrilling.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's this like what
you would feel in the afterlife?

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.690 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: This is a
typical scene in the middle

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.035 align:middle line:10%
of-- the Summerland levels,
which are loosely levels three,

00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:10%
four, and five of a--

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.201 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And what do you mean
by the Summerland levels?

00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:56.390 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: The afterlife
has infinite sub-levels.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
They're just slight changes
in vibration in this energy.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.104 align:middle line:84%
But we break them up
into the lowest level,

00:16:03.104 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:90%
which is the outer darkness.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Jesus called it that.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:90%
There's a slightly better level.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And then levels
three through five

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.950 align:middle line:84%
are like that, only the higher
you go, the more beautiful

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:84%
it is, many formal
gardens, especially

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:84%
for the North American
and British Summerlands.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.480 align:middle line:90%
But it's culture-specific.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So if we died in China and
went to the same place,

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.300 align:middle line:90%
we would find pagodas.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.360 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Whatever we
would like to see is there.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So we would see
that in the afterlife.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's this.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Nice garden.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yes, but notice
how it looks earth-like,

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:90%
but a little bit different.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you mean,
the flowers are--

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.070 align:middle line:84%
there was more flowers
there probably.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But they're not quite--
they're not daisies.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that people
enjoy about the afterlife

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%
when they first get there
is that it looks familiar,

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.290 align:middle line:84%
but it's just much
more interesting.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:90%
There's more going on.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.100 align:middle line:90%
The colors are so different.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you might
walk down this path

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and all the foliage
could be orange

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
need chlorophyll.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
know that's real?

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.250 align:middle line:90%
How do we know that exists?

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.833 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Because
the dead tell us so.

00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:04.720 align:middle line:84%
We have so many
communications now.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.111 align:middle line:10%
And the communication
between the afterlife

00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:08.319 align:middle line:10%
is getting better and better.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And they over and over
and over again tell us.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is neat because in the
afterlife of the North American

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:21.609 align:middle line:90%
Summerland there are mountains.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:84%
See the foothills that are
closer, and then beautiful

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:90%
mountains.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Mikey Morgan, with whom I
co-wrote a book with his mother

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Carol, snowboards still.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:84%
He died at 20, and
he still snowboards.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is the kind
of thing it looks like,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:90%
these beautiful mountains.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And just as an aside, you
see those little trees

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:84%
which probably would be
pretty far away from us?

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: According
to the dead, we

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
are mind site, which is what
we have in the afterlife.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:10%
Not only is it 360
degrees, but it is so good

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:10%
that you're able to see
every leaf on every tree

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:10%
on every mountain.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now, there are
some upper levels, fifth

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:10%
and sixth levels.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: The fifth levels--

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
levels are there?

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well,
there are seven-ish.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Seven-ish levels.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: We don't
know what's above it.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: And they
haven't told us.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this
would be level five.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.470 align:middle line:10%
What are we looking
at here, Roberta?

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.345 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Well, notice
how the higher we get,

00:18:10.345 --> 00:18:12.570 align:middle line:10%
the more sort of
surreal it looks.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.900 align:middle line:10%
Notice how the sky is
not blue because it

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.980 align:middle line:10%
doesn't have to be blue.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:10%
For many afterlife scenes, it's
actually pink or orangey-pink.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:10%
And the trees look
normal, but not quite.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.130 align:middle line:10%
And notice they're sort
of colors down here

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.145 align:middle line:10%
that look a little strange.

00:18:28.145 --> 00:18:28.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.533 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: It just
doesn't look normal,

00:18:30.533 --> 00:18:33.150 align:middle line:10%
but it looks almost like
the earth, only fantastical.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:10%
This is roughly what
level six looks like.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:10%
And level six also has wonderful
universities, beautiful places

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:10%
of learning, because
at level six,

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:10%
we are at the highest
level below the source.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.950 align:middle line:90%
The source is at level seven.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And it looks a
little bit like this.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Pleasant.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How about this one?

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: The fact that the
sky is blue would probably not

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:90%
be accurate.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:84%
But notice we've got here
some fantastical buildings.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.060 align:middle line:90%
There's no gravity there.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So the buildings can
be very fantastical,

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
especially the higher
you go, because nothing

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:90%
is going to fall down.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And we get to mind
create whatever

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
we like as we get to a
higher level of vibration.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.594 align:middle line:90%
It's just more fun.

00:19:16.594 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Everyone should be working
on spiritual growth

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
because the higher you go,
the more fun you can have.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:84%
But this is another
typical scene.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.050 align:middle line:10%
And since travel is by
mind and instantaneous,

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:10%
this might be a beautiful
city with nobody in it

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:10%
unless someone feels like
going there, because we all

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.679 align:middle line:10%
decide we want to go to Tahiti
this afternoon, we'll be there.

00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:35.512 align:middle line:90%
Just think about it.

00:19:35.512 --> 00:19:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are no traffic
jams in the afterlife.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: No traffic
jams, that's right.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.071 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And let's look
at our last graphic here.

00:19:41.071 --> 00:19:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: This is a
university on level six.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I question
the color of the sky.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:84%
But for the rest,
it's pretty accurate.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Notice that some of them are
dressed in these long robes

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and they look like
angel robes, almost.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Those are called spirit robes.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And they would, in
a genuine scene,

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.226 align:middle line:84%
they would actually be in
light colors, pastel colors.

00:20:01.226 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those are souls,
basically, those people?

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.490 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Those
are people, yeah.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:05.552 align:middle line:10%
They are.

00:20:05.552 --> 00:20:06.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Who have passed on.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Yes, and
they're in level six.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:10%
So when they go to level
six-- because you can always

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:10%
go higher.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean lower.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:90%
You cannot go higher.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you are only developed
at level four level,

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:90%
you can't go to this place.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you've developed yourself
sufficiently, you can go there.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.578 align:middle line:84%
And then you can go back
to level three or four

00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:90%
and see the family.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.867 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roberta, what
is the hell level?

00:20:27.867 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:90%
What would that be called?

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: That's
the outer darkness.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.527 align:middle line:84%
There is no hell in
the sense of a burning,

00:20:34.527 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:90%
you know, burning in fire.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't exist.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Jesus called it
the outer darkness

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.453 align:middle line:84%
where there will be wailing
and gnashing of teeth.

00:20:40.453 --> 00:20:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's the lowest level,
right above the earth level.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's dark, dank,
smelly, unpleasant,

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.630 align:middle line:84%
full of demons who
are really people.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're presenting
the way they feel.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.210 align:middle line:84%
People who have not been
able to forgive themselves

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.844 align:middle line:84%
for what they did in life
very often end up there.

00:20:56.844 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get
out on your own.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be rescued.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do those in
the afterlife talk

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:90%
about that hell-like state?

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: The hell-like state?

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah, do they
report back and say,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.166 align:middle line:10%
this is what it's like,
like they did with these?

00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:09.966 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Oh, sure.

00:21:09.966 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:10%
Oh, sure.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
that can happen

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.670 align:middle line:10%
if you're fairly
well-developed right after you

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:10%
die, you may be asked if
you're willing to go and do

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:10%
some relief work in
the lowest level,

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:10%
because your vibration is
still raising for a time

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:10%
after you die.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And someone who has just
died is more readily

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:84%
perceived by someone
in the lowest level.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So they can't see the high-level
being who is taking you there.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.600 align:middle line:90%
But they may be able to see you.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.897 align:middle line:84%
And if they do, then
you basically say,

00:21:39.897 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:84%
there's a guy with me
who wants to help you.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And try to get the attention
of the people there.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they're just
steeped in their own misery.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the
afterlife, there's also

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:90%
that belief in reincarnation.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Mhm.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So at one
point do these souls

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:90%
regenerate and come back?

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: What seems to be the
case is the whole unit that

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.090 align:middle line:84%
was here, from your grandparents
down through grandchildren,

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.390 align:middle line:84%
will stay there,
because people say,

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.550 align:middle line:84%
what if mom reincarnates
before I get there?

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But we hunger for spiritual
growth when we're there.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Think of every craving
you've ever had

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and put it all together, whether
it's food, sex, success, money,

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.275 align:middle line:84%
everything, and
multiply that by 100.

00:22:21.275 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's how much you
want to grow spiritually

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:90%
when you're in the afterlife.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:90%
So that craving comes over you.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or
later, if you're not

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:84%
able to advance
without reincarnating,

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:90%
you'll be happy to do it.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.794 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember
the movie "What Dreams May

00:22:34.794 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Come" with Robin Williams,
God rest his soul.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:90%
He's now in the afterlife.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: He is, and having fun.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How bizarre that it is.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --is it
really that way?

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how they depicted that?

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Not quite.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Some of it looked right-ish.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:84%
But the notion that he's-- she's
in a low level if I can recall

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:90%
the movie.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.846 align:middle line:84%
She's in a low level,
and he is going

00:22:57.846 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:90%
to be there to be with her.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
But very soon they won't
recognize each other.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:90%
That was pathetic.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: And that's kind of--
if she could perceive him,

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and he's at a higher arbitrary
level, he can rescue her.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:84%
That's what the work would be,
because our minds are eternal.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is condemned
permanently to any place.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:90%
There's always growth.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.640 align:middle line:84%
It just takes a lot
longer for people

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.005 align:middle line:90%
who refuse to try to grow.

00:23:21.005 --> 00:23:22.270 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: As we get
up in age, Roberta,

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.330 align:middle line:84%
we begin to think about
death a little bit more

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:84%
than we did when we
were 10 or 20 years old.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Right.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What words of
wisdom would you give people

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:84%
as they get a little older, as
they get closer to that moment?

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Because it's going to happen.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I think
it's much better

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.520 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand
what's actually going on.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:84%
People who die as very strict
Christians die in fear.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.619 align:middle line:84%
And I hear that over and over
again from hospice workers.

00:23:50.619 --> 00:23:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I was the strictest
Christian you can

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.840 align:middle line:90%
imagine for most of my life.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.120 align:middle line:84%
I read the Bible six or
eight times, cover to cover,

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:84%
majored in religion and
Christianity in college.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to tell you
what they tell you is wrong.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's time when you get to
be 60, 70 years old, it's time

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
to try to learn what's
true, because the truth is

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:90%
where God is.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.060 align:middle line:90%
God is truth.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.896 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, you
shall know the truth,

00:24:12.896 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and the truth will
make you free.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:90%
It does make you free.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So I would say first off, forget
what they tell you in church

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and try to learn the truth for
yourself, because it is beyond

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:90%
wonderful.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And you are much more loved
than you can possibly imagine.

atheist, Christopher Hitchens,

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:90%

That's-- this is real to them
as the rest of their pathetic

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:49.580 align:middle line:90%
lives are.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.540 align:middle line:90%

- And you point?

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
- It's subjective, and
it's wish-fulfilling.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't count.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually a bit
amazed we haven't

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle line:90%
got to wish fulfillment yet.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:01.985 align:middle line:90%
Can I say a word about that?

00:25:01.985 --> 00:25:02.880 align:middle line:90%
- Sure.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.930 align:middle line:84%
- I mean Freud in his
"Future of an Illusion"

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:84%
says that the connection between
our desires and our beliefs,

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.960 align:middle line:84%
in the case of the
afterlife, is so obvious.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
It's mankind's oldest
and most strong dread.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we could
duck the fate that

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.740 align:middle line:90%
appears to be in store for us.

I'm not even sure if they

>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a strange story.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:84%
But again, here's another person
who may be on the other side.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that they say to
themselves, why was I so wrong?

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Yeah,
of course they do.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And everyone goes
through a life review.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're shown
your entire life.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're made to feel
the way you made everybody

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.650 align:middle line:90%
feel during your life.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's the hard
part because people

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.520 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of trouble
forgiving themselves

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:90%
if they've hurt people.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:90%
And she hurt a lot of people.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So it is quite possible that
she couldn't forgive herself.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And she may right now be
in the outer darkness,

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and people are
trying to rescue her.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:10%
That would be my guess with her.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Can you be rescued?

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:84%
But you have to first
perceive your rescuers.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:84%
That's usually the problem,
because higher-level beings

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:84%
are the only ones who
are safe going there.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:90%
And they can't be seen.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you cross over
if you're a really good person,

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
they will say, you have
a little space and time

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.092 align:middle line:84%
where they may be able
to see you down there.

00:26:52.092 --> 00:26:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Will you come with us please?

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.350 align:middle line:90%
And they take you there.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What message would
you impart on people, Roberta,

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:00.657 align:middle line:84%
who are on the fence
about the afterlife?

00:27:00.657 --> 00:27:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Don't be
afraid to investigate it.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I think the hardest part of
investigating the afterlife

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.605 align:middle line:90%
is what if the news is bad.

00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even think
about that till I'd

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
spent decades doing it, because
I knew it wouldn't be bad.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.805 align:middle line:90%
But it's good.

00:27:14.805 --> 00:27:15.680 align:middle line:90%
All the news is good.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So do the investigation
because it makes you happy.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And once you really get it, the
most important thing it does,

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:90%
I think, is take away all fear.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Fear of death is the base fear.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And fear is the most
negative emotion we can have.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you're living
in fear of death

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.830 align:middle line:84%
or of fear of
anything else, you're

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.560 align:middle line:84%
not going to be able to
make much progress here.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.609 align:middle line:84%
You'll be coming back
over and over again.

00:27:38.609 --> 00:27:40.400 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists call it
turning on the wheel.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.320 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do that.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.694 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now did
this information

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:45.530 align:middle line:84%
come to you by spirit
guides, by those

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.060 align:middle line:90%
who died on the other side?

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.122 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are you that kind
of an intuitive medium?

00:27:50.122 --> 00:27:51.330 align:middle line:90%
How does this happen for you?

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:84%

a medium at all.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.353 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I used to think
I was psychic as a post.

00:27:55.353 --> 00:27:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've lately discovered
all my books were channeled.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:03.080 align:middle line:84%
But all my research has been
done the hard way, using books.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And this was back when
we had no internet.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.646 align:middle line:90%
So I bought a lot of books.

00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:09.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So these are stories
from other cases and things

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:09.210 align:middle line:10%
like that?

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.584 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: They're
usually stories

00:28:10.584 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:84%
from people who are dead
coming through trusted sources.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I trust very little that's
been received after 1950

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.880 align:middle line:84%
because I sort of think it's
probably commercialized.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Mhm.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But before
1950, there was

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.370 align:middle line:84%
a heyday of deep-trance
medium communications.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.367 align:middle line:90%
And they are excellent.

00:28:28.367 --> 00:28:29.450 align:middle line:90%
And they all fit together.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.372 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
questions were asked.

00:28:31.372 --> 00:28:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Some of them weren't, though.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's frustrating
to read the old stuff,

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and you have a question
and nobody is asking it

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:39.080 align:middle line:84%
until finally, very
late, someone one

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:84%
said to I think it was
their daughter who had died.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:43.890 align:middle line:90%
So are you solid?

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:90%
Are you a vapor?

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.670 align:middle line:90%
She said, I'm solid as you are.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:47.630 align:middle line:90%
I thought, duh.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:48.491 align:middle line:90%
Of course, she is.

00:28:48.491 --> 00:28:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take us through
a moment of death

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:84%
from somebody who's
in the hospital.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.360 align:middle line:84%
They're on their hospital
bed, and they're dying.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Take us through
that process that

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:90%
gets them into the afterlife.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Two or three
days before death,

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:84%
usually pain goes away,
which is why it's a mistake

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.240 align:middle line:90%
to heavily medicate the dead.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.050 align:middle line:84%
They don't need
it after a while.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And usually within 24 to 48
hours, sometimes only 12 hours,

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:84%
they start to see people
they used to think were dead.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows that Steve Jobs'
last words we're, "Oh wow.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:20.465 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow."

00:29:20.465 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, amazing.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Hours before he died.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:25.940 align:middle line:84%
That was when his
relatives showed up.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:84%
That is when you know
everything is going to be fine.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And usually, the
people at that stage

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:84%
stop communicating
with the living.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.992 align:middle line:84%
Then as you actually
are dying, you're

00:29:35.992 --> 00:29:37.700 align:middle line:84%
like you're built like
a Matryoshka doll,

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:90%
like a Russian doll.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:84%
You've got internal
energy bodies.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of
them are staying.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.879 align:middle line:90%
This is an energy body too.

00:29:43.879 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:84%
We aren't aware that our
material bodies are just

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.970 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:90%
But the rest is leaving.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.310 align:middle line:90%
So it gathers.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:84%
It like gets out of your
fingers, out of your toes,

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:90%
up into your torso.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And then it leaves out
through the top of the head

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:90%
or through--

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At death.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: --the chest.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's death.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: That's
not quite death.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.750 align:middle line:10%
That's the process of
getting out of the body.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:03.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.240 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: And that
feels terrific.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.390 align:middle line:84%
As I've said, some people
say it feels orgasmic.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Usually, people who are at the
deathbed may actually see it.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:84%
They may see a
mist over the body.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can find on the internet
mice being killed in a trap

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and see a [WHOOP] go
out of their bodies.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's a known phenomenon.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:84%
You form into a body
almost immediately.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's a young,
healthy, beautiful body

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:27.800 align:middle line:90%
because your mind forms it.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.600 align:middle line:90%
It's naked.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.550 align:middle line:84%
You go oops, and you clothe
yourself with your mind.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're still attached
to that body by what's

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:90%
called the silver cord.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.590 align:middle line:90%
But it's frayed.

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:90%
And it suddenly breaks.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Then the body stops breathing.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.600 align:middle line:90%
That's the moment of death.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's a dangerous time--

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.040 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: --because if you see
everybody going, oh, he died.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.460 align:middle line:10%
She died.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:10%
What do we do?

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.170 align:middle line:10%
They want to comfort them
because here you are.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:49.970 align:middle line:10%
You feel terrific.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:51.140 align:middle line:10%
I never felt better.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.540 align:middle line:10%
But you can't pay attention
to those around the bed

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.810 align:middle line:10%
because if you do, you'll
lower your spiritual vibration.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be
the way we make ghosts.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.500 align:middle line:84%
You can make it so you can't
see your rescuers anymore

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:00.657 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:00.657 --> 00:31:01.457 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.457 --> 00:31:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: But you don't do that.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.483 align:middle line:84%
You say, Roberta
said I can't do that.

00:31:04.483 --> 00:31:05.677 align:middle line:90%
So you go with them.

00:31:05.677 --> 00:31:07.760 align:middle line:84%
It feels like you're going
through a sort of a fog

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.600 align:middle line:90%
usually.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.210 align:middle line:84%
There's no tunnel and light,
by the way, in a real death.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.900 align:middle line:90%
And then the mist clears.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the same place, you see
this gorgeous new solid reality

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.370 align:middle line:84%
around you, just as if
you'd changed a TV channel.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:20.440 align:middle line:90%
That's how death feels.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how long do
you stay on the other side

00:31:22.565 --> 00:31:26.270 align:middle line:84%
before you reincarnate,
come back, whatever?

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: There
is no time there.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, all our lifetimes
are being lived at once.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand it.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
They say we'll understand
it when we get there.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So we can stay basically
an infinite amount of time.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a recovery period,
which is what we enter first

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.340 align:middle line:84%
where if we'd been damaged,
we might even go to a hospital

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and be convinced that
our body is healthy now.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:84%
If we've had traumatic
experiences, we get counseling.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.720 align:middle line:90%
And we just have fun.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like R and R.
And then gradually,

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:59.310 align:middle line:84%
we sort of settle in, and
everybody else has come.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And we know when it's
time to come back.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a
time-ish kind of time.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a feeling in
our spirits that's it time.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:07.822 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's a spiritual gut.

00:32:07.822 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Yes, exactly.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:09.740 align:middle line:10%
Perfectly said.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Got some
questions for you.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:11.800 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: OK.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sarah from
Manhattan in New York.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.770 align:middle line:10%
We just had to put our
beloved dog to sleep.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:16.570 align:middle line:10%
That's sad.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.400 align:middle line:10%
And the whole family
feels terrible about it.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.950 align:middle line:10%
Is there some kind
of a Rainbow Bridge.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.240 align:middle line:10%
Will we see him again?

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.159 align:middle line:10%
Will he forgive us
for helping him die?

00:32:25.159 --> 00:32:26.450 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: I love this question.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.390 align:middle line:90%
I get it almost every day now.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:30.860 align:middle line:84%
If people go to
robertagrimes.com,

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.410 align:middle line:84%
there's a blog post,
which I think is called,

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:34.670 align:middle line:90%
"When a Pet Dies."

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:90%
It has a ton of comments.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:37.780 align:middle line:90%
And people Google and find it.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.613 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, good.

00:32:38.613 --> 00:32:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: And that's
how they come to me.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
we're most certain of

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.877 align:middle line:84%
is that every pet that's
been loved by a human being,

00:32:45.877 --> 00:32:47.585 align:middle line:84%
even whether it's not
a dog or cat-- mine

00:32:47.585 --> 00:32:49.020 align:middle line:90%
is a horse-- they're there.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:49.820 align:middle line:90%
They're young.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:90%
They're healthy.

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.070 align:middle line:90%
They're happy.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.580 align:middle line:84%
They're thrilled
with their lives.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.900 align:middle line:90%
And they're waiting for us.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things,
of which we're most certain.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Other things which we think
this and that, it's for certain.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:02.810 align:middle line:84%
If you loved a pet, that
pet is waiting for you.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:05.394 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will the pet forgive
them for putting him down?

00:33:05.394 --> 00:33:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: In fact, the
pets are very grateful,

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:84%
because it's a lot better
there than it is here.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.350 align:middle line:84%
If you're in an old
doggy body, it's

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.400 align:middle line:84%
no better than being
in an old human body.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, if you have
a pet, give the pet

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:18.960 align:middle line:84%
the grace of being put down if
the dog is suffering at all.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've heard
incredible stories of people

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.150 align:middle line:90%
who might be in their bed.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And they will see paw
prints of their dog or cat.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:26.095 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: That happens.

00:33:26.095 --> 00:33:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.450 align:middle line:90%
The animal comes back.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: I talk about that in
"The Fun of Staying in Touch,"

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.400 align:middle line:84%
which is another one
of the "Fun" books.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.132 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of signs
that the dead pets give us.

00:33:37.132 --> 00:33:38.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's a very common one.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.064 align:middle line:84%
If a dog has slept on your
bed, you may very well

00:33:41.064 --> 00:33:42.230 align:middle line:90%
see and feel the paw prints.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.810 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: And then that little
depression when the dog goes

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:46.560 align:middle line:10%
lies down by your leg or
wherever he used to be.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:46.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's remarkable.

00:33:46.905 --> 00:33:47.250 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Isn't it wonderful?

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: John in Phoenix.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I lost my mother three years
ago and haven't had any signs

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.390 align:middle line:90%
from her at all.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Is she OK?

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.050 align:middle line:10%
How would I know if she's OK?

00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:90%
What could I do to help her?

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: People get
signs, I think, with almost

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.157 align:middle line:90%
every completed death.

00:34:05.157 --> 00:34:07.490 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is people
don't know what the signs are.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:10.310 align:middle line:84%
There are many more signs
the dead give us commonly

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.050 align:middle line:90%
than most people are aware of.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:84%
"The Fun of Growing Forever"
outlines what those signs are.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:20.210 align:middle line:84%
When I get an email like that,
I usually say, here's my book.

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.300 align:middle line:90%
I send them the PDF.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And I say, tell me when
you see your first sign.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.040 align:middle line:90%
It usually comes within a day.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That fast, huh?

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:26.374 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Yeah.

00:34:26.374 --> 00:34:27.124 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It comes to us.

00:34:27.124 --> 00:34:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Because they want
us to know they're fine.

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:30.448 align:middle line:90%
It's like they send postcards.

00:34:30.448 --> 00:34:32.239 align:middle line:84%
Those signs are just
postcards, saying hey,

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:32.960 align:middle line:90%
I've arrived safely.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm going to go have fun.

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if you never
get that connection,

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.564 align:middle line:90%
does that mean anything?

00:34:37.564 --> 00:34:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Usually not.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And I usually don't talk
about what it might mean,

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.510 align:middle line:84%
because if someone's lived
even a halfway decent life,

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.586 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they're fine.

00:34:45.586 --> 00:34:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Some of them don't
want to communicate.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.219 align:middle line:84%
My own father didn't want to
communicate with anybody here

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:50.565 align:middle line:90%
for 20 years after his death.

00:34:50.565 --> 00:34:51.139 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: They're people.

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.020 align:middle line:84%
They're the same people
they were in life.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.570 align:middle line:84%
If someone has real
issues and ends up

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:58.580 align:middle line:84%
in the outer darkness
level, they're

00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:59.840 align:middle line:90%
not able to communicate.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.130 align:middle line:90%
That's about the only thing.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.990 align:middle line:84%
One woman who talked
me about her son who

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.630 align:middle line:84%
had lived a very difficult
life, not been a nice person,

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and killed himself, and
she couldn't get any signs.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.724 align:middle line:84%
I am pretty certain he not
where he can talk to her.

00:35:10.724 --> 00:35:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
I've had two family

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.560 align:middle line:90%
members who have passed on.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
I still haven't

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:17.330 align:middle line:90%
had any contact with them.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Not that I go seek get it.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.304 align:middle line:90%
But it hasn't come to me.

00:35:22.304 --> 00:35:24.345 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Almost always,
they're giving us signs.

00:35:24.345 --> 00:35:26.345 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we aren't
aware of what they are.

00:35:26.345 --> 00:35:27.590 align:middle line:90%
And they're subtle.

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:30.039 align:middle line:84%
And also, people
tend to doubt them.

00:35:30.039 --> 00:35:31.580 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, that
could be a sign.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.135 align:middle line:84%
But it could also
be a coincidence--

00:35:33.135 --> 00:35:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: --or the weather,
or who knows what else.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So I just recommend that
people open their minds

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.380 align:middle line:90%
to the possibility.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you see a
sign, always say, thank you.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:42.650 align:middle line:90%
I see that.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Do it again.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Say it aloud, because the
energy of your recognition

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:49.610 align:middle line:84%
helps to strengthen their
ability to give us signs.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Karina from Los Angeles.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm terrified of
death, she says.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.930 align:middle line:10%
I think about it all the time.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.050 align:middle line:10%
How can you be so sure
that there is anything

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:03.830 align:middle line:10%
after we die, something we've
been talking about all night?

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: If you never
look up, you will never

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.200 align:middle line:90%
know if there's a sky.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.500 align:middle line:84%
People don't know where
to look for the proof.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:90%
The proof is everywhere.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:17.480 align:middle line:84%
All of my "Fun" books
have a 70-odd book

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.000 align:middle line:84%
annotated bibliography of the
people who-- don't believe me.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But there are experts
who have spent

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.100 align:middle line:84%
their lives researching
little areas

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.900 align:middle line:90%
of the afterlife evidence.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Read.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Open your mind and
heart and read.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:84%
There is no possibility at
all that you will ever die.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.540 align:middle line:90%
It is impossible for you to die.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.350 align:middle line:90%
We can state that.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
think that's one

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:38.458 align:middle line:90%
of the most important things.

00:36:38.458 --> 00:36:40.642 align:middle line:84%
People really need to
open up themselves.

00:36:40.642 --> 00:36:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: That's right.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.392 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And believe this.

00:36:43.392 --> 00:36:45.975 align:middle line:84%
Because if they fight it, that's
not going to happen for them.

00:36:45.975 --> 00:36:46.520 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: No, No.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.770 align:middle line:10%
And it's good to be skeptical.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.690 align:middle line:10%
It's just don't be so skeptical
that you close yourself in,

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:10%
because that just is
counterproductive.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Brady
from Philadelphia.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.450 align:middle line:10%
I have never been
able to believe in God

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:57.920 align:middle line:10%
although I really try.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.650 align:middle line:10%
What advice do you have for
people who simply do not

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:10%
or cannot believe?

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: Well, I'm
going to say something

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.940 align:middle line:90%
a little controversial.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:84%
The Christian God
does not exist.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.820 align:middle line:84%
What exists is
something a lot better,

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.220 align:middle line:84%
which is the best
definition I've ever seen.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.590 align:middle line:84%
It's an energy-like potentiality
without size, without form,

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:20.690 align:middle line:84%
alive in the way your mind
is alive, highly emotional.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And the only emotion of God
is love, therefore probably

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.240 align:middle line:90%
self-aware, no size, no shape.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And God is the only
thing that exists.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:29.900 align:middle line:90%
That's God.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.310 align:middle line:90%
But God is the perfect.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:32.960 align:middle line:90%
God does not have human flaws.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.650 align:middle line:84%
God never takes human form,
except apparently, as Jesus.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.200 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be what the
dead are telling us now.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But God isn't like the Chris--
I don't believe in the Christian

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:43.670 align:middle line:90%
God either.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Christian
God is cranky.

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And imagine a God that is so
judgmental that that God can't

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.862 align:middle line:84%
forgive you for being human
unless that God gets to enjoy

00:37:53.862 --> 00:37:55.070 align:middle line:90%
watching his son be murdered.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And wipes out
civilizations and things

00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.850 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:58.820 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Oh, my goodness.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.635 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've always had a
difficult time with that.

00:38:00.635 --> 00:38:00.800 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Yes.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.846 align:middle line:10%
That God does not exist.

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:02.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: And everything
else that exists

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.820 align:middle line:84%
is just an artifact
of God, exists within

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.607 align:middle line:84%
God, something like
a thought, really.

00:38:09.607 --> 00:38:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roberta, what's
your advice on how people

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.810 align:middle line:90%
can grow spiritually together?

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: The greatest spiritual
lessons that I've ever found

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:18.830 align:middle line:90%
are in the Gospels.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:84%
No Christian I've
ever met follows them.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.600 align:middle line:84%
But my book, "The Fun
of Growing Forever,"

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:84%
is an easy, quick
handbook for Westerners

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:28.130 align:middle line:90%
in how to grow spiritually.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:29.450 align:middle line:84%
You can get to the--
you can make this

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:30.866 align:middle line:84%
your last lifetime,
even if you're

00:38:30.866 --> 00:38:32.290 align:middle line:90%
60 when you start this process.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.550 align:middle line:84%
That's how easy and
how quick it is.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:35.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's fun.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.430 align:middle line:90%
And what is spiritual growth?

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual growth
is infinite love.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you've ever been
in love in your life,

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.230 align:middle line:84%
imagine feeling like
that all the time.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would be your
best tip, then, for people?

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.910 align:middle line:90%
To love?

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: No, it's a process.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.420 align:middle line:90%
The hardest part is forgiveness.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.760 align:middle line:84%
You can't forgive each little
thing because if you do,

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.050 align:middle line:90%
it makes you crazy.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.730 align:middle line:84%
But in "The Fun of
Growing Forever,"

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:58.846 align:middle line:84%
I talk about how you can
use the teachings of Jesus

00:38:58.846 --> 00:39:00.470 align:middle line:84%
to forgive everything
once and for all,

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:04.335 align:middle line:84%
and then never be bothered
by anything again.

00:39:04.335 --> 00:39:05.135 align:middle line:90%
I mean it.

00:39:05.135 --> 00:39:05.935 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:39:05.935 --> 00:39:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can forgive everything,
even the most horrible things.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So as an
attorney, you're

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.370 align:middle line:84%
now in a court room
of the afterlife.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.710 align:middle line:90%
And you have closing arguments.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.171 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:18.920 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: I think that
the burden of proof

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.470 align:middle line:10%
has now been shifted to the
people who insist that there

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:25.010 align:middle line:10%
is no afterlife, simply
because whenever we look

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:27.710 align:middle line:10%
at the evidence, the evidence
all hangs together consistently

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:29.510 align:middle line:10%
and proves the case.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.780 align:middle line:10%
If the opposing
counsel would simply

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:36.120 align:middle line:10%
look at the evidence
with an open mind,

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.450 align:middle line:10%
we would not be even
having this discussion.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.120 align:middle line:84%
There's no
alternative conclusion

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.540 align:middle line:84%
that can be drawn from the
evidence before the court.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One day, I'll
see you in the afterlife,

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.290 align:middle line:90%
not too soon, I hope.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:50.936 align:middle line:84%
But we can at least look at
each other and go, uh-huh.

00:39:50.936 --> 00:39:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: [LAUGHS]

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were right.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIMES: That's the first
thing my mother said to me when

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.030 align:middle line:90%
I talked to her after she died.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:58.100 align:middle line:84%
She never believed
me when she was here.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roberta, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIMES: Oh, thanks.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I've had so much fun
with you, George.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:03.558 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, as
we've talked about,

00:40:03.558 --> 00:40:07.400 align:middle line:84%
we're not in a rush to get
to the other side at all.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.920 align:middle line:10%
But it's pretty sobering
to understand that

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.230 align:middle line:10%
after listening to this
show and watching it,

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.650 align:middle line:10%
that it does exist.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.710 align:middle line:10%
And that should give
you some comfort.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:20.740 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Hi, this is George Noory.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for joining me
on another mind-bending season

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.310 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And stay tuned for
the next all-new

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:31.240 align:middle line:90%
season starting in March.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.450 align:middle line:10%
Until then, here are some of
my favorite "Beyond Belief"

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:36.550 align:middle line:10%
episodes from past seasons.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:38.800 align:middle line:10%
And there are always
new, original shows

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.064 align:middle line:10%
to enjoy, only on Gaia.
