00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.900 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:10%
And our special guest in this
program is Stephen Bassett.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Stephen for years
has been trying

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.670 align:middle line:84%
to get the government to
disclose the truth about UFOs.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And he has put together
an organization called

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:90%
the Paradigm Research Group.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.680 align:middle line:90%
I have known Stephen since 1997.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Gosh, we go back a long way.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.117 align:middle line:84%
Those were my St.
Louis Nighthawk days.

00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: And we're still here.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we're still here.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Isn't that wonderful?

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Still trying to
get the answer to this.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Trying to get the
truth from the government, yes.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.726 align:middle line:84%
That's rather
difficult, it seems.

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why is it difficult?

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Because increasingly,
in this particular period

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:10%
starting after World
War II, the government

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:10%
started to see the
advantages of secrecy

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:10%
and propaganda,
misrepresentations, disinfo,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:10%
all of that stuff.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.436 align:middle line:84%
They were doing
it on the Russians

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
so they decided to
do it on us too.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And what we've seen,
and it's dangerous,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:84%
is the rise of what I
call institutional lying.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: It's one thing--

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With
everything, Stephen.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well once
you go institutional,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:90%
everything is in the thing.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing for a politician
to lie during the campaign.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.541 align:middle line:84%
They make promises they can't
keep and so forth and so forth.

00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:26.450 align:middle line:90%
We understand it.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.770 align:middle line:10%
But when it rises to
the institutional level,

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:10%
that's dangerous.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:10%
That's dangerous
for the republic.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:10%
During the Cold War, I get it.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:10%
Since the Cold War,
it's not acceptable.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest, I guess
you could say lie of all,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:84%
the biggest secret,
well, not secret,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:84%
but the biggest piece
of information of all

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:90%
is, of course, the ET presence.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Which is being withheld under
what I call the truth embargo.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.159 align:middle line:90%
Why are they hiding it?

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: It was
a national security

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:90%
matter from the get-go.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And at the time they
had a tough decision.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:84%
They had a crashed
vehicle in Roswell.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:90%
They had sightings everywhere.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.516 align:middle line:90%
Something was happening.

00:02:01.516 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:84%
They knew about
the foo fighters.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.098 align:middle line:84%
There might have even been
a crash at Cape Girardeau,

00:02:05.098 --> 00:02:05.920 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.472 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't out,
wasn't a problem.

00:02:07.472 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:90%
And then suddenly here it is.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, by the time of
Roswell in July of '47,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:84%
they knew the Russians had
the atomic and hydrogen bombs.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.774 align:middle line:90%
Testing was going to take place.

00:02:18.774 --> 00:02:20.439 align:middle line:84%
They obviously were
working on missiles.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
They had their own
German scientists.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I think these are
very smart and very tough

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:84%
people back in '47 in the
government, the military.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing another war
and it's going to be nuclear.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:90%
And they're deeply concerned.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.479 align:middle line:90%
Meanwhile, they've got ETs.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the thinking
was clearly look,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to allow this
ET thing to get out there.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
We must contain this
until we know more.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
What it can mean and
where it's going.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:90%
What do these ETs want?

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:84%
What about the
technology we have?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And when things sort out
with the Soviet Union,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.985 align:middle line:90%
maybe we'll go there OK.

00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:52.785 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:55.035 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: They couldn't
have known at '47 that it was

00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:90%
going to be a 44-year Cold War.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:10%
They we're going to spend
trillions of dollars

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:10%
and ultimately build
75,000 nuclear weapons.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know that.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And the threat would
grow with each passing

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
year until we were
seconds from death.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And so essentially
the ET thing had

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
to continue to be contained
throughout that 44 years.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And so by 1991, it was
fully institutionalized,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and they had kept
it for so long.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And now ending
that truth embargo

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:90%
was not going to be easy.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.195 align:middle line:90%
A huge public relations problem.

00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After all these
years, that's right.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: But they
had the right guy.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that they were ready to
do it under George H.W. Bush.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:90%
The Cold War was over.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:10%
He was the perfect president
to represent this issue

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:10%
and make sure that the interest
of the national security state

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.107 align:middle line:10%
were met given his
background and everything.

00:03:42.107 --> 00:03:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But even though the
Cold War was over,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
he was tied up
with the Gulf War.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big deal.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:90%
And so it wasn't.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So they figured, we'll
do it in his second term.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:84%
We'll do it in his second term,
but there wasn't a second term.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And the opposite of George H.W.
Bush turned up, Bill Clinton.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:10%
And he was hated by the
military-intelligence complex.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:10%
And they absolutely
had no intention

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.752 align:middle line:10%
of letting him be the
disclosure president.

00:04:04.752 --> 00:04:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So when Rockefeller
showed up at his door

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
wanting him to be the
disclosure president,

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:84%
all hell broke loose,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.220 align:middle line:90%
A story that needs to be told.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:84%
And a lot was done to make damn
sure that disclosure did not

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:90%
take place under Clinton.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there is disclosure,
how will it be announced?

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well you
know I've said--

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
you've done scenarios.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Oh yeah, sure, sure.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
a thousand ways.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But I'm putting my money
down on one basic approach

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.709 align:middle line:90%
which I feel good about.

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is assuming it's the
President of the United States.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Now if you talk about
another head of state--

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At any time.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Yeah, it
could happen any time.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.260 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm the president
of the United States

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and the Pentagon
and the White House

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.796 align:middle line:84%
have finally come
together and come up

00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
with an understanding
of how to move forward.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And a plan.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Which has to happen.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Because right now
the president is not

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:90%
briefed on this issue, period.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I would set it for
a Friday night,

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:84%
not because I'm trying to avoid
the news cycle, in a sense.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.705 align:middle line:90%
We'd be about 9 o'clock.

00:04:58.705 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before my Coast
to Coast radio show.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Absolutely.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.856 align:middle line:90%
And big show that night.

00:05:02.856 --> 00:05:05.105 align:middle line:84%
You'll be calling people up
at the last minute going--

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'll be on.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: You
gotta get out there.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So they get people already
home from work in California

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:90%
at 9:00.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Very last minute, the networks
will have almost no notice.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And the president will
step out in the hall,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the hall
there in the East Wing

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:84%
to the reporters
who've been called in,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:90%
don't know what it's about.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:90%
And he will--

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.546 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'll think it's
North Korea or something

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: It could
be anything like that.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Because this is not
something you can just

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.386 align:middle line:84%
leak out in advance, you
know, and let people chew on.

00:05:35.386 --> 00:05:36.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You just do it.

00:05:36.385 --> 00:05:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And come out and
say, look, and he'd either--

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:90%
or she, whatever, whoever it is.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.545 align:middle line:84%
He will either literally come
out and say, look, I'm here

00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
tonight to tell you
something very important.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.003 align:middle line:84%
There is an
extraterrestrial presence.

00:05:48.003 --> 00:05:48.916 align:middle line:90%
Don't be concerned.

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.290 align:middle line:84%
You have no reason
to be alarmed,

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:84%
but we have not been able
to tell you this until now.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Or he may take a
different approach.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is come out and say, I
have very important information

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.856 align:middle line:90%
to tell you this evening.

00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:84%
You need to know two
things about that.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.896 align:middle line:84%
And that is, it's
fully authorized

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.820 align:middle line:90%
by myself and the White House.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.742 align:middle line:84%
And that you should
do not be concerned

00:06:10.742 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
about what you are going
to learn this evening.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.145 align:middle line:90%
And that would be about it.

00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they would cut
to a press conference

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:90%
that has been set up elsewhere.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A-ha.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Where experts are.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Where eight
or nine individuals who

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
sort of represent
a cross-section

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:84%
of American society have
already-- well, they've

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:84%
been brought in on last notice
with no warning and last minute

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.452 align:middle line:84%
kind of told, you got
25 minutes to come up

00:06:29.452 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:90%
with some thoughtful remarks.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are those
people already

00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:90%
in the know that would be on?

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: It's
possible that they--

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
"in the know" meaning some
of those people probably

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.260 align:middle line:84%
already know there's
an ET presence,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean they were briefed.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.320 align:middle line:90%
They just sort of know.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Some might not know.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:90%
But then they go there.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the moderator
would be selected

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.512 align:middle line:84%
who would moderate
this press conference.

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And that moderator
would be the one

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that makes the actual
formal announcement.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.048 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
allow the press

00:06:53.048 --> 00:06:55.790 align:middle line:84%
to interview these cross-section
of high-level people

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:84%
to get their
thoughts, all of which

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:84%
will be about making
people feel OK.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.976 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they provide
to us videos and graphics

00:07:02.976 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Let's just
say that they're probably

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:84%
almost certainly going to
bring out some government

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:90%
evidence, OK.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:10%
I don't think they're
just going to hold up

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.214 align:middle line:10%
a couple of Stan
Friedman's books

00:07:13.214 --> 00:07:14.810 align:middle line:10%
and say it's all here, right.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.610 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you know.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.460 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
They'll say look,
and just to make sure

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.645 align:middle line:84%
that you understand that we're
serious, here's some video,

00:07:22.645 --> 00:07:24.020 align:middle line:84%
here is some
information we have.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Steve,
how do they explain

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.982 align:middle line:90%
the deceit over all these?

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: National security.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Look again, it's
what I said before.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
The nuclear threat, the Cold
War situation was extreme.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
We were facing
complete annihilation.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.370 align:middle line:90%
The ET issue is also extreme.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think anybody
within the military-intelligence

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.380 align:middle line:84%
complex or at least
certainly not enough

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:84%
were going to come together
and agree it's OK now.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.880 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
We almost had nuclear
war three or four times.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, exactly.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And so it
was just locked down.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
serious matter, too.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't just
oh, they can't see

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:84%
the ET thing confirmed because
we'll have to talk about it.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
If the ET thing is confirmed,
the unintended consequences

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
could create a
problem between us

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and the other
nuclear power that's

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:90%
got those missiles aimed at us.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And so if you were
inside government

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and you're thinking, you
know, it's time the New York

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Times knew about this ET
stuff, I got some photos here I

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.254 align:middle line:84%
think I'll take them
down, you probably

00:08:21.254 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't get out
of your driveway.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.586 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: It was serious.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But that changes when
the Cold War ends

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and the door finally
opens for the world

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.880 align:middle line:84%
to know the truth
either from the United

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:90%
States or another country.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is it
was institutionalized,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't been
able to pull it off.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
And so in that 26
years since the end

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:84%
of the Cold War, what you've
seen is that the truth of this

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:90%
is just bubbling up everywhere.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.788 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of
developments recently

00:08:46.788 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:90%
I'll talk about tonight.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:90%
But it's everywhere.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:90%
It's coming out everywhere.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're going, oh my
god, what are we going to do?

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do, right?

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And so now it's getting
to be ridiculous.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And but the politics has
degraded in the United States.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've been talking
about this for 27 years.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:02.448 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you have.

00:09:02.448 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Since
1964, we have been

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:84%
seeing a degradation of the
American political system

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and other instruments becoming
dysfunctional, broad spectrum

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:90%
dysfunction.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the
effects of that now.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:90%
We're a mess.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:10%
Things are not good.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:90%
And so that didn't help.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Because in order for
this event to take place,

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:84%
which will be easily
the most profound event

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:90%
in human history--

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No doubt.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: --it would be good
if we had our house in order.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got all
these factions infighting

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:90%
and whatever and partisanship.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.392 align:middle line:84%
And the politicians are
tremendously in disrepute.

00:09:39.392 --> 00:09:40.850 align:middle line:84%
You've got a Congress
for years who

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:84%
has had an approval rating
running between 11% and 16%.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Presidents are being ripped
to pieces, whoever they are.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And then primarily
men and some women

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:84%
in the military-intelligence
complex are sitting there

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.767 align:middle line:90%
watching this and going--

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scratching their heads.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.808 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: --I don't
think they're ready.

00:09:56.808 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't think-- we're
worried about this.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Now keep in mind that
keeping something

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.127 align:middle line:84%
like the extraterrestrial
presence information

00:10:05.127 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and research and everything
else away from the president

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.359 align:middle line:90%
is treason.

00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:09.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a violation of
the Constitution.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they do that.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well, they do it
for national security reasons.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.692 align:middle line:90%
They feel that they have to.

00:10:13.692 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:90%
But ultimately, it's treason.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a real problem.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:84%
I call it a
constitutional breach.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.423 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Treason
is-- let's just say

00:10:19.423 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:90%
it's well-intentioned treason.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.051 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a real
problem for them.

00:10:23.051 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Need to know treason.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.485 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And when you
have-- and by the way,

00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:84%
one of the other
things Americans

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.230 align:middle line:84%
seem to be concerned about
is the ET issue is not

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.865 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that's
been taken black.

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:33.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, our
military-intelligence complex--

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, everything else.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: --that is
kept from the president,

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:90%
kept from the Congress.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Space Program.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.031 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: There's a lot
of stuff going on there.

00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:41.240 align:middle line:84%
All of this comes under
constitutional breach.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons that
ultimately Carter, Clinton,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and Obama, I'm talking about
Bill Clinton and Obama, who

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:84%
realized they didn't go any
further is they realized,

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
if I really want to go after
this issue, which I believe

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:84%
is true, I'm going to have to
literally close that breach.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to literally
confront that breach.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.946 align:middle line:84%
And meaning the American people
are going to find out that

00:11:02.946 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:84%
the MIC, military-industrial
complex--

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:84%
oh actually, they call
it military intelligence.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.353 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't
want to go there.

00:11:08.353 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And that is a
giant dumpster truck of worms.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And so they're thinking,
I got enough trouble.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that breach is what
ultimately prevents it

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:84%
from happening, no matter what
the president may want to do.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying
the last president

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.670 align:middle line:84%
I think that could
very well have

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:90%
pulled this off was H.W. Bush.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
was is that first of all,

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:34.820 align:middle line:90%
it was early, right.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't have 26 more years
of this silly truth embargo.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And if any president was going
to be able to sort of convey

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.730 align:middle line:84%
to the people and sort of deal
with the constitutional breach

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.790 align:middle line:84%
issue and what's been withheld,
it would have been H.W. Bush.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And he would have made sure
that the military-intelligence

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:84%
complex got a fair hearing
in the public arena.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:90%
After that, not so much.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:90%
All right, you see?

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And so again, it is a
very difficult situation.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately it
comes down to this.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:84%
If the advocacy movement can
create a story so intense

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
that it literally forces the
White House and the Pentagon

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
to come together and at least
close that breach temporarily

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:84%
so the president can go
forward and announce this,

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:90%
that is how we get disclosure.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:90%
And we came that close.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That close.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Because of the
PRG's political initiative

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:84%
in the last
presidential campaign.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did a
great job with that.

00:12:29.775 --> 00:12:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: His story
is not known, George.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Almost no one knows the
story behind the scenes

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:90%
of what took place.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
They saw the articles; they
saw Hillary Clinton on Kimmel.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.380 align:middle line:84%
They saw Obama on
Kimmel, her husband

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:84%
on Kimmel and on
Ellen DeGeneres.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
They saw what she was saying
in interviews, all of which

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.000 align:middle line:84%
most people should
have gone, what?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.165 align:middle line:84%
This has never
happened before, ever.

00:12:52.165 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Came that close.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.291 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: They were
under so much pressure

00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
from so many reporters, that
while they wouldn't answer

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
any question, they stonewalled
everybody, including the New

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.734 align:middle line:90%
York Times.

00:13:00.734 --> 00:13:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew if they
got that discussion going,

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:90%
it was coming out.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.581 align:middle line:84%
And if it did, well
Barack Obama would've

00:13:05.581 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:90%
been the disclosure president.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Which is what I wanted.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
weren't ready for that.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.830 align:middle line:90%
You wanted that?

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: I wanted that.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, she wanted it.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.727 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it was like
we can't just say nothing,

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:90%
we've got to do something.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.601 align:middle line:84%
And so they're making
all these statements.

00:13:17.601 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
They're laying the
breadcrumbs, right.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But they're hoping that
it'll hang in there,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:84%
the truth embargo will hold
until I'm in the White House

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be the disclosure
president, first woman

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.121 align:middle line:90%
president, hell of a legacy.

00:13:29.121 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:90%
This is a little self-serving.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And I sent e-mails to
Podesta about that, very clear.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.940 align:middle line:10%
If she doesn't
engage the ET issue,

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:10%
she could lose this election.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:10%
And what happened was is
that all of the debates

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.062 align:middle line:10%
were run by television
journalists, right.

00:13:45.062 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Those talk show journalists--

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody
asked the question.

00:13:47.215 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Very wealthy
people, by the way.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.410 align:middle line:90%
I researched it.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.570 align:middle line:90%
They're all millionaires.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.111 align:middle line:84%
They make between
$1 and $20 million.

00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:84%
They had control
of the questions

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.999 align:middle line:84%
and all of the 36
debates and forums.

00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it is.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.505 align:middle line:90%
They control it.

00:13:57.505 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:84%
They could ask
anything they wanted.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.908 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Did they
ask a single question

00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:90%
of her or any other candidate?

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, no.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.788 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Even though
the story was written up

00:14:04.788 --> 00:14:06.340 align:middle line:90%
in 400, 500 papers?

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.450 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.046 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to find out why.

00:14:09.046 --> 00:14:10.420 align:middle line:84%
But when those
questions were not

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:84%
asked, the Podesta campaign
that he was running figured out,

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:90%
I think we've made it.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We got through it.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.508 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: We got through it.

00:14:18.508 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Bassett has done all he can.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.405 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't get
the debate going.

00:14:21.405 --> 00:14:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Because they know
what I'm doing.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
They follow
everything I'm doing.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:90%
We're there.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.607 align:middle line:84%
And so the last thing
they said on the ET issue

00:14:27.607 --> 00:14:30.190 align:middle line:84%
during that campaign, it was the
12th time they had brought it

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:84%
up, significantly was
the Code Conference

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.970 align:middle line:90%
in Rancho Palos Verdes.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which was?

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: $6,500 a
person conference.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a high tech conference
and Podesta was there.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:90%
And he talked about it.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
They asked him and he brought
it up and mentioned the things

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:90%
he'd said before.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
last thing they said.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.872 align:middle line:90%
And then they went on to lose.

00:14:47.872 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you talk about
presidential candidates,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember the day Ronald Reagan
addressed the United Nations.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:55.917 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yes.

00:14:55.917 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RONALD REAGAN: In our
obsession with antagonisms

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:84%
of the moment, we often
forget how much unites

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:90%
all the members of humanity.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps we need some
outside universal threat

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:10%
to make us recognize
this common bond.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:17.500 align:middle line:10%
I occasionally think how quickly
our differences worldwide

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.310 align:middle line:10%
would vanish if we were
facing an alien threat

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.224 align:middle line:10%
from outside this world.

00:15:23.224 --> 00:15:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
he mean by that?

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: He said
that more than once.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And the
people that were

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.304 align:middle line:84%
sort of writing his material
were a little perplexed, OK.

00:15:32.304 --> 00:15:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wanted
that in there, right?

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: He wanted it in.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:84%
He was sticking
it in on his own.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And I believe I know what
happened, but I can't prove it.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And it'll take some major
research to confirm this.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I believe that Ronald Reagan
was tipped off about the ET

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:84%
presence as part
of the SDI program

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.820 align:middle line:84%
when they were trying
to sell it to him.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:10%
They wanted him to push the SDI
Strategic Defense Initiative.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:58.110 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that that SDI
program had a Soviet component,

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:10%
but an ET component as well.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.670 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, we need
to defend ourselves

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:90%
against Soviet threat.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.139 align:middle line:84%
And you know by the way Ronnie,
you hear about those ETs?

00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You need
to know about this.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: It's true.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying
they briefed him.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.903 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I got to
tell you this, though.

00:16:11.903 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Michael Reagan is a friend
of mine, the president's son.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Right.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he told
me back 10 years ago he

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:84%
said, my dad, George, was really
interested in investigating

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yeah.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.375 align:middle line:90%
Because again, I think--

00:16:26.375 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
gave him a briefing.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they--

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.470 align:middle line:84%
if you remember Ron, he
let the pros do the job.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they would have said you
know, Mr. President, you know,

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:37.765 align:middle line:90%
the ET thing is real.

00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:39.973 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that's kind
of part of the reason why

00:16:39.973 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:90%
we want the SDI.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And his attitude was oh
wow, that's incredible.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
But he's not going to say
now I want to see everything.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:90%
No, you guys run it.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just do it.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: OK.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And so now what
happened was, of course,

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.209 align:middle line:84%
is when the SDI comes out,
the scientists went crazy.

00:16:52.209 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:84%
They looked at it and they
said, this won't work.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:84%
This will not work against
the Soviet rockets.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Not going to happen.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:90%
And Sagan was saying this.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.140 align:middle line:90%
And so, but Reagan stood firm.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:90%
He would not relent.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
obsessed with it.

00:17:04.675 --> 00:17:07.599 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Because he knew
about the ET component, right.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And he also knew the
ET thing was real.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And he was kind of
the kind of guy--

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why they were
going to build this thing.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.296 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And so he
kept bringing it up

00:17:15.296 --> 00:17:16.420 align:middle line:90%
because of that connection.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:84%
I believe that is
the background story.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Now let me add one
important caveat.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think ETs
are a threat, George.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that tried
to sell that to Ron

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
was probably way
ahead of their skis.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Let me go further.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:90%
The ETs better not be a threat.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I can
assure you, there is

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:84%
nothing we could put in
space, nothing we could

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.720 align:middle line:90%
do that would save our fanny.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: We would be toast.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, I agree.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: If you know
enough about physics--

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and I know enough about physics,
and perhaps you do as well,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:84%
to know what it means to be
able to do interstellar travel

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and where you are
technologically

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and what you can
do if you have it.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are way advanced.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.725 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: We have no chance.

00:17:55.725 --> 00:17:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now I
can understand why

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.641 align:middle line:84%
some military would
go yeah, we still

00:17:58.641 --> 00:18:00.331 align:middle line:84%
should have some
kind of defense.

00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So now we've heard
about the space command

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to militarize space.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Mostly-- I'm sure that's
all pretty much directed

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.755 align:middle line:90%
at our quote "foreign enemies."

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But probably inside there
there's some people going yeah,

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:90%
maybe we can do an ET thing.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:90%
But that was Ron being Ron.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not surprised at all
that his son knows that he was

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.680 align:middle line:90%
interested in investigating it.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.687 align:middle line:90%
But as it happens again, the--

00:18:25.687 --> 00:18:26.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That powers that be.

00:18:26.895 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: --the president
does not have the access.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And the breach
was not closeable.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's just one of
many presidential stories.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.101 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of connections
between presidents.

00:18:37.101 --> 00:18:39.637 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, some presidents
though were told, like Nixon.

00:18:39.637 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Nixon was given
some level of briefing.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They let
him in on this.

00:18:43.095 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: If the Gleason
story, Jackie Gleason story

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:84%
is true, even had access to
some of the material, maybe even

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:90%
the bodies.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And Gleason said, and this
has never been disproven.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's at Homestead.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.610 align:middle line:90%
Tell us that story.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And his
wife confirmed it.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.719 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gleason's wife.

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Jackie Gleason, who
knew Reagan and they played

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:10%
golf together asked
him, you know--

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Knew Nixon.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Asked Nixon, rather.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Nixon knew that the Gleason
had this huge UFO library

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:90%
and he was totally into it.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.379 align:middle line:84%
And he'd ask him about it
when they were playing golf.

00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:12.747 align:middle line:84%
And one day Richard Nixon,
President Nixon said,

00:19:12.747 --> 00:19:13.830 align:middle line:90%
let me show you something.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get in the car.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And Gleason
talked about this.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:84%
He talked about it
to Shirley MacLaine.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:10%
Shirley MacLaine confirmed
this to me personally.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.635 align:middle line:10%
So there's another example.

00:19:22.635 --> 00:19:24.135 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, the
story is, though,

00:19:24.135 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:10%
that Nixon took Jackie Gleason
to Homestead Air Force Base

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.900 align:middle line:10%
in Florida.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Yeah,
showed him a body.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nixon was
driving the car.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.808 align:middle line:84%
He's the president,
he's driving the car.

00:19:33.808 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:84%
The guy at the gate goes oh
my god, it's the president.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Lets them in.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and shows them an
alien like in a--

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.636 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: A dead alien.

00:19:43.636 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --in a
jar, a dead alien.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.715 align:middle line:84%
And apparently Jackie
Gleason was in shock.

00:19:47.715 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: I'm sure he was.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.298 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the guy
at the gate didn't

00:19:50.298 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:84%
know what the president
was taking him to do.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why they were there.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: I mean,
he didn't know.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.781 align:middle line:84%
So it's like OK, the president
is going to be able to get in.

00:19:56.781 --> 00:19:59.822 align:middle line:84%
And once he gets in, so he was
having a little fun that night.

00:19:59.822 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is, you know, if it
wasn't about extraterrestrials

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.821 align:middle line:84%
and the world wasn't
in the situation

00:20:03.821 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:90%
it is, it's all kind of funny.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But for those that want
to know the full story,

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:84%
most of everything we
know about the connection

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
between presidents
and this issue

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:90%
is the work of Grant Cameron.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:90%
And that is presidentialUFO.com.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:90%
He's a Canadian.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you're right.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.340 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: And he did a
tremendous service for us.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:20.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good job.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Huge amount
of material there,

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:10%
including a great deal
about the Clinton connection

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:10%
to the Rockefeller initiative.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
dance that's been

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:84%
going on between the
Pentagon and the president

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:90%
and the public and the media.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's just here,
there, and whatever.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's no longer--

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.560 align:middle line:90%
I think the music needs to stop.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.209 align:middle line:84%
We've been playing
musical chairs

00:20:42.209 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:84%
on this issue for 70 years,
including presidents.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pulling out the chair.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: The
music needs to stop.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:90%
This is too serious.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And the implications
not only of this reality,

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:84%
but the sequestered
technologies that they

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.350 align:middle line:84%
have been working on and
re-engineering for 70 years,

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.020 align:middle line:84%
they're not available
to the public domain.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Anti-gravitic repulsion
is not available to us.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And the energy system in
those craft is not available.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.656 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to learn
enough about it to know,

00:21:07.656 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:84%
if that technology
were brought out

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.235 align:middle line:84%
we could solve some
major problems.

00:21:11.235 --> 00:21:12.068 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:21:12.068 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: The kinds of problems
that stop terrorism and wars.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:90%
But the truth embargo remains.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.799 align:middle line:84%
And that technology
must be sequestered,

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.340 align:middle line:84%
because if they
brought it out they'd

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.150 align:middle line:90%
know the truth embargo ends.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Steve, let's go
back to almost the beginning

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:84%
of UFO research and
investigations with Project

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Blue Book.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yes.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> My job was to learn
how to deal with code.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And in the process
of dealing with that

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:84%
through military
maneuvers, I learned a lot

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.760 align:middle line:90%
about Project Blue Book.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Blue Book was discussed
quite openly in the office.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Sections of Blue Book
we're open for discussion.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And then there were other
matters as well that

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:90%
were brought to our attention.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.540 align:middle line:84%
One afternoon when we were
just about ready to finish up

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:13.040 align:middle line:84%
training, it was about 3:30,
maybe 3:45 in the afternoon.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Holabird
brought out a piece

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:84%
of what appeared
to be a metallic,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:84%
it was a metallic piece
of looked like about a--

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.570 align:middle line:90%
looked like a yardstick.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:84%
It had deciphering, it
had encryption on it.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And the encryption was pointed
out by Colonel Holabird

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.050 align:middle line:84%
to each one of us who
were in that class.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think there were six
or seven of us at that time.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was told to us
where that came from.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:59.269 align:middle line:84%
And this was in connection
with Operation Blue Book.

00:22:59.269 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:84%
What they were trying
to say is look,

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:84%
we've got this
physical information,

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:90%
this physical property.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And to go along with what
you've seen in Blue Book,

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:84%
we have now been able to get
our hands on and show you

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.590 align:middle line:90%
materially.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.675 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he did.

00:23:18.675 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: That would have been
part of the classified evidence

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that Blue Book obviously
was dealing with as well.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.097 align:middle line:90%
Then there is the public story.

00:23:26.097 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:84%
By the way, remember I mentioned
about how things are bubbling

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.190 align:middle line:90%
up and still happening, right?

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep, yep.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.460 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Just
a couple of weeks

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:10%
ago, Robert Zemeckis,
who's a big shot producer.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Director in
his production company.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:84%
It was announced that he had
sold the History Channel only

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:90%
its fourth scripted series.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:90%
There are three others.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.070 align:middle line:10%
The best known is "Vikings,"
which is superb, right.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:10%
I've been watching "Vikings."

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, they do
everything well on there.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: So what is the
fourth scripted series

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.206 align:middle line:84%
going to be on the
History Channel

00:23:52.206 --> 00:23:54.755 align:middle line:84%
with the production values
of a Roberts Zemeckis?

00:23:54.755 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Blue Book.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about that?

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.250 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: It is a series
on Blue Book with J. Allen

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:10%
Hynek a major feature.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:10%
So Dr. Hynek is finally
going to get his due.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Somebody will
play Hynek's role, I guess?

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Now you
think that Zemeckis

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:84%
is doing that because eh, he
knows the ET thing is all just

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.820 align:middle line:84%
a fantasy, but let's just
do a series on Blue Book.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you, the high
end people in Washington--

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody
has gotten to him.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: These
people are wealthy.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.342 align:middle line:90%
They're heavily connected.

00:24:18.342 --> 00:24:19.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, there
are people lined up

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:90%
that want to tell them things.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not saying that
Steven Spielberg has been given

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.630 align:middle line:84%
a full tour of our
underground facilities

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.317 align:middle line:84%
and research labs on ET
stuff, but he's tipped off.

00:24:30.317 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:90%
He knows there's an ET presence.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:84%
They all know there's
an ET presence, right.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.817 align:middle line:84%
And so they're doing movies and
features and making fortunes.

00:24:36.817 --> 00:24:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
have too many things

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:90%
in the movies that make sense.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Absolutely.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.882 align:middle line:90%
And so that just happened.

00:24:42.882 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you some other
things that just happened.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a great thing
for people in your field.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.606 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Two more
things just happened

00:24:49.606 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:90%
and a blockbuster, all right.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:10%
Matthew Bellamy, who is the
head guy of the supergroup Muse

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:10%
told a story.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:10%
He said, I believe
I'm an abductee.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:90%
I had a sighting.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I had a full day
of missing time.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:90%
And I think I'm an abductee.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And Muse, and this is
notable, because Muse--

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and I think he wrote this song,
came out with a song about

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:84%
eight or nine years ago
called "Exo-politics."

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It starts off with "When
the Zetas fill the sky."

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:90%
So that's Matthew Bellamy.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:24.100 align:middle line:10%
A gentleman by the name of
Rupert Matthews in the UK,

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.140 align:middle line:10%
who has written a half
a dozen serious books

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:10%
on the extraterrestrial
issue, including abduction,

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.155 align:middle line:10%
was just elected to
the House of Commons.

00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something you
tried to do years ago.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: He's a
member of Parliament.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Didn't create a problem for him.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
But then here's the
big one, all right,

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and why I'm so glad I'm
doing this show right now.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:90%
And this is a major event.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.340 align:middle line:84%
It may be the biggest event
in the disclosure process--

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever.

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: --and the
advocacy since the citizen

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.070 align:middle line:90%
hearing in 2013.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:10%
Robert Bigelow founded
an organization

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:10%
to investigate this
phenomenon in 1995,

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:10%
three years before he actually
launched Bigelow Aerospace.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: So he's already
investigating this issue

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.170 align:middle line:84%
through a group called the
National Institute of Discovery

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Science with some high level
people on it and a board

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But then he gets into the
aerospace thing in 1998,

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.790 align:middle line:90%
all right.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:84%
He has a dream; he wants
to put habitats in space.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:20.332 align:middle line:90%
He's quite serious.

00:26:20.332 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:90%
And he's a billionaire.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Floating hotel.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: In 2000-- I think
it was 2000 or early 2001,

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.740 align:middle line:84%
he got the chance to
make his big move.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Because NASA had to-- during
that dot.com implosion,

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.620 align:middle line:90%
funding went down.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.879 align:middle line:84%
They had to cut that program
on flexible habitats.

00:26:36.879 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:84%
He bought all the rights and
engaged in NASA contracts.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's doing it himself.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And now even though
he was into the ET issue, which

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure made a lot of people
at NASA a little nervous,

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.138 align:middle line:84%
you know, but hey, he's
going to put the money in it.

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:90%
He's going to do it.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So he buys the rights and starts
putting millions of dollars

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:90%
into research in space habitats.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:90%
NIDS remains open until 2004.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Later on, he gets involved
in MUFON for a while,

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:84%
doing some research,
put some money in there.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:90%
NASA, no problem, no problem.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, probably
because again, you know,

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:84%
he's not pressing
us politically.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And he's putting
all his money in.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:10.370 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Now another eight,
nine years go by.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:90%
He's put $300 million in.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:90%
And finally--

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: His own money.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.546 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Of his own money.

00:27:17.546 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the first
major breakthrough

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:84%
for Robert Bigelow
of Las Vegas comes

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.480 align:middle line:84%
when NASA agrees to test one
of his inflatable habitats

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.260 align:middle line:90%
on the Space Station.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.910 align:middle line:90%
This a big deal, right.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Naturally, it's
also worthy of a "60 Minutes"

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:33.740 align:middle line:90%
interview.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.810 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: And so OK,
because they're inflating it,

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.309 align:middle line:10%
they're putting it
up there, they're

00:27:38.309 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:10%
going to interview him on this.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.019 align:middle line:84%
And the interview
occurred on May 28.

00:27:42.019 --> 00:27:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Now I know enough about
these interviews to know.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.180 align:middle line:84%
What was done is he was
provided the general topics.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.717 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't given the questions.

00:27:48.717 --> 00:27:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And he certainly didn't provide
"60 Minutes" the answers

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:90%
to anything in advance.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.454 align:middle line:84%
But they have to
know general topics

00:27:54.454 --> 00:27:56.120 align:middle line:84%
so the person can
reflect on it and they

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:90%
have a proper interview.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And be a
little ready for it.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And so Lara, the
very nice lady named Lara Logan,

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:90%
she starts the interview.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about his
space program and his habitat

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:90%
work and the research.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they naturally,
because of his history,

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
his known history with
NIDS and so forth, she

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.326 align:middle line:84%
asked him about the
extraterrestrial issue.

00:28:11.326 --> 00:28:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LARA LOGAN: Do you
believe in aliens?

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT BIGELOW: I'm
absolutely convinced,

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.740 align:middle line:90%
that's all there is to it.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LOGAN: Do you also believe
that UFOs have come to Earth?

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELOW: There has been and
is an existing presence, an ET

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:90%
presence.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And I spent millions
and millions.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.947 align:middle line:84%
I probably spent
more as an individual

00:28:25.947 --> 00:28:27.530 align:middle line:84%
than anybody else
in the United States

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.800 align:middle line:90%
has ever spent on this subject.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: And she says, well--

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.940 align:middle line:84%
this is a standard
truth embargo response.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you concerned that
some people might think you're

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:39.600 align:middle line:90%
crazy for that?

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And then he comes
with these words.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.529 align:middle line:84%
>>LOGAN: Risky for you to say
in public that you believe in--

00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELOW: I don't give a damn.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LOGAN: --UFOs and aliens?

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELOW: I don't care.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.824 align:middle line:84%
>>LOGAN: You don't worry
that some people will say,

00:28:50.824 --> 00:28:51.770 align:middle line:90%
did you hear that guy?

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:52.900 align:middle line:90%
He sounds like he's crazy.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELOW: I don't care.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:54.701 align:middle line:90%
>>LOGAN: Why not?

00:28:54.701 --> 00:28:56.658 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELOW: It's not going
to make a difference.

00:28:56.658 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
change reality.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: What
just happened here?

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:90%
A billionaire--

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Involved in
the space program.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.916 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: --who has
put his heart and soul,

00:29:03.916 --> 00:29:06.740 align:middle line:84%
involved in the space program
with three contracts with NASA.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:10.166 align:middle line:84%
He's been a NASA contractor
since 2000, right.

00:29:10.166 --> 00:29:11.540 align:middle line:84%
He's just had the
greatest moment

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.430 align:middle line:84%
of his life in
terms of that work.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:90%
They've put it up on the ISS.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And now he's asked a question
about his ET interest,

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.475 align:middle line:84%
which he's had plenty
of time to think about.

00:29:22.475 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, could
have been denied.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well no, he
could have done anything.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he literally
lays it out there.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't
expect this answer.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Robert Bigelow is a serious man.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:90%
He knows there's an ET presence.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.920 align:middle line:84%
He put millions of dollars
into his own research.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.110 align:middle line:84%
He's not just somebody
that read a few books.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.430 align:middle line:84%
He is doing space
habitat development,

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.960 align:middle line:84%
which is applicable whether you
have any kind of propulsion.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's solid research and
can be very, very helpful.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And he knows full well that if
this truth embargo had ended

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.760 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, we'd probably
have hotels around the moon

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.560 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:84%
His work would be
fully manifest.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And so this truth embargo
is driving him crazy, right.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.430 align:middle line:90%
And finally, he had enough.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And so when given the
opportunity on one

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.941 align:middle line:84%
of the most watched
shows on television--

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Credible shows.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.981 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: One of the
oldest running shows in all

00:30:12.981 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:84%
of television, he
says flat out there's

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.344 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial presence.

00:30:16.344 --> 00:30:17.885 align:middle line:84%
And when asked if
he's worried people

00:30:17.885 --> 00:30:20.180 align:middle line:84%
will think he's crazy he
says, I don't give a damn.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:26.270 align:middle line:10%
That message was to Spielberg
and Lucas and Cameron and Musk

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:31.010 align:middle line:10%
and Bezos and Branson,
these multi-hundred million

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.870 align:middle line:10%
billionaires who have been
involved in this issue

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:34.790 align:middle line:10%
forever--

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.216 align:middle line:10%
SpaceX, movies, films.

00:30:38.216 --> 00:30:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.914 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And he's basically
saying, will you guys--

00:30:43.914 --> 00:30:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to use
the right phrase here.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.477 align:middle line:84%
Will you show a
little gumption when

00:30:47.477 --> 00:30:48.727 align:middle line:90%
you speak some truth to power?

00:30:48.727 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like I
am and jump ahead.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Yeah, because if
those gentlemen who I am sure

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:57.819 align:middle line:84%
are concerned and may
have even been told,

00:30:57.819 --> 00:30:59.110 align:middle line:90%
you know, you got a great life.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.318 align:middle line:90%
You're worth a billion bucks.

00:31:00.318 --> 00:31:01.690 align:middle line:90%
You're making great money.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to mess
with us on this issue.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Make your films,
but don't, don't

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.870 align:middle line:90%
get into the advocacy mode.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Don't go political on us.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they've been threatened.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And basically saying
it's 2017, guys.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to kidnap--

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But Bigelow
doesn't care.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: He doesn't care.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.890 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
kidnap your children.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Speak up.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And you know what would happen
if a Spielberg and a Bezos

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.770 align:middle line:84%
or a Branson were to
come out and say, look,

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:23.728 align:middle line:90%
there's an ET presence.

00:31:23.728 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I got tipped off on
that 20 years ago?

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, huge, huge.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: It would
force disclosure probably

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.360 align:middle line:90%
within a week.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly, yeah.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.456 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And it
would be a little more

00:31:30.456 --> 00:31:33.250 align:middle line:84%
chaotic than the president being
able to kind of surprise us.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.939 align:middle line:84%
It would create an
enormous firestorm.

00:31:34.939 --> 00:31:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But that's what I was trying to
do with the Clinton campaign.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.980 align:middle line:90%
And we came that close.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.744 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a major event.

00:31:41.744 --> 00:31:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And Bob Bigelow went down in
history right in that moment.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what he does
with the space research.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:90%
That event was significant.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.117 align:middle line:84%
And I hope Bob understands
what he did there.

00:31:52.117 --> 00:31:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think he knows.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.075 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: I hope so.

00:31:54.075 --> 00:31:55.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think he knows.

00:31:55.405 --> 00:31:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of Bobs, there was
another guy named Bob Lazar.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yes.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At Area
51 who has truly,

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.720 align:middle line:84%
if you believe his
story, has really

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.084 align:middle line:90%
revolutionized the UFO field.

00:32:07.084 --> 00:32:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BOB LAZAR: The
first disc I saw,

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was the
second or I think it was

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.300 align:middle line:90%
the third time I was up there.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Upon seeing it, it
struck me that well, this

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.366 align:middle line:90%
explains all the UFO sightings.

00:32:19.366 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Not thinking that it was
an extraterrestrial craft,

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that this must have been
some advanced form of fighter

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
working on for years,

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and people have
just caught it being

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.740 align:middle line:90%
tested, so on and so forth.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.236 align:middle line:84%
And it never even
occurred to me,

00:32:32.236 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:84%
even though I was looking at
an extraterrestrial vehicle,

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:37.050 align:middle line:84%
that you know, this
wasn't man made.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stephen, he
sounds like the real deal.

00:32:39.025 --> 00:32:40.483 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Oh look,
in the 20 years

00:32:40.483 --> 00:32:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I've been in this I've heard
everything come across my radar

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:84%
screen, and most
of it is nonsense.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Right now we're really
buried in nonsense.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It's coming out because
of all the excitement.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Space colonies on Mars making
it to the level of CNN.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.070 align:middle line:90%
God help, god help us.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:00.110 align:middle line:90%
And I dismiss a great deal.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I know enough to believe that
Bob Lazar's core story is true.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And he paid a heavy
price for that story.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He did.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And I hope that
Bob hangs around long enough

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:15.650 align:middle line:84%
to see the vindication of his
effort to talk about something

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:16.450 align:middle line:90%
very important.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.056 align:middle line:90%
A little ahead of time.

00:33:18.056 --> 00:33:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way ahead of time.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.013 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: I believe
when he first comes out

00:33:21.013 --> 00:33:22.350 align:middle line:90%
the Cold War is still underway.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty sure.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:24.250 align:middle line:90%
It was in the '80s, wasn't it?

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: And so he's--

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With our
colleague George Knapp.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Exactly.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.330 align:middle line:90%
And he paid a price.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.010 align:middle line:84%
After the Cold War
ends, it's different.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.320 align:middle line:84%
There has been almost no
significant harassment

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.147 align:middle line:84%
of any witnesses really
since 2002, 3, 4.

00:33:37.147 --> 00:33:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, you're right.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.500 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.708 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: But Bob was early.

00:33:39.708 --> 00:33:41.050 align:middle line:90%
He got ahead of his skis.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And all I can say is Bob, you
know, you did what you could.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Is that stuff at Area 51?

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.907 align:middle line:90%
I think they moved it long ago.

00:33:48.907 --> 00:33:49.990 align:middle line:90%
But he's not the only one.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe even before
he started talking about it

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.110 align:middle line:90%
they moved it.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Possibly.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.495 align:middle line:84%
He's not the only
one though that

00:33:55.495 --> 00:33:57.640 align:middle line:84%
has come out with information
along those lines.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
the other one is--

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about him, the
Canadian, the former Canadian

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:03.628 align:middle line:90%
Defense Minister.

00:34:03.628 --> 00:34:05.086 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Paul
Hellyer, of course.

00:34:05.086 --> 00:34:06.454 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Paul Hellyer.

00:34:06.454 --> 00:34:09.909 align:middle line:10%
>> The Honorable Paul Hellyer,
former Minister of Defense

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:10%
of Canada.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:14.500 align:middle line:10%
And he believes that
life forms from space

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.560 align:middle line:10%
exists and are present on Earth.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.630 align:middle line:10%
It's great to have you
with us on our show.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:23.770 align:middle line:10%
Why do you say that UFOs are
as real as the airplanes flying

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:10%
over our heads?

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.180 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL HELLYER: Well,
because I know that they are.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.429 align:middle line:10%
They've been, as
a matter of fact,

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:36.540 align:middle line:10%
they've been visiting our
planet for thousands of years.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What incredible
information, Stephen.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.969 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: You know, some high
level people like Admiral Lord

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:43.614 align:middle line:90%
Hill-Norton have also talked it.

00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
list of quotes you

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:48.030 align:middle line:84%
can find from pretty high
level people going back years.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:52.830 align:middle line:84%
But Paul Hellyer, former Defense
Minister of Canada, Deputy

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Prime Minister, was
brought into the issue

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.020 align:middle line:84%
by Victor Viggiani in
2005 at a presentation

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.880 align:middle line:90%
at a university in Toronto.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.930 align:middle line:90%
And I was there.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:90%
And this man is an amazing guy.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:06.660 align:middle line:90%
He's a devout Christian.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.840 align:middle line:90%
He's upright as he could be.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:90%
He's a legend in politics.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.400 align:middle line:90%
And he was like 88.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's honest.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And he
decided you know,

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.365 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get into this.

00:35:13.365 --> 00:35:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And now look, he
has tried to get up

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.199 align:middle line:84%
to speed on this
huge, vast issue.

00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And he's gotten in some areas
that probably won't necessarily

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.540 align:middle line:90%
hold up.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.350 align:middle line:90%
But the core thing was this.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:25.665 align:middle line:84%
He read the book
"After Roswell."

00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "The Day
After Roswell."

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: By Birnes and Corso.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.750 align:middle line:90%
And then he had some contacts.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.420 align:middle line:10%
He was the Defense Minister
during the Vietnam War.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.819 align:middle line:84%
He called up some
of his contacts

00:35:34.819 --> 00:35:36.360 align:middle line:84%
in the US, some of
the Army generals,

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.620 align:middle line:90%
and they confirmed it.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.436 align:middle line:84%
And that was enough for
him to go OK, damn it,

00:35:40.436 --> 00:35:41.810 align:middle line:84%
it's time these
people knew this.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:43.434 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I put
him in the category

00:35:43.434 --> 00:35:46.710 align:middle line:84%
of the Edgar Mitchells, the
late Apollo 14 astronaut.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.980 align:middle line:84%
People who are in the
know, credible people,

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.540 align:middle line:84%
who deal with people
in government,

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.600 align:middle line:90%
and they come out with stories.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And every
time one of them

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:01.366 align:middle line:90%
dies I feel a pretty big pang.

00:36:01.366 --> 00:36:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We lose something.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well, they
didn't live to see this end.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The end.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.160 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Look, when
you've got people

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:14.870 align:middle line:10%
like Edgar Mitchell and Gordon
Cooper, Jesse Marcel are gone.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:10%
And these would normally
be great heroes.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:84%
These would normally be very,
very significant people.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And they have all
been diminished

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.500 align:middle line:84%
because they touched
the ET subject

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and got tossed into
the intellectual ghetto

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.080 align:middle line:84%
that the government created
to embargo this issue.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And when great men and women
like that are demeaned,

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.310 align:middle line:84%
that should be a message to the
people in government, it's time

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:42.530 align:middle line:90%
to end this game.

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:44.420 align:middle line:90%
It is time to tell the truth.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Or we'll continue
to have to diminish

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:51.204 align:middle line:84%
great people because the
truth embargo uber all.

00:36:51.204 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So where is
disclosure heading?

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.247 align:middle line:84%
And where is Steve
Bassett heading?

00:36:55.247 --> 00:36:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Right now I'm
trying to raise the funds

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.057 align:middle line:84%
through a GoFundMe
campaign at my website

00:36:59.057 --> 00:37:00.140 align:middle line:90%
paradigmresearchgroup.org.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to continue
to push for connections

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.814 align:middle line:90%
to other countries on this.

00:37:06.814 --> 00:37:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll keep obviously
close tabs on what's

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.300 align:middle line:90%
happening the United States.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're not
going to stop, are you?

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: No.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:14.010 align:middle line:90%


00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Years ago I told
you on your show,

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and I've said it many times,
for quite a while now, certainly

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.970 align:middle line:84%
the last 26 years, we have
been living and watching

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:27.310 align:middle line:90%
a race between two clocks.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:30.000 align:middle line:84%
One is the doomsday clock, most
people know about this clock.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:30.355 --> 00:37:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: It is the
nuclear war clock.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Midnight, nuclear war.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're
getting closer and closer.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: They've
moved it twice.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They've moved it.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.716 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And the other
is the paradigm clock

00:37:37.716 --> 00:37:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that I published
back in 1998 or 1999.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.010 align:middle line:10%
And that clock has got a
different midnight on it.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.350 align:middle line:10%
It's disclosure.

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:45.460 align:middle line:10%
Disclosure, nuclear war.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.220 align:middle line:10%
And we have been
on, it's been racing

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.470 align:middle line:10%
to see which would happen first.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:54.760 align:middle line:10%
And so even though it's not the
kind of issue that's all over

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.240 align:middle line:10%
and the people are marching
in the streets about,

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.890 align:middle line:10%
it's very intellectual
and complicated.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:04.150 align:middle line:10%
Ultimately, everything I
think is at stake here.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:08.077 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure is the most important
issue in the world today.

00:38:08.077 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:84%
The ET presence is the
most important issue.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest news
story in history.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you to promise
me one thing today, Stephen.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.823 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yes, sir.

00:38:14.823 --> 00:38:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'll never give up.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: George,
if I stop doing this,

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I have to get a job.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:21.730 align:middle line:84%
That's out of the
question, right.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Keep doing what you're doing.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: I'm with
it till the end.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get the answers for us.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yes.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: My pleasure.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: UFOs, I've been
fascinated with them

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.450 align:middle line:90%
since I was a kid.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm more fascinated
with them now,

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.660 align:middle line:84%
because I have an opportunity
to interview people

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.520 align:middle line:84%
like Stephen Bassett who
are out to get the truth.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.440 align:middle line:10%
And with that, one day
we'll get the answers.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
