[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.898 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.350 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.449 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.502 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
back to another edition

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.251 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory with our
special guest, Dianne Arcangel.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you missed Dianne's
first program with me,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:84%
go back and take a look
at it because it really

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:84%
will put things into
perspective as we continue

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:84%
talking about
afterlife encounters

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and just what happens to
people who go to the other side

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and what happens to people who
have loved ones who have gone.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Bereavement-- that's a tough,
tough subject for people,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>> DIANNE ARCANGEL: It is
a tough subject, George,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:90%
but you know what?

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
It does not have to be
tough to talk about.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's the main thing
is when someone is bereaved,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:84%
it's so important to talk,
so important to find someone

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:84%
with whom we can share our
thoughts and our deepest,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:90%
deepest feelings.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have noticed
that when you go to a wake

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:84%
or to a funeral, some
people are crying.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Some people aren't.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.642 align:middle line:90%
Why the difference?

00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Oh, why the
difference of why some people

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:90%
are crying and why not goes to--

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The other ones--

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: It can be huge.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're laughing and
the Irish drink and you know,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:90%
he was a great guy.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:90%
But why that difference?

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: For
one thing, George,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:10%
we were trained-- everything--
if you think about it

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:10%
from childhood, everything
we know about life, death,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:10%
and loss goes back
to our childhood,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.300 align:middle line:10%
to the very first bird we might
found in the yard, grandma's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:10%
dog who died.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:84%
We were all taught as
children how to grieve.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.820 align:middle line:84%
For some people, we were
taught, big boys don't cry.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Uh-uh-uh, little girls
don't show their anger.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, no.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So we just keep a
stiff upper lip.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.596 align:middle line:84%
We don't cry, especially
in front of other people.

00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
a couple books out,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:84%
"Afterlife Encounters"
and "Life After Loss,"

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:84%
two different books
but two similar books.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about each one.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Yes,
"Life After Loss"

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.460 align:middle line:90%
is strictly a bereavement book.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:84%
"Life"-- "Afterlife Encounters"
is for anyone wondering what

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:90%
happens after death.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Does consciousness continue?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Where does it go?

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Who sees afterlife encounters?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Who experiences them?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Why do some people
experience them?

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Other people don't.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a friend of mine
who was reading a book on life

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:84%
after death and he was
reading it at his desk.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:90%
And he's reading.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.850 align:middle line:90%
He's into chapter 1.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:90%
He's into chapter 2.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:84%
He lives alone and it was late
at night and he got tired.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:90%
He went to bed after chapter 2.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Wakes up in the morning-- the
book is flipped to chapter 6.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:10%
And he's going,
oh, this is weird.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.130 align:middle line:90%
He lives alone.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.490 align:middle line:84%
He's the only
person in the house.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:90%
He went back to chapter 2.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:90%
We read a few more chapters.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
He read up to chapter 6, put it
away, went out for the night.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Came back-- it's now at chapter
9 and he's totally baffled.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
He and I concluded that a
loved one he knew who passed on

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:90%
was reading that book.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That could very--

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Possible?

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: It's
absolutely possible.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
he didn't flip it

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:90%
and he was telling me the truth.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: We look
for evidential things.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
There are certain things that
we look for evidence for life

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:84%
after death and one is
a physical object being

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.919 align:middle line:90%
manipulated.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.085 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: And there
you have evidence

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:54.940 align:middle line:84%
of a physical object being
manipulated as for evidence.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we believe that
they do have things to do

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and maybe for some reason,
they needed to read that book.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.183 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:01.183 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to say, why read
a book on afterlife experiences

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:90%
from the other side?

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to learn?

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: And it could be
perhaps the apparition was here

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to flip open to that page
because that's the page he

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.440 align:middle line:90%
wanted the person to focus on--

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's
a good point.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: He wanted
your friend to focus on.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.580 align:middle line:84%
You did some research with
Dean Radin, Dean an expert

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.839 align:middle line:90%
on consciousness.

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
about that because you

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.179 align:middle line:90%
don't talk too much about that.

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I don't
That is something

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:90%
I really don't talk about.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.356 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You will today.

00:04:30.356 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Dean is fantastic.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Dean is like one of my
favorite researchers.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Dean is incredible.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Any of his books--
if someone's wanting

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:84%
to read anything
on consciousness,

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Dean's books are incredible.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:84%
We were hired by the
University of UNLV.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Las Vegas, right?

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Right-- to
go in and do a study.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
We brought in I believe it
was six different people

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:90%
into a dark room.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was set up, George,
with microphones, recorders--

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
every type of recording
equipment you can think of,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Dean got.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.950 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
had one FLIR camera

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.600 align:middle line:84%
that cost $250,000 to rent
one weekend, just one weekend.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:84%
But Dean was able to
do that, brought it in.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:90%
We did the research.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.475 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, do you want to
hear a story just out of--

00:05:16.475 --> 00:05:19.277 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: We brought a medium.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.276 align:middle line:84%
We brought all different
types of people

00:05:22.276 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:84%
from all different
walks of life.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But our last person--
we wanted to see

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
what a medium would do if
we put him in this booth

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:90%
and hooked up.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.604 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to see if we
could pick up anything

00:05:31.604 --> 00:05:34.380 align:middle line:84%
on film, which we picked up
some anomalies, picked up

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:90%
some recorded anomalies.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
But we brought in
a medium and he

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.900 align:middle line:84%
was sitting in this dark
booth for us to record.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile,
everything went out

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and we had a camera on the
medium, this FLIR camera.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And when he came in, the medium
was completely color like you,

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:90%
color like me.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
He turned completely white,
George, totally white.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we
could see were two

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.360 align:middle line:84%
little black were his nostrils,
where he was breathing.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, the cameraman
who was there

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
to protect his $250,000
piece of equipment

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.835 align:middle line:90%
came running into the room.

00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:05.710 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'll fix it.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:90%
I'll fix it.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:84%
He walked into the
room and the medium

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:90%
said, oh, your uncle is here.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Your niece is here, and began
giving this man a reading.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the man was the
color, the normal color,

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
but the medium was still
there totally white.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:84%
So we said, there's
something wrong with mediums

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:84%
that they can do, it
changes their physiology.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, this medium says he's
had near-death experiences.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So he believes his psyche goes
out and contacts the deceased

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.307 align:middle line:90%
and brings it back.

00:06:38.307 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It probably does.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Could be.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.248 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, back to your
research with Radin-- what

00:06:42.248 --> 00:06:43.720 align:middle line:90%
were you trying to accomplish?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: We were trying
to get anything on film,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:84%
anything auditory
recorded so we could say,

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.594 align:middle line:84%
all right, we have this
evidential evidence,

00:06:52.594 --> 00:06:53.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, on tape.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like an EVP sound?

00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Or beyond that?

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.398 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: We did have some
of that type of it but mainly,

00:06:58.398 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:84%
we wanted it on film, something
that you could actually see.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
You could actually say,
OK, look at this image.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:90%
We got a few things.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we never
could get any more funding

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:84%
so we didn't do
any more research.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.532 align:middle line:84%
I would love to
do more with Dean.

00:07:13.532 --> 00:07:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
conclude anything?

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: We concluded
there seems to be something

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:90%
beyond this Earth.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing--
again, nothing harmful.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
No one was-- I mean,
everyone-- everyone

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
who went into this dark room
had some type of experience.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it was not an
apparition but they

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.520 align:middle line:84%
said they experienced
something unusual in-- now,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:90%
why a dark room?

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.930 align:middle line:90%
We put a dark room.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of oracles of
the dead from ancient Greece?

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: This was--
we kind of thought, well,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
if the oracles from ancient
Greece went into a dark room

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and they had
something reflecting,

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.370 align:middle line:84%
what if we made a
modern-day oracle?

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:90%
So that's what Dean and I did.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:84%
We created this
modern-day oracle.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
It was just a dark room with
a slightly reflective surface.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So we did pick up
things-- not enough

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:84%
to where we can really move
forward with it until we

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:90%
had more research.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know
Rosemary Ellen Guiley?

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:84%
She's my co-author
in the book, "Talking

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:84%
to the Dead" and a
great researcher.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
She has been researching
black mirrors.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.910 align:middle line:84%
They're black but
when you look in them,

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:84%
you generally might see the
reflection of the other side.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how
technology can pick up

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:84%
some of this, which is leading
me to understand and believe

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:39.429 align:middle line:90%
that the other side is science.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not supernatural.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:90%
It's very physical and natural.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.232 align:middle line:90%
Are you at that point yet?

00:08:46.232 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I am
at that point yet.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I am at the point of it
being science and natural.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
love about science is

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.860 align:middle line:84%
that we look for things that we
can document, that we can say,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:84%
this isn't just a
thought or a fleeting.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:84%
It's something on paper
that something is there.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.438 align:middle line:90%
It's more concrete.

00:09:03.438 --> 00:09:06.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When somebody
dies, we have always

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.150 align:middle line:84%
suspected, according
to religion,

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that they can go
to heaven or hell.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Not sure that really is the
case-- what do you think?

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Well, George,
as far as heaven and hell,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I have over 100,000
documented accounts.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth Kubler-Ross,
with whom I worked,

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:90%
had 250,000 documented accounts.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Bill Rowe, another researcher
colleague of mine, had 200,000.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.750 align:middle line:84%
We compile-- and I'm with
a group of researchers,

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.920 align:middle line:90%
50 international researchers.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:84%
We do not have any
evidence of a hell.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, there have been--

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:90%
Nothing?

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Nothing, nothing--
it's all just peace, love, joy.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what happens
to the evil person who died

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:90%
and goes to the other side?

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, aren't they punished?

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Well, this is kind
of-- from what we understand is

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.550 align:middle line:84%
that when there's evil on
Earth-- George, as you know,

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.175 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot--

00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's lots
of evil on Earth.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Terrible,
terrible evil on Earth.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: But
what-- it seems to be

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.940 align:middle line:84%
right now from the researcher--
now again, I don't know.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:84%
All I can tell you is
just what we have gathered

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:24.060 align:middle line:84%
is that when we leave here,
we leave all of that behind.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're here is
to work through the things

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.880 align:middle line:84%
that we've built up and built
up over many years of living

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.500 align:middle line:90%
and being reincarnated.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So we leave all of our
negativity behind here

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we float
up and away from here.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.250 align:middle line:90%
But all of that is left here.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:45.497 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the serial killer's
soul, what happens to it?

00:10:45.497 --> 00:10:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: And again, it just--

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it meshed in
with all the good ones?

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.685 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: It's just
because all that negativity

00:10:50.685 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that he-- that killer, that
terrorist, when he leaves here,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.793 align:middle line:90%
all that is left behind.

00:10:56.793 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hmm.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: And part of this
is what we have gathered--

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're stuck with it.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.645 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Is
that you're right.

00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:84%
We are stuck with it is
that we have had people

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
who have died by suicide
who have come back to say,

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.760 align:middle line:90%
I was so angry.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.510 align:middle line:90%
I was so, so angry.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And what I realize now
is that all of that anger

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.759 align:middle line:90%
and all of that negativity--

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That hate.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: That hate,
that's earthly stuff.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And if I had just stayed
there and worked it through,

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.250 align:middle line:84%
now I see why I had those events
happen in my life, what I was

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be working through.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Not only did I
cheat my relatives

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and my friends
and my colleagues,

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:90%
I cheated me the most.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, I realize if I had
just stuck it through what

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.230 align:middle line:90%
my life would have been like.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dianne, the Vatican
has courses on exorcisms.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So they believe that
there's evil out there,

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.900 align:middle line:90%
that there's demons out there.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know there's evil
living here on this planet

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:84%
but they're convinced
it's beyond that.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So there seems to be a little
difference between what they're

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:90%
doing and what you believe.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.455 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: That's
right, George.

00:12:11.455 --> 00:12:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And here, it goes back to
what they're doing is religion

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:90%
and what we're doing is science.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.022 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to bridge
the two, bridge the science

00:12:19.022 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:90%
and the religion.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.380 align:middle line:90%
So far, it hasn't happened.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's why when we go over
and we study these things,

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:84%
we don't get the same
outcome that they do.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't get the same
findings that they do.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
that that exorcism, trying

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to get a demon out of somebody,
that the person's just

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:84%
whacked out or is
it really happening?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Well, George,
if some of these people

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
go into, say, go into
therapy, they can find relief.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:84%
They can work with-- I mean, I
don't have the answer for sure,

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.047 align:middle line:84%
whether it's demons, whether
it's-- but just from science,

00:12:55.047 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
we know when we take these
people and we take them

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:84%
into counseling or to therapy,
they get tremendous relief.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's really they're
demonized and that helps them

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's some type
of chemical imbalance--

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.432 align:middle line:84%
maybe they have some
type of a disease.

00:13:10.432 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, there
are a lot of things

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.530 align:middle line:84%
that can happen to the brain
that gets us off-whack.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'd love to
get you to an exorcism--

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: I would, too.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.506 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Just so
you'd witness it.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:21.139 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what you'd
say afterward.

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Well,
George, I'll go with you.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Invite me and I'll go.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe I'm
going to be exorcised.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.156 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: All right.

00:13:28.156 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You never know.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I was invited to--
there was a ghost researcher,

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.500 align:middle line:90%
he called himself.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said he went out
to people who called him

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that said they had a loved one
who was trapped between worlds

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:90%
or trapped on this world.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And he invited me to go
with him and he said,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the top
research in the United States

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.035 align:middle line:90%
for these ghostly events.

00:13:49.035 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you believe him?

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Well, let me
tell you what I found.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.320 align:middle line:84%
He had never talked
to this woman.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.456 align:middle line:84%
She called and said
that her-- I believe

00:13:56.456 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
it was her husband
had been murdered

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and that he was trapped
here in her apartment.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:84%
We went out and he
immediately told her,

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
yes, he's trapped here and
we're going to put the EVP.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put the
sound equipment over here.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And so in other words,
he went in with a bias

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:84%
that the husband was trapped
and that he was going

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:90%
to put this EVP equipment.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.820 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't hear anything.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in "Afterlife
Encounters," my book,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I talked about going
to a research project

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:84%
with Bill Rowe
where we interviewed

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and we studied for
a week with someone

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:84%
who was the top EVP researcher
in the United States.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.089 align:middle line:90%
Now, he heard--

00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those are eerie.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are eerie--

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Yes.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Especially
little kids and stuff.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: And
from the five people

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:84%
who were sitting in the
room when they played back

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:84%
the types of supposedly
EVP, we each heard something

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:90%
very different.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I know when I play
it on the radio,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell
people what they're

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
going to hear because you
really can't distinguish

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of times.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.640 align:middle line:84%
But there's clearly
something there.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
You just sometimes
can't hear it.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.241 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That's right.

00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there usually
is something there.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.182 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think consciousness is?

00:15:06.182 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: I
believe consciousness

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.250 align:middle line:10%
is energy, George.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.144 align:middle line:10%
It's just energy.

00:15:13.144 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's something--

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Natural?

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: It's
a natural energy.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And that-- when your
question reminded me of,

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I get asked a lot, so is
an apparition a ghost?

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I say, no, an apparition is
very different from a ghost.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:84%
A ghost is what you're
talking-- is residual energy.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:84%
When you leave your chair, I can
bring some type of a meter over

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and I can measure
where your energy was.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
with people who are living.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.520 align:middle line:84%
After we die, our
energy is left behind.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of our energy
is left behind.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are people who are
really sensitive to energies

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and they can go and
they can see this ghost.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.070 align:middle line:90%
It takes form.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:84%
But the difference is that
the ghost never communicates.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:84%
A ghost is not interactive
and a ghost is place-oriented.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:90%
It's stay.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Say, for instance,
in your chair,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:90%
it would stay where you are.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
My chair, it will
stay where I am.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.613 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the house, whatever.

00:16:01.613 --> 00:16:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: In the house,
in the car, in the building,

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.910 align:middle line:84%
wherever, whereas an
apparition is people-oriented.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:90%
It goes with us.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:90%
It's interactive.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.294 align:middle line:90%
It will talk.

00:16:11.294 --> 00:16:12.460 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, it will touch us.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:90%
It will hug us.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's very different from
an apparition and a ghost.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you interview
people about the other side,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.431 align:middle line:90%
how do you start?

00:16:23.431 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I start with--
first of all, it's research

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and they get a
survey to fill out.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And the survey says,
were they comforted?

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.000 align:middle line:90%
To what level of comfort?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Or it goes back to another
research where it was

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.200 align:middle line:90%
with the focus on the departed.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Did the departed--
were they high-energy?

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Were they low-energy?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Were they extroverted?

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Were they introverted?

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So I begin with, where are
they and also with grief.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:84%
First of all, before I ever talk
with anyone on the afterlife,

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I need to know where
they are along.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Are they-- first of all, are
they even grief-stricken?

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.179 align:middle line:90%
Some people who call are--

00:16:56.179 --> 00:16:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not, are they?

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Are not at all.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And they say, I have longed
to see someone, anybody.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I would just love to have
an apparition or a ghost,

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:84%
any kind of visit--
have never had anything

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:90%
and they want to know why.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.839 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does this
take you in the future?

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.476 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you, Dianne?

00:17:15.476 --> 00:17:17.725 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Oh, George, that
is an excellent question.

00:17:17.725 --> 00:17:23.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have so much to
learn about the other world.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:84%
We've done so many studies here
and with people here and people

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:84%
who have had experiences
and the perceivers.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But there's been very little
research on the other side.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:84%
For instance, what
are they doing?

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:90%
How often do they visit?

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.205 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
having a party?

00:17:39.205 --> 00:17:39.705 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: There you go.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.476 align:middle line:90%
Who are they with?

00:17:43.476 --> 00:17:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Are they with a
group of friends?

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Are they-- you know, what
kind of work are they doing?

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.844 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, do they have
another life on the other side?

00:17:49.844 --> 00:17:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That's it.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It lasts
forever, right?

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Right, right.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about the devil?

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Is there a devil?

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: I have--

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.088 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've said
in our previous show

00:18:02.088 --> 00:18:03.482 align:middle line:90%
that there really is no hell.

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Well, we
don't have evidence.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.606 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that
there is no hell.

00:18:06.606 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just we don't
have evidence and "we"

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:84%
meaning all the researchers
that I've ever worked with.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're scholarly
researchers.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
We all come from
scholarly backgrounds

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:84%
or we've worked
with universities.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have any
evidence for a hell, spirits

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.180 align:middle line:90%
trapped on Earth.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what
about the devil?

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Don't have any
kind of evidence for it.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you don't
think it's there?

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I haven't-- I
don't-- I have not ever had any

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.090 align:middle line:84%
kind of evidence
that it's there.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any experience
of it being there.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
that I disbelieve but I

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
am reluctant to believe, simply
but-- you know, George, I'm

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:90%
69 years old.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I've been researching
for a long time.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you have.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend that
people try to contact

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:90%
those on the other side?

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that important to them?

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: It depends on
why they want to contact.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great
question, George.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of
people say, I would

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.910 align:middle line:84%
love to contact my mother, my
dad, my uncle, my whomever.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Spirits cannot be conjured.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.389 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can invite
them and I see nothing

00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:90%
wrong with inviting them.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Mom, I would really
like to talk with you.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:90%
But we cannot conjure a spirit.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:84%
There's places that they
evidently have to go

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and things they have to do.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would never even
invite my mother, for example,

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.340 align:middle line:84%
because George, what if she's
holding up a flying airplane

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.400 align:middle line:90%
or helping with a sinking ship?

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be selfish and
have her come see me and drop

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:90%
what she's doing.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So I would never
invite-- I might say,

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:45.137 align:middle line:84%
at some point in your leisure,
you know, I'm open for it.

00:19:45.137 --> 00:19:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Come on by.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.011 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: There you go.

00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Come on by.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:84%
There are some people out there
who are truly mentally ill.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.550 align:middle line:90%
They see things.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:90%
They hear things.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.650 align:middle line:84%
How do you distinguish
between that and a real case

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.947 align:middle line:90%
about afterlife encounters?

00:20:03.947 --> 00:20:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: That is an
excellent question, George.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.270 align:middle line:84%
The way we extinguish
between what

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.332 align:middle line:84%
we call a hallucination, someone
who's just hallucinating.

00:20:11.332 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not really there--

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that happens.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: That happens a lot,
a lot and then someone who's

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.620 align:middle line:84%
really having an
afterlife encounter

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:84%
is the hallucinations are
terrifying, absolutely

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.380 align:middle line:90%
terrifying.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:84%
The person usually
is so terrified, so

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.310 align:middle line:84%
traumatized, that they
need some type of sedation,

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:33.200 align:middle line:84%
some type of medication,
whereas afterlife encounters,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.550 align:middle line:84%
at least those that we have
researched, are comforting.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my study
that I did with 6,000

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.720 align:middle line:84%
international participants
all found comfort to-- well,

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.640 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't say "all."

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:84%
90-- I think about 96% found
comfort to some degree.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:47.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:20:47.975 --> 00:20:48.891 align:middle line:10%
That's a great number.

00:20:48.891 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: Huge.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Who's more apt
to see the other side?

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.220 align:middle line:90%
Children?

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Adults?

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.010 align:middle line:90%
How do you--

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: The more
apt to the other side,

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.010 align:middle line:84%
it depends on personality
type, basically.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I did a study with
a Myers-Briggs,

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:84%
which is extra-- excuse me--
extravert versus introvert,

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:90%
thinking versus feeling.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And from that study, I
found that feeling types

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.729 align:middle line:84%
are more likely to have
afterlife encounters.

00:21:15.729 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's because--
you know, the thinkers-- I don't

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:84%
know if you're a thinking-- no,
you're not probably a thinking

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:21.430 align:middle line:90%
type.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.189 align:middle line:84%
The thinking types
are constantly

00:21:23.189 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
putting things
through in their head,

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:90%
just constantly processing.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Their mental state is so active.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:33.700 align:middle line:84%
They never just sit back for a
minute, whereas I'm a feeling

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:90%
type, high-level feeling type.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:84%
My mind kind of closed
down for a little bit,

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:84%
can slow down a
little to where that's

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.650 align:middle line:84%
why the feeling type are able
to have afterlife encounters.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.975 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The ancients were
very big on the afterlife.

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:49.850 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: Very big.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.058 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And that seems to
have carried through to us

00:21:52.058 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:10%
at this time.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.960 align:middle line:10%
Do you think they knew
anything that we don't yet

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.657 align:middle line:10%
at this point?

00:21:57.657 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: That's another
great question, George.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they knew
anything that we don't.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I know that their lives were
centered on the afterlife.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
obsessed with it.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Oh, yes.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Their lives were based
around getting prepared

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:12.715 align:middle line:90%
for their afterlife.

00:22:12.715 --> 00:22:13.215 align:middle line:90%
Their--

00:22:13.215 --> 00:22:15.631 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They wrote books,
"The Tibetan Book of the Dead,"

00:22:15.631 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:90%
"The Egyptian Book of Dead."

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.752 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they just were
part of this all the time.

00:22:19.752 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Yes,
they did drawings.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.039 align:middle line:90%
They did--

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They dwelled
on this all the time.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Constantly.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And this was-- they
did their little boats

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.120 align:middle line:84%
or they made their carvings
and their sketches of the boats

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:90%
for the afterlife.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:90%
They would get on a boat and--

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.714 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Off they go.

00:22:32.714 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Off they go.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:90%
They were very focused on it.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like for a
while, we got away from that.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we can thank
science for bringing us back

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
to this point because when
the scientists at Fordham

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:84%
began researching and
they said, wait a minute.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
We cannot explain this
or how could this happen?

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Then, it seems like
more people became

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:84%
fascinated and engaged
with the thought of, OK, so

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:90%
consciousness is here.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.856 align:middle line:90%
So energy-- energy never dies.

00:23:01.856 --> 00:23:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.700 align:middle line:84%
You talked earlier in another
program about a phone call

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:90%
from a woman's husband.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:84%
What manifests that spirit to be
able to physically ring a phone

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:90%
or leave a message or move keys?

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:90%
How do they do this?

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: What manifests
the apparition or the spirit

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.700 align:middle line:84%
to be able to manipulate a
physical object here on Earth,

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.190 align:middle line:84%
many years ago, we
thought that it was us,

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that we project our
energy so much that we

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.510 align:middle line:84%
could, with them, combine
and move physical objects.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:84%
But now, we have
found-- like, there

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:45.440 align:middle line:84%
are several examples in my book
where the person didn't even

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:84%
know the physical
object was being moved,

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:84%
like this lady whose husband
left her the message that

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.170 align:middle line:90%
was in the former.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And what manifests, George,
is we know there's energy.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:02.080 align:middle line:84%
How they can actually move
that physical object seems

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.854 align:middle line:84%
to be strictly by their
energy is so strong.

00:24:06.854 --> 00:24:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
anything that we

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:90%
should be scared of with this?

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: To my knowledge,
there is absolutely nothing

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:90%
to be afraid of.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.466 align:middle line:10%
As they say, "Fear is our fear."

00:24:18.466 --> 00:24:19.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Promise?

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:19.846 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: Yes.

00:24:19.846 --> 00:24:23.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Pinky promise?

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: George, honestly, I
have never run across anything.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.519 align:middle line:84%
Now, people have
been frightened.

00:24:28.519 --> 00:24:31.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a story in my book about
a grandmother whose grandson

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:84%
came to see her and
she was so startled

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
that she pulled the covers up
over her head and went, ah!

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.924 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people would do that.

00:24:38.924 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Yes.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But then later, she said,
oh, why did I do that?

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:90%
He was there.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:90%
He reached his arm out for me.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:84%
He was there to
tell me something.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Why did I do that?

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, most people who
have those things happen

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:90%
say, they try.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.300 align:middle line:84%
They try so hard to
bring that person back

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:84%
because they want to
know why they were there.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:84%
They know they were
there for a reason.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Then, they're not afraid.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just they don't
understand them.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.510 align:middle line:84%
If we just get people to
understand what they are,

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:90%
they would not be afraid.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember the movie,
"A Christmas Carol," when

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.590 align:middle line:84%
those three ghosts visited
Scrooge and he would just

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.610 align:middle line:84%
come over the covers and
he'd peek and he'd be afraid?

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.724 align:middle line:84%
Why are people afraid
of the other side?

00:25:20.724 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Because
we don't understand.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle line:84%
It's been-- for one thing, it's
been so taboo with religion.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.489 align:middle line:84%
You know, oh, no,
you can't conjure.

00:25:27.489 --> 00:25:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Asking for a deceased
loved one, that's conjuring

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:90%
and we can't conjure them.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's the movies
and the television

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.975 align:middle line:84%
shows present them
as frightening.

00:25:38.975 --> 00:25:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
all frightening.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:41.122 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Fear sells.

00:25:41.122 --> 00:25:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Action and frightening.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: There you go.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And fear sells, right, George?

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.726 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, nobody's
going to go to a movie

00:25:45.726 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:90%
just to see something happy.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:90%
They want to be frightened.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.661 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That's right.

00:25:49.661 --> 00:25:52.536 align:middle line:84%
And Dean and I have-- Dean Radin
and I have talked about this.

00:25:52.536 --> 00:25:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I said, Dean, but they
want to be frightened.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And so if there's a
frightening experience,

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.760 align:middle line:90%
they're going to put that on.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.640 align:middle line:84%
But we just-- in our
research-- and Dean

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.316 align:middle line:84%
is part of it-- we have not
found anything frightening.

00:26:03.316 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I mean, what's
more exciting to listen to,

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:10%
that, ladies and gentlemen,
a tornado of a magnitude five

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:10%
has just blown through a city
and has destroyed the town

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:10%
or it's sunny out
today and it's nice?

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: That's right.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to listen to which?

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.152 align:middle line:84%
Where does your
research take you next

00:26:25.152 --> 00:26:26.610 align:middle line:84%
because I know
you're not stopping?

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you?

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I would like to find
out more about the apparitions.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, we know why they come here.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:84%
They come here for
a purpose and that

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
is to help us
during a transition,

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:90%
any kind of transition.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:84%
It can be to
celebrate a wedding.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:90%
It can be after a divorce.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.770 align:middle line:84%
It can be absolutely
any kind of transition.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:52.810 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to know more
about their side over there.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:53.310 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:90%
So they come here.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So what were they doing
before they arrived here?

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Were they having a party?

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Were they with other friends?

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Do they go back to our family of
origin and they group together?

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:90%
What do we know?

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the day that you
leave us-- it's kind of sad

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.800 align:middle line:84%
but everybody in this building
is going to face that one day.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.260 align:middle line:90%
What will you be thinking about?

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: Oh my
goodness, George, no one

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.260 align:middle line:90%
has ever asked me that before.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.359 align:middle line:90%
What will I be thinking about?

00:27:23.359 --> 00:27:24.275 align:middle line:90%
I will be questioning.

00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
just ready to go.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:26.820 align:middle line:84%
You're ready to go
to the other side.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: That's right.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.811 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are you thinking?

00:27:28.811 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I will be--
if I haven't already

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.890 align:middle line:84%
seen the person is, who
will be there to greet me?

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.750 align:middle line:84%
One thing I found
during hospice is

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.362 align:middle line:84%
those that we love the most who
loved us the most in return--

00:27:40.362 --> 00:27:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're there.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Always there.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They are-- George,
I have never sat

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.840 align:middle line:84%
with a dying person that did
not have someone they dearly

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.900 align:middle line:84%
loved who loved them in
return there to welcome them

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes,
the dying see them.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:28:00.610 align:middle line:84%
They're in bed and they
just-- there's Aunt Emma.

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:90%
There's my father.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:90%
There's my uncle.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're there
standing by the bedside.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:90%
We don't see this but they do.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.732 align:middle line:90%
Are we sure they're seeing that?

00:28:12.732 --> 00:28:13.690 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: And again--

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And not hallucinating?

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.680 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: Can we say sure?

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.410 align:middle line:10%
We have the evidence.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.760 align:middle line:10%
We have the evidence
that when someone

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.804 align:middle line:10%
is spiritually open,
whether they're dying,

00:28:23.804 --> 00:28:25.970 align:middle line:10%
whether they're terribly
ill, whether they're having

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.700 align:middle line:10%
a crisis, we spiritually open.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we're
more susceptible or more

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.730 align:middle line:84%
likely to experience
the other side.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important
is it for people

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:40.217 align:middle line:84%
to believe in the other
side, in this existence?

00:28:40.217 --> 00:28:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ARCANGEL: I believe it's
terribly important for people

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.660 align:middle line:84%
to believe that there
is another existence,

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.290 align:middle line:90%
that there is life after death.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And probably before,
my husband was

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.620 align:middle line:90%
an absolute total non-believer.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And no one supported
my work more

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:84%
than he did because
he said, I sit back

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and I see the difference in
the people that you talk with

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and those who believe and
those who are like me, atheists

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and we don't
believe in anything.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And he had a horrible
death, George.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:90%
He had a terrible death.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I would not wish
his death on anyone

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:90%
because he did not believe.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So it makes a
tremendous difference,

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.675 align:middle line:84%
not only in life
but really at death,

00:29:14.675 --> 00:29:15.800 align:middle line:90%
it makes such a difference.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that transition
is going to be fascinating

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.814 align:middle line:90%
when that time comes.

00:29:18.814 --> 00:29:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ARCANGEL: Yes.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I wonder how it'll be.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:23.075 align:middle line:10%
I guess we'll wait.

00:29:23.075 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: Peace,
love, and joy.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Dianne, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.169 align:middle line:10%
>>ARCANGEL: Thank you, George.

00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:28.150 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Look, we're under no
rush to get to the other side.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:10%
But if and when
that time happens,

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.520 align:middle line:10%
maybe you'll be prepared
with programs like this.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.240 align:middle line:90%
