>> [Background Music]

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.015 align:middle line:84%
And I think many people
today don't know what

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.049 align:middle line:90%
to believe anymore.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.251 align:middle line:90%
>> People basically need to keep

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.554 align:middle line:84%
on to help uncover
what really happened.

>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:24.858 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.794 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told the
entire story.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.368 align:middle line:84%
>> And now the host of
the nationally syndicated,

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:38.272 align:middle line:84%
Coast to Coast A.M. and Gaiam
TV bring you Beyond Belief

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:39.139 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:40.807 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Thank you.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.377 align:middle line:84%
I should have more applause
like that more often.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.578 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, governments will
do just about anything

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.216 align:middle line:84%
to have an advantage
over other nations,

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:52.519 align:middle line:84%
and that includes something
called "remote viewing".

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.322 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest on
Beyond Belief is an expert

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:59.092 align:middle line:84%
in remote viewing because he was
part of the government's program

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.162 align:middle line:84%
and he also heads up the
Matrix Intelligence Agency

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:06.033 align:middle line:84%
which is a private consultancy
company that also looks

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:09.102 align:middle line:84%
into remote viewing,
Major Ed Dames.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.138 align:middle line:90%
[ Applause ]

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:12.773 align:middle line:90%
Hello Major.

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:13.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Ed Dames: Good, good.

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:14.274 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: How are you?

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Ed Dames: I'm OK.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:16.343 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Good to see you.

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:20.146 align:middle line:84%
Ed, how did you get
involved in remote viewing?

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.914 align:middle line:84%
>> Ed Dames: Well I was
operating at the Office

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:25.018 align:middle line:84%
of Secretary Defense
level, very black units,

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:28.188 align:middle line:84%
very black operations,
and one of the tools

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.424 align:middle line:84%
that I used was the
remote viewing unit.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
In those days, they
were psychics.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.294 align:middle line:90%
We did not have remote viewing.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:37.396 align:middle line:84%
It's purely psychics, but they
were very gifted psychics.

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:41.501 align:middle line:84%
And there was mail that
we just could not answer.

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.538 align:middle line:84%
There were problems
of national security,

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:49.076 align:middle line:84%
mostly erstwhile Soviet Union
rocket missile development.

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:50.978 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't penetrate
those programs.

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:52.646 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't penetrate by hook

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:55.582 align:middle line:84%
or by crook biological
warfare programs,

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.652 align:middle line:90%
the very close-hold programs.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:02.222 align:middle line:84%
So, as an act of
desperation, the military, CIA,

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:05.158 align:middle line:84%
to a certain extent,
used psychics.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.627 align:middle line:84%
But then at Stanford
Research Institute,

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:12.065 align:middle line:84%
now SRI International, a syntax
and grammar was discovered

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:15.302 align:middle line:84%
for how unconscious communicates
to conscious awareness.

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:16.903 align:middle line:84%
In essence, this
was the beginning

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.805 align:middle line:90%
of the Nascent Remote Program.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.074 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Were the Soviets
doing that at this time too?

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.209 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: The Russians--

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.014 align:middle line:84%
The Russian KGB never
learned to train this.

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:30.951 align:middle line:84%
And they used very, very gifted
psychics in their programs.

00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:34.588 align:middle line:84%
And the military
intelligence, the GRU,

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:37.424 align:middle line:84%
the Russian military
intelligence, they attempted

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:40.192 align:middle line:84%
to induce altered states
together, intelligence,

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:45.065 align:middle line:84%
using psychotropics, Halcion,
LSD, and that program failed

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:47.466 align:middle line:84%
for technical reasons that we
can get into later [inaudible].

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:50.337 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Our government
program, how long did it last?

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:54.174 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It began as
an experimental unit,

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.209 align:middle line:84%
not a line of black
tar, even--

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.678 align:middle line:90%
in the late '70s, about 1978.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.981 align:middle line:90%
'79, we began to experiment

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:04.284 align:middle line:84%
with using altered
states with psychics.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:07.621 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: It's amazing because
nobody would understand

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:09.389 align:middle line:84%
that during that
era, especially.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.092 align:middle line:84%
I think people are a
little aware today,

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:17.764 align:middle line:84%
but that governments would
use people like you to try

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:20.966 align:middle line:84%
to pierce the veil
and get information,

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:24.438 align:middle line:84%
critical information tapping
into the consciousness,

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:84%
tapping into whatever
is out there.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
It blows the mind just
to think about that.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.779 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Well, I think in
the future and probably

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.348 align:middle line:84%
on other planets somewhere out
there, it's probably normal.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.984 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this
capability should taught

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.319 align:middle line:84%
at elementary school
to tell you the truth.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.253 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I think you're right.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.488 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:44.458 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere along line,
we've lost that connection.

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:45.591 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: We're never-- yeah.

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:48.428 align:middle line:84%
I have to totally agree
with you on that note.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:52.031 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Tell us about remote
viewing, exactly what is that.

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:53.733 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It's essentially
a systematic

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.001 align:middle line:90%
extrasensory perception.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:58.338 align:middle line:84%
We take the innate ability
that we're all born with,

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:01.475 align:middle line:84%
that intuitive feeling that
we sometimes have knowing

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:03.376 align:middle line:84%
that the phone's going
to ring or not to get

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:04.578 align:middle line:90%
on that plane tomorrow.

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:07.013 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that feeling, we
turn that into a skill.

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:08.748 align:middle line:84%
So it's very similar
to a language.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:09.916 align:middle line:90%
We all have the capability

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.818 align:middle line:84%
to speak the language
at an early age.

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:15.188 align:middle line:84%
But unless we're exposed to a
structure, Chinese, Japanese,

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.957 align:middle line:84%
English or whatever, we can't
communicate effectively.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.024 align:middle line:90%
We need a structure.

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:20.827 align:middle line:84%
And what was discovered
in the laboratory

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:23.263 align:middle line:84%
by studying the cognitive
behavior of some

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.932 align:middle line:84%
of the best natural
psychics was the structure

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.235 align:middle line:84%
for how they process
information.

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is take this
and turn it into a skill,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.744 align:middle line:84%
very systematic way, and it
becomes a three-part process.

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.946 align:middle line:84%
Learning how to set
up the search term

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.982 align:middle line:84%
like an internet
database search.

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:43.216 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:44.518 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: You have to know
what question to ask and how

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:46.486 align:middle line:90%
to phrase it and formalize it.

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.989 align:middle line:84%
So we teach students
how to do that.

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:51.625 align:middle line:84%
The second part of the
process is the skill itself.

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:55.695 align:middle line:84%
It takes about 45 minutes to
two hours to sit down with a pen

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:59.299 align:middle line:84%
in hand, bond paper, and
go through the motions.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.168 align:middle line:90%
This is like playing in a piano.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.602 align:middle line:90%
There's no thinking involved.

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:03.703 align:middle line:90%
No thinking allowed.

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.138 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: It's like the
Ben Kingsley movie

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:90%
which you are a part of.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.041 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Yes.

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.278 align:middle line:84%
Tom Cruise asked me
to do that, train him.

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:14.481 align:middle line:84%
And the third part of the
process is the analysis,

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.582 align:middle line:84%
analyzing, because
unconscious is a language

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:19.352 align:middle line:84%
on its own, analyzing
the output.

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:23.757 align:middle line:84%
So, our output is word, ideas,
everything in the universe exist

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:25.358 align:middle line:90%
as a pattern of information.

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.827 align:middle line:84%
So we're extracting
that pattern.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.062 align:middle line:90%
There are no words.

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:31.097 align:middle line:84%
It's just a pattern, but
we grab a pattern and then,

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:35.635 align:middle line:84%
in our memory, we find out, "OK,
what is this pattern close to?"

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:38.538 align:middle line:84%
If I've never seen the color
red before and I'm attempting

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:41.508 align:middle line:84%
to remote view a performance
with the Bolshoi Ballet

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:42.676 align:middle line:90%
and there's a red curtain,

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:46.446 align:middle line:84%
I can perceive the idea
of red, the pattern.

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:47.547 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:48.648 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: But I have no
word to hang, no label.

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:49.849 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.519 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: So we can run into
software memory problems

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.121 align:middle line:84%
like that if our
thesaurus or fictionary

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.757 align:middle line:90%
of memories terms is weak.

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.558 align:middle line:90%
But the third part is analysis.

00:05:59.558 --> 00:06:02.295 align:middle line:84%
And the first part
and the second part,

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.097 align:middle line:84%
setting up the problem and the
analysis are the difficult ones.

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:07.834 align:middle line:84%
The skill itself can taught
to anyone within weeks.

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:09.135 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You know, for years,

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:12.305 align:middle line:84%
I used to think how
can we remote view

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:13.907 align:middle line:84%
when you're physically
not there?

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:16.643 align:middle line:84%
How can-- you know,
I see with my eyes,

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:19.746 align:middle line:84%
how can you basically
see with your mind?

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And then after interviewing you
so many times on Coast to Coast,

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
it started to make sense
to me that it's much more

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.689 align:middle line:90%
than physical eyesight.

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:32.659 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It's an attention
management skill.

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.195 align:middle line:84%
We turn our conscious
attention to a task,

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:37.464 align:middle line:84%
unconscious attention
immediately follows

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:38.798 align:middle line:90%
and obediently follows.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:43.169 align:middle line:84%
What we teach students to
do is hold on to the target,

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:44.371 align:middle line:90%
a psychic can't do this.

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they cannot
only not do this,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.043 align:middle line:84%
but after about 15
minutes, they do not realize

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:51.444 align:middle line:90%
when imagination begins

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:55.248 align:middle line:84%
to overlay the accurate
target-related data.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:59.452 align:middle line:84%
And we're not striving
for visuals.

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:01.588 align:middle line:84%
It should be called
remote perception

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.757 align:middle line:84%
but I kept the term
remote viewing on--

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.025 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Good point.

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:05.692 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: -- the father of
remote viewing, English one--

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:06.526 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: English one.

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:07.794 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: -- who invested this too.

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:11.298 align:middle line:84%
So when we come into a target,
if I turn my attention--

00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:14.934 align:middle line:84%
let's say I'm in New York
City right now and you're here

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:90%
and I want to find you, right?

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.905 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Where I am,
what I'm doing.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:23.109 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: George Noory slash
present location, all right?

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.013 align:middle line:84%
Well, I turn my attention
toward that.

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:29.382 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't even have to--
somebody can just give me a set

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:31.818 align:middle line:84%
of numbers 'cause my unconscious
is doing all the work.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:32.952 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:35.221 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Then I come into
this set and I grab--

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:38.291 align:middle line:84%
I grab anything I can to get an
anchor hold here before I turn

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.426 align:middle line:90%
my attention to you.

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:42.262 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to grab a
slick and a glass here

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:90%
and curved idea there.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.831 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:45.532 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: My eyes are not
closed when I work,

00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:46.666 align:middle line:90%
but I'm closing it now.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:49.536 align:middle line:84%
And I'm never attempting
to look at the target

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:52.439 align:middle line:84%
because once I do that, that
field of vision collapses.

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.276 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: So we put together-- if
these were a new weapon system,

00:07:56.276 --> 00:08:00.146 align:middle line:84%
let's say, this thing, then
I grab all of the components,

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.682 align:middle line:84%
all of the descriptions,
there's operating parts,

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:03.983 align:middle line:90%
I described those as well.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.352 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So you're pretty
accurate with that, right?

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:06.753 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: We are extremely
accurate.

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:08.121 align:middle line:90%
In fact, we have to be in life--

00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:09.622 align:middle line:84%
be used on life or
death situations,

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:11.791 align:middle line:90%
or deadly forces used.

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:16.029 align:middle line:84%
So we would describe this
weapon in all of its weight,

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:18.765 align:middle line:84%
shape and form, but we
don't have to name it.

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:20.867 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it may not even have
a name, maybe a prototype.

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.268 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:25.572 align:middle line:84%
Well in the case of looking for
me, you may visualize seeing me

00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:28.108 align:middle line:84%
in a studio somewhere
doing this.

00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you know where I am or do
you have to have like a sign

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.546 align:middle line:84%
that says Denver
and you see that?

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:34.748 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: My students

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:36.515 align:middle line:84%
and my professionals will
not know where you are.

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:39.018 align:middle line:84%
They'll be able to
accurately describe this set

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:84%
but they won't know
where you are.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.989 align:middle line:84%
I can know because I
have a specialized skill

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:84%
that we did not have
30 years ago.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.126 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:47.293 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: It's called geophysics.

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:49.829 align:middle line:84%
But-- So when I work
right now, I'm chasing one

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:52.732 align:middle line:84%
of FBI's most wanted,
two missing kids,

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.868 align:middle line:84%
my team members describe
the setting--

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:55.869 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I see.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:56.936 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: -- [inaudible]
dead or alive.

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:57.971 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And you look
for the coordinates.

00:08:57.971 --> 00:08:59.305 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: And I go after
the coordinates.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.541 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: And then we
match those up.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.676 align:middle line:84%
I can look down at overhead
photography and say, "OK,

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:06.413 align:middle line:84%
here's where I've got
this person living.

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:08.148 align:middle line:90%
Does the description match?"

00:09:08.148 --> 00:09:10.049 align:middle line:84%
If it does, we send
in the US Marshalls.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:13.353 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Does the team see
what might have happened

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:90%
to those two?

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.889 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Absolutely.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.491 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And they will tell
them no matter what--

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:19.592 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Absolutely.

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:20.693 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- what they
think they see, right?

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:21.995 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: That's why we
don't work with parents.

00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:23.329 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You can't.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:26.065 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It's-- We did that a
long time ago and it's not--

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.867 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What's the accuracy
rate on something like this?

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.369 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: A hundred percent.

00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:33.072 align:middle line:84%
But it takes-- it can take
upward to two weeks to do that.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.708 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And do you have a number
of people working on a project

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and you take the best eight out
of ten, or something like that?

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.182 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: No, because we don't
know what the best eight

00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:43.583 align:middle line:90%
out of ten would be.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:84%
At any given time, I will not
use more than six professionals

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.788 align:middle line:84%
because it's information
overload,

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:50.657 align:middle line:90%
we don't need that many people.

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:52.859 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Yet, the other two
could be the accurate ones,

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:54.060 align:middle line:90%
I guess, right?

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.563 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It's sort of like
minority report that we--

00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.631 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Actually no.

00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:01.568 align:middle line:84%
For beginning students, that's
true but not for professionals.

00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:04.437 align:middle line:84%
If they get-- If a pro makes
a mistake, they'refired.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.539 align:middle line:84%
It's just like any
other profession.

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:10.543 align:middle line:84%
If an airline pilot lands its
airliner 10-feet off the runway,

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:13.279 align:middle line:84%
well I only missed the runway
by 10-feet, you're gone,

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.048 align:middle line:90%
the same thing with my work.

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:18.184 align:middle line:84%
Once I train you to be right
100 percent all the time,

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:19.452 align:middle line:90%
don't be wrong.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.654 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Most of you will know
the name Steven Fossett.

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
He was a millionaire
who was the first

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.759 align:middle line:84%
to take a balloon
around the world.

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:33.399 align:middle line:84%
He was a very ambitious
experimenter and one day he was

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:38.872 align:middle line:84%
in a small-- very small plane
flying and he crashed it,

00:10:38.872 --> 00:10:42.275 align:middle line:84%
and nobody, nobody
knew where he was.

00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:44.711 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for a week or two.

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:45.712 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Two weeks.

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Ed was on
Coast to Coast with me

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.286 align:middle line:84%
and he said they will find the
wreckage and possibly the body

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:58.424 align:middle line:84%
in Sierra, Nevada,
in the mountains.

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:02.328 align:middle line:84%
And people would say, "Come
on, that's ridiculous."

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.197 align:middle line:90%
That's where they found him.

00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:05.899 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: I went round and
round with the search--

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:09.102 align:middle line:84%
in fact, that was the most
expensive search in US history.

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was involved
in getting on that.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.338 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It was huge.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:15.942 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It was huge and
the search team manager,

00:11:15.942 --> 00:11:18.411 align:middle line:84%
and I went round and
round, and he said, "Ed,

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:20.246 align:middle line:90%
you can't be in Sierra, Nevada.

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:22.181 align:middle line:84%
You know, the plane didn't
have enough fuel," but I said,

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:23.116 align:middle line:90%
"That's where he's at."

00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this
is how he died.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.353 align:middle line:84%
Sixty-five horsepower engine
got caught in a downdraft

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:28.688 align:middle line:90%
and could not get back.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.156 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: He could get back, it
just drove him right there.

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:31.291 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: No way.

00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, drove him right
into the rocks doing.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.364 align:middle line:90%
So, he-- the chief-- the head

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.167 align:middle line:84%
of the search team ate a
little bit of crow on that one.

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:45.705 align:middle line:84%
But now, our techniques
are precision techniques,

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:46.773 align:middle line:90%
location techniques.

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:48.074 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How do you
refine the techniques?

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:51.411 align:middle line:84%
Like you're better now than
you people were before.

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:55.748 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: No, not in terms of the
descriptive nature of the beast

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:57.884 align:middle line:84%
but in terms of accuracy
and precision, plotting

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.852 align:middle line:90%
and location far better.

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:04.223 align:middle line:84%
What that took was to
formulate a search term,

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:05.425 align:middle line:90%
what we call a "cue".

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:08.628 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I'm looking for
the Ark of the Covenant

00:12:08.628 --> 00:12:10.763 align:middle line:90%
or I'm looking for--

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
well, here's a real world
case, Stacy Peterson.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.234 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.302 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Stacy Peterson, you
might remember, Drew Peterson,

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:90%
former police officer.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.338 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:20.773 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: This was his third
wife which he offed.

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:22.742 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for
her body right now.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.911 align:middle line:84%
In order to pinpoint
that location--

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.746 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing this in fact tonight.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:31.484 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, I had to go
through a few years of feedback.

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:32.885 align:middle line:84%
I had to look for
a known thing--

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:34.354 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And see if it was there.

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:35.388 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: -- that was missing,

00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:37.156 align:middle line:84%
then I had to get in
my jeep and drive.

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.257 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:40.093 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: And I took about
10,000 miles driving

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:43.062 align:middle line:84%
to get the feedback
for certain things

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:46.799 align:middle line:84%
to formulate the
correct search terms

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.334 align:middle line:90%
because that was the problem.

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And then to develop
new strategies

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.438 align:middle line:90%
that we did not have before.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:53.773 align:middle line:90%
We got that now.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.108 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And you [inaudible]
yourself up that way basically.

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:55.942 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: That's right.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:56.943 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Let's take some question

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.278 align:middle line:84%
for Major Ed Dames
on remote viewing.

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:00.113 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.681 align:middle line:90%
This is a fascinating subject.

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:03.216 align:middle line:90%
Yes ma'am.

00:13:03.216 --> 00:13:05.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Rebecca Pittman.

00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:06.886 align:middle line:84%
On what you were
just talking about,

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:10.089 align:middle line:84%
how far in the past can
you go to find someone?

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:13.393 align:middle line:84%
For instance, like
Amelia Earhart.

00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:15.628 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
has to be fairly recent

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:90%
for you to cue in on it?

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.464 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: That's a good question.

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.466 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let me say
that mind, think of mind

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.835 align:middle line:84%
as the fifth dimension
and time the fourth.

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:24.737 align:middle line:90%
Mind is outside of time.

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:29.442 align:middle line:84%
So, there is no limitation
in terms

00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:31.144 align:middle line:90%
of future and past targets.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:35.081 align:middle line:84%
Right now, my flagship
operation is the L'Oiseau Blanc,

00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:36.215 align:middle line:90%
the White Bird.

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:38.751 align:middle line:84%
This is a plane-- This
is a crew that attempted

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:42.922 align:middle line:84%
to beat Charles Lindbergh cross
the Atlantic and they did it.

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:45.124 align:middle line:84%
But history thinks they
went down in a drink.

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:46.526 align:middle line:90%
They're lost.

00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:49.162 align:middle line:84%
You know, we found the wreckage
and we're going to go in there.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:54.634 align:middle line:84%
And this is not only-- this
was 19-- I think it was 1924,

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:56.402 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not mistaken,
something like that.

00:13:56.402 --> 00:14:00.073 align:middle line:84%
And-- So to give you an idea
of how far back when you go

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:02.975 align:middle line:84%
and we do know where
Amelia Earhart's Electra is.

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:06.012 align:middle line:84%
The engine of her Electra is
sitting in a reef somewhere,

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.047 align:middle line:84%
which I'm not going to talk
about now 'cause we want

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:84%
to set the stage with the
White Bird, the L'Oiseau Blanc,

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.519 align:middle line:84%
they made it, they beat
Charles Lindbergh by a week.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.455 align:middle line:84%
So not only will
this solve a mystery,

00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:17.957 align:middle line:84%
but it changes a page
in history as well.

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:20.626 align:middle line:84%
So, this is our flagship
operation.

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:21.327 align:middle line:90%
It's a good one.

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:22.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, I love it.

00:14:22.662 --> 00:14:23.963 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I remember
you were talking

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:26.699 align:middle line:84%
about the very tragic case,
that of Natalee Holloway,

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:30.036 align:middle line:84%
the women who disappeared
in Aruba.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:34.173 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you pinpointed
her that she was in the ocean

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:36.209 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of a
lobster cage or something.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.511 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: We feel that we--

00:14:38.511 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:84%
our work indicated
that she was crunched

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.517 align:middle line:84%
up in a lobster cage
and-- in the ocean.

00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:47.019 align:middle line:90%
I sent-- I have an agent that--

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:49.455 align:middle line:84%
a field agent, he speaks
in a number of languages

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:50.957 align:middle line:90%
and he's my man on the ground.

00:14:50.957 --> 00:14:52.258 align:middle line:90%
I sent him to Aruba.

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:55.628 align:middle line:84%
He had an underwater sled
and we had GPS go on this,

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:57.463 align:middle line:90%
but you have to pop up--

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:58.664 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:14:58.664 --> 00:14:59.832 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: -- the GPS to about
a foot of the surface

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.567 align:middle line:84%
to get a reading,
pull it back down.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:84%
We did not want to work
with the local police

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.705 align:middle line:84%
because we felt they
were corrupt.

00:15:05.705 --> 00:15:09.542 align:middle line:84%
And my man would be in
trouble and possibly in danger.

00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:11.811 align:middle line:84%
So he was on the water
the whole time looking

00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:14.847 align:middle line:84%
for that lobster cage, but we
weren't able to get close enough

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:17.316 align:middle line:84%
to it because he started
to become surveilled.

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:19.919 align:middle line:84%
They were looking at this
guy entering the water

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.854 align:middle line:90%
from over here by this refinery

00:15:21.854 --> 00:15:23.856 align:middle line:84%
and wondering what
is this guy doing.

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:26.259 align:middle line:84%
So he attracted too much
attention we had to pull out.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:28.327 align:middle line:84%
Later on, using just
pure remote viewing,

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:90%
we found out that what was left

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.032 align:middle line:84%
to her was mostly distributed
throughout the ocean.

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:34.433 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah, I could see that.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.169 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to our Beyond
Belief cam

00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:38.638 align:middle line:84%
and get a question
Major Ed Dames.

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:41.641 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi Ed, this is Kelly
from Hawaii

00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:42.975 align:middle line:90%
and I was wondering

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:46.546 align:middle line:84%
if our enemies could ever use
remote viewing against us.

00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Could they?

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.248 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: In my world-- in
this world or anybody

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:51.651 align:middle line:84%
who learns remote viewing,
it's a world without secrets.

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:52.919 align:middle line:90%
There are no secrets.

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.954 align:middle line:84%
Anything you turn your
attention to, it can be known.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.723 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you can stop me
for knowing anything about you,

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.458 align:middle line:90%
nor I to be able to stop you.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Because if it were telepathic,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.097 align:middle line:84%
if there were an energetic
connection between you and I,

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:06.299 align:middle line:90%
that would be different.

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:07.867 align:middle line:90%
There are things that we can do.

00:16:07.867 --> 00:16:11.871 align:middle line:84%
But when I remote view you, I
am not going to do-- I'm going--

00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:13.573 align:middle line:84%
"going", I use the
term loosely--

00:16:13.573 --> 00:16:16.275 align:middle line:84%
I'm turning my attention,
my unconscious attention

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:20.046 align:middle line:84%
to the way you exist as
a pattern of information

00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:22.915 align:middle line:84%
in another dimension
in the universe.

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:24.650 align:middle line:84%
You can't stop me
from doing that.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.486 align:middle line:84%
I'm reading the book about
George Noory, so to speak.

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:28.187 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:29.789 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: So, you're here.

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:31.958 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I slip my
students a mickey.

00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.125 align:middle line:90%
I give them a blind target,

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:34.493 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know
what the target is

00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:36.863 align:middle line:84%
because you're training their
unconscious to do the work.

00:16:36.863 --> 00:16:40.199 align:middle line:84%
I'll have them remote view
themselves at the present time.

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:90%
So now they're looking

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.936 align:middle line:84%
at themselves the way they
exist in another dimension.

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:46.739 align:middle line:84%
So they are emotional-- their
emotions will be the same

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:49.141 align:middle line:84%
as the person they think
they're remote viewing.

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:51.677 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Is remote
viewing strictly viewing

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:55.948 align:middle line:84%
or can you literally
alter events by doing it?

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It's a-- generally
speaking,

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.752 align:middle line:84%
Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle,

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:02.989 align:middle line:84%
not what's standing,
generally is a passive thing.

00:17:02.989 --> 00:17:07.926 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to get into
other technical areas right now

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:09.795 align:middle line:90%
about mind over matter,

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:12.397 align:middle line:84%
our sister science
telekinesis, psychokinesis.

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:14.267 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we have a lot of
experience in that we--

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:18.938 align:middle line:84%
in fact, we've used remote
viewing to model those things,

00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:22.675 align:middle line:84%
to take an instance where any
reasonable person would say,

00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:25.912 align:middle line:84%
"This is an act of a
Uri Geller effect,"

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:29.015 align:middle line:84%
psychokinetic activity
actually happen here.

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:33.152 align:middle line:84%
And we use remote viewing to
look at that event and model it.

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:35.521 align:middle line:84%
And after we're through, we
have a piece of paper called

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:39.358 align:middle line:84%
"site template" with all the
knowns connected with the event.

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:40.393 align:middle line:90%
We look for the unknown.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Hey, what's this?

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.328 align:middle line:90%
What's this?

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
dynamics and the mechanics--

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.665 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:47.133 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: -- that allowed
this interaction to happen.

00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:49.268 align:middle line:84%
Now we studied that
and we model it.

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:52.138 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, viewing can
be used as in to many,

00:17:52.138 --> 00:17:54.106 align:middle line:90%
many different phenomena.

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:56.008 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's take another
question from Major Ed Dames.

00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:56.943 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir, right here.

00:17:56.943 --> 00:17:58.778 align:middle line:90%
Stand up please.

00:17:58.778 --> 00:18:01.013 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Eric Bottin.

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:06.218 align:middle line:84%
I have heard that anyone can
be taught to remote view,

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:09.956 align:middle line:84%
but what makes some
better than others

00:18:09.956 --> 00:18:11.691 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to remote viewing.

00:18:11.691 --> 00:18:15.227 align:middle line:84%
Is it innate ability or is
it the level of training?

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And if it's innate ability,
can that be compensated for

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:90%
but with more training?

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.538 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Generally speaking,

00:18:25.538 --> 00:18:27.406 align:middle line:84%
what makes a good remote viewer
is what makes a person good

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:30.309 align:middle line:84%
at any other skill, work,
like dent of hard life.

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:33.846 align:middle line:84%
My natural ability, my
natural innate ability,

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:36.816 align:middle line:84%
psychic ability was
below average.

00:18:36.816 --> 00:18:39.118 align:middle line:84%
I had to make up for
that by dent of labor,

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.921 align:middle line:90%
a lot of years of hard work, OK?

00:18:41.921 --> 00:18:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And our work, I know as
a teacher and I can spot

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
within a number of hours
the level of innate ability,

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.930 align:middle line:90%
one's innate psychic antenna,

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.032 align:middle line:84%
I can spot that within
a few hours.

00:18:53.032 --> 00:18:58.604 align:middle line:84%
If a person is highly--
has a great long antenna,

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:02.608 align:middle line:84%
if their birthright gives them a
lot of natural psychic ability,

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I can turn them not
only into professional,

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
which I can do the most
to anyone, on an all star.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.848 align:middle line:90%
The difference between I

00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:12.218 align:middle line:84%
and they are I can
solve a problem within,

00:19:12.218 --> 00:19:13.953 align:middle line:90%
let's say, 45 minutes.

00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:16.489 align:middle line:84%
This is a problem
solving tool as well

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:18.791 align:middle line:84%
as a descriptive
tool, remote viewing.

00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:22.495 align:middle line:84%
But the gifted psychic, the
very gifted student can produce

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:27.833 align:middle line:84%
about twice as much detail as
I in the same period of time.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.036 align:middle line:90%
That's the only difference.

00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:31.037 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I like that.

00:19:31.037 --> 00:19:32.104 align:middle line:84%
How about another
question for him?

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:33.406 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir, right here.

00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:35.841 align:middle line:84%
>> Does the government still
use remote viewing and was

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:39.211 align:middle line:84%
that involved in the
apprehension of Bin Laden?

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:41.213 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: No, our government--
US government does not--

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:42.648 align:middle line:90%
no longer uses remote viewing

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:44.517 align:middle line:84%
for political reasons,
particularly.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:48.754 align:middle line:84%
And we did not-- my team used it
to look for Bin Laden a couple

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:51.323 align:middle line:84%
of times and we-- I
passed that information

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:53.659 align:middle line:84%
on to US Special
Operations Command.

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:55.327 align:middle line:90%
I still have contacts there.

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:58.064 align:middle line:84%
But the US does not use remote
viewing anymore in operations.

00:19:58.064 --> 00:19:59.665 align:middle line:90%
The government of India does.

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:90%
The government of China does.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.937 align:middle line:90%
And those are the two big ones.

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:07.706 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Did you get
close to find Bin Laden?

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.141 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: We're dead on him.

00:20:09.141 --> 00:20:12.144 align:middle line:84%
But for political reasons,
at the time when he was

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:15.948 align:middle line:84%
on the Pakistan-- inside
Pakistan, we didn't have a lot

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:19.351 align:middle line:84%
of drones in production at
that time and it was also not

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:22.121 align:middle line:84%
yet politically correct to
use a drone in Pakistan.

00:20:22.121 --> 00:20:25.157 align:middle line:84%
He was there, but our government
didn't act on the information

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:28.861 align:middle line:84%
because to have done so
would've eliminated the reason

00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:30.763 align:middle line:90%
for us to be at war.

00:20:30.763 --> 00:20:34.166 align:middle line:84%
And I think you can
understand the rest.

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:35.701 align:middle line:90%
The military industrial complex,

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:40.439 align:middle line:84%
just like Eisonhower
said is, is what it is.

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:44.009 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Tell me about this Ed.

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:46.078 align:middle line:90%
The Killshot.

00:20:47.513 --> 00:20:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: The Killshot wasn't--
is a neologism, a name I coined

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:57.756 align:middle line:84%
for something we had to
put together over a long--

00:20:57.756 --> 00:21:00.793 align:middle line:84%
over a number of years
beginning a number of years ago.

00:21:00.793 --> 00:21:04.296 align:middle line:84%
About 20 years ago
both the military team

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:08.834 align:middle line:84%
and my military team and a
newly trained civilian team--

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:11.637 align:middle line:84%
I trained the civilian team
as well to replace them--

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:14.673 align:middle line:84%
began to look ahead
in the future

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:18.244 align:middle line:84%
of the world looking
at certain things.

00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Global economic collapse, we
spotted and another thing,

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.415 align:middle line:90%
Fukushima event, unfortunately.

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:25.251 align:middle line:84%
What we saw, there was
something that was very,

00:21:25.251 --> 00:21:29.121 align:middle line:84%
very big that affected the
earth catastrophic, globally.

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
kill all mankind

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.993 align:middle line:90%
but it's very serious disaster.

00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:39.198 align:middle line:84%
And it took us a while to very
precisely isolate what this was.

00:21:39.198 --> 00:21:42.434 align:middle line:84%
And what it was, was our
own sun going on a rampage,

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:46.305 align:middle line:84%
putting out a series of very,
very strong solar flares

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.374 align:middle line:90%
over a period of months.

00:21:48.374 --> 00:21:49.542 align:middle line:90%
If not, longer.

00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:51.443 align:middle line:84%
That takes out a lot
of communications,

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:53.879 align:middle line:84%
causes massive atmospheric
disturbances,

00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:55.447 align:middle line:90%
unprecedented effects.

00:21:55.447 --> 00:22:00.319 align:middle line:84%
And indirectly causes
the death of many,

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:01.120 align:middle line:90%
many millions of people.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:01.954 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh geez.

00:22:01.954 --> 00:22:03.222 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Many millions of people.

00:22:03.222 --> 00:22:04.957 align:middle line:84%
And so, I called this the
Killshot and began to talk

00:22:04.957 --> 00:22:06.525 align:middle line:90%
about it on your program

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:09.328 align:middle line:84%
and then other places
saying get ready for this.

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:11.297 align:middle line:84%
And when it-- when,
it was the question.

00:22:11.297 --> 00:22:14.033 align:middle line:84%
So we-- because minds
outside of time.

00:22:14.033 --> 00:22:16.435 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where we
are in time as viewers.

00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:17.703 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It could be any time.

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:21.173 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: If you give me a
fossil, for instance, my team

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:24.944 align:middle line:84%
and I can sketch the-- if you
just give me a piece of fossil,

00:22:24.944 --> 00:22:27.713 align:middle line:84%
we can sketch the
entire animal or plant.

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:28.681 align:middle line:90%
What it ate?

00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:29.982 align:middle line:84%
If the plant was
carnivorous at that.

00:22:29.982 --> 00:22:31.283 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:33.652 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: But we can't tell you
where that came from and--

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:34.887 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And when it lived.

00:22:34.887 --> 00:22:37.656 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It could be the
future as far as we know.

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:39.425 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: By the way, you're
all going to get a copy

00:22:39.425 --> 00:22:41.627 align:middle line:84%
of The Killshot right
after the show.

00:22:41.627 --> 00:22:45.431 align:middle line:90%
[ Applause ]

00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:48.334 align:middle line:84%
You know, scientists are saying
that the sun is acting up.

00:22:48.334 --> 00:22:51.704 align:middle line:84%
That it's-- we're going
into this maximum cycle.

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:53.872 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Well it's-- we
have a 24 at the end of--

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:57.876 align:middle line:84%
and many epiphenomenon
on a larger cycle.

00:22:57.876 --> 00:22:59.945 align:middle line:90%
But this one, the beauty

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:03.115 align:middle line:84%
of remote viewing is it can
spot those economic black swans

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:05.818 align:middle line:84%
and it can spot those
scientific discontinuities

00:23:05.818 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:90%
that are not predictable.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.054 align:middle line:90%
And that's the beauty of the--

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:12.157 align:middle line:84%
one of the beauties of this
science as a look ahead tool,

00:23:12.157 --> 00:23:14.293 align:middle line:84%
as a crystal ball
type of a thing.

00:23:14.293 --> 00:23:15.694 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:19.765 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: And unfortunately, I have
not focused on the good things.

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:22.735 align:middle line:84%
I focused on the
deadly things in order

00:23:22.735 --> 00:23:25.704 align:middle line:84%
to save a few lives
perhaps here and there.

00:23:25.704 --> 00:23:28.774 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: When you remote
view, you're sketching.

00:23:28.774 --> 00:23:30.576 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:31.944 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: We're doing two things.

00:23:31.944 --> 00:23:33.646 align:middle line:90%
We're downloading ideas.

00:23:33.646 --> 00:23:36.715 align:middle line:84%
We're grabbing ideas
associated with the target.

00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:39.351 align:middle line:84%
For instance, an
idea here would--

00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:84%
there's a group,
a group of what?

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.155 align:middle line:90%
Life forms, OK?

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:44.723 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the life forms.

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:47.926 align:middle line:84%
Men and women, they
have clothing on.

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:51.096 align:middle line:84%
If I'm an American, I don't feel
I'm in a foreign environment.

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:52.131 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:52.898 align:middle line:90%
They're watching.

00:23:52.898 --> 00:23:53.666 align:middle line:90%
What are they're watching?

00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:54.933 align:middle line:90%
Then we start sketching.

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:56.302 align:middle line:90%
They're looking ahead.

00:23:56.302 --> 00:23:58.304 align:middle line:90%
They're-- OK, is this a zoo?

00:23:58.304 --> 00:23:59.538 align:middle line:90%
Is this a performance?

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:00.906 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:03.309 align:middle line:84%
All right, it's a-- it could
be a type of a demonstration.

00:24:03.309 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:84%
We get-- as we describe this,
our mind is being pulled closer

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.848 align:middle line:84%
and closer and closer
into the target.

00:24:09.848 --> 00:24:12.518 align:middle line:84%
So we have more and more
accurate descriptions,

00:24:12.518 --> 00:24:14.753 align:middle line:84%
it would be like
reading a novel.

00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:16.955 align:middle line:84%
The more you're into it,
the more difficult it is

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:19.091 align:middle line:84%
to pull yourself away
and the more you know

00:24:19.091 --> 00:24:20.626 align:middle line:90%
about the details there.

00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:23.228 align:middle line:84%
That's a fair analogy
for the way that we work.

00:24:23.228 --> 00:24:27.733 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we download words in a
very formatted structured way.

00:24:27.733 --> 00:24:30.402 align:middle line:84%
And then we draw-- we
sketch and we draw,

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:33.772 align:middle line:84%
we can even use modeling
compound if we desire

00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:36.542 align:middle line:90%
to model whatever we want.

00:24:36.542 --> 00:24:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You train a
lot of people Ed.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.078 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: I do.

00:24:39.078 --> 00:24:40.979 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Give me--
this is your course.

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:42.114 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Yes.

00:24:42.114 --> 00:24:43.182 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Give me the cliff
notes version of this.

00:24:43.182 --> 00:24:44.016 align:middle line:90%
I mean what do you do?

00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:45.684 align:middle line:90%
How do you start with someone?

00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:48.454 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Oh, it's quite easy
and it's a lot of fun.

00:24:48.454 --> 00:24:52.558 align:middle line:84%
We give them a lecture about--
we have to have a model.

00:24:52.558 --> 00:24:56.362 align:middle line:84%
In fact scientist, the
intellectuals, until--

00:24:56.362 --> 00:24:59.264 align:middle line:90%
they don't-- I'm a technician.

00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:00.299 align:middle line:90%
I'm a test pilot.

00:25:00.299 --> 00:25:01.834 align:middle line:90%
I crash and burn the system.

00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:03.469 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
we're doing this.

00:25:03.469 --> 00:25:04.703 align:middle line:90%
We have a model.

00:25:04.703 --> 00:25:06.538 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a model
or you can't teach it.

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:10.376 align:middle line:84%
Our model is that there is
only one mind, only one.

00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:11.877 align:middle line:90%
A brain has an oscillator,

00:25:11.877 --> 00:25:14.012 align:middle line:84%
electrochemical oscillator
is immersed

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:15.881 align:middle line:90%
in this universal minefield.

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And when we turn our unconscious
attention to something,

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.987 align:middle line:84%
we're tuning it like a radio to
a station, a particular station.

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:84%
If this is the station right
here, we tune it to that.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.359 align:middle line:90%
So we give a new student kind

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:29.928 align:middle line:84%
of a basic lecture,
just a basic lecture.

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:32.297 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of other lectures
to follow and then I tell them

00:25:32.297 --> 00:25:36.235 align:middle line:84%
to sit down, put your
pen on the paper,

00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:37.936 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you a set of numbers

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:39.938 align:middle line:84%
and the numbers are
associated with a target.

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:41.373 align:middle line:90%
Let's say this room is a target,

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:43.142 align:middle line:84%
but that's all they
have is the numbers

00:25:43.142 --> 00:25:44.276 align:middle line:84%
because they're unconsciously
thinking--

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:45.511 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And you want them
to write down numbers?

00:25:45.511 --> 00:25:47.413 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: I'm going to walk
them through the first step.

00:25:47.413 --> 00:25:49.047 align:middle line:84%
Put your pen on the
paper, here we go.

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:51.784 align:middle line:84%
You know, one, two, three,
four, eight, seven, two, five.

00:25:51.784 --> 00:25:54.887 align:middle line:84%
They produce a little squiggle
which is like a zip file.

00:25:54.887 --> 00:25:57.389 align:middle line:90%
And now, that little squiggle,

00:25:57.389 --> 00:26:01.059 align:middle line:84%
the next steps they have
through-- descriptive terms,

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.861 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you what those
are in a moment, they're going

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:05.431 align:middle line:84%
to unzip the zip file
and then its components.

00:26:05.431 --> 00:26:10.002 align:middle line:84%
So, a person may have
just a small squiggle

00:26:10.002 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:90%
which is a burst transmission

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.106 align:middle line:84%
that represents this
room right now.

00:26:14.106 --> 00:26:14.606 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:15.674 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: OK.

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:17.643 align:middle line:84%
And then, as we move
through the course,

00:26:17.643 --> 00:26:21.847 align:middle line:84%
what happens is they
begin to focus on aspects.

00:26:21.847 --> 00:26:26.452 align:middle line:84%
There's an aspect here, a table
with a man, a chair with a man,

00:26:26.452 --> 00:26:31.123 align:middle line:84%
two groups of people, equipment,
lights, strange thing back here.

00:26:31.123 --> 00:26:32.691 align:middle line:90%
They separate those components

00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:36.395 align:middle line:84%
out like framework
of a jigsaw puzzle.

00:26:36.395 --> 00:26:39.131 align:middle line:84%
And then they fill the pieces
of the jigsaw puzzle in.

00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:42.734 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end of the
session, 45 minutes or one hour,

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:84%
sometimes two hours, they
put all the pieces back to--

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.106 align:middle line:84%
of the puzzle together, now
they have the big picture.

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:84%
For us to have attempted
a visual of this,

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and I used to use altered states
in my own work in the military.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.117 align:middle line:84%
Once we get a visual,
it's-- the field collapses,

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:01.553 align:middle line:84%
we can't maintain that
visual, that's why we have--

00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:04.389 align:middle line:84%
that's why I kicked out all
the altered states guys,

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:05.791 align:middle line:84%
German barnacle
and everything.

00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:08.594 align:middle line:84%
Those guys, I said, "We can't
use you anymore because this is

00:27:08.594 --> 00:27:11.797 align:middle line:84%
so accurate, it's a far
superior tool this remote

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:13.131 align:middle line:90%
viewing animal."

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.166 align:middle line:90%
But that's the way we do it.

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:15.234 align:middle line:90%
We put the pieces together.

00:27:15.234 --> 00:27:16.969 align:middle line:84%
We describe what those
people are doing.

00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:18.904 align:middle line:84%
We describe those
people, they're sitting,

00:27:18.904 --> 00:27:20.272 align:middle line:84%
they're watching,
they're thinking,

00:27:20.272 --> 00:27:22.074 align:middle line:84%
and we can focus
on any individual.

00:27:22.074 --> 00:27:23.208 align:middle line:90%
We can get right in their mind.

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:90%
We can get into the past.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.011 align:middle line:90%
Do anything we want.

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:27.613 align:middle line:90%
But right now, for a student,

00:27:27.613 --> 00:27:29.548 align:middle line:84%
it's just to describe
the setting.

00:27:29.548 --> 00:27:31.817 align:middle line:84%
What is happening
here, what's going on?

00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:33.986 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And I remember you
taught me once and you said,

00:27:33.986 --> 00:27:36.989 align:middle line:90%
"Don't think, let it happen."

00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:38.557 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: You're not allowed
to think or I hit you

00:27:38.557 --> 00:27:39.892 align:middle line:90%
with a big stick, yeah, I'll do.

00:27:39.892 --> 00:27:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: As you start
thinking, you do what?

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.329 align:middle line:84%
You start creating your
own images in your head--

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:46.598 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: You're going
to allow imagination

00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:48.967 align:middle line:84%
and your unconscious
can't do its job

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:50.936 align:middle line:84%
because you're listening
to the small signal.

00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:56.074 align:middle line:84%
I use the term "listen"
loosely, and it's--

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:90%
think about playing the piano.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.213 align:middle line:84%
You don't stop and think about
the note that you just played.

00:28:01.213 --> 00:28:02.414 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the music
stops, right?

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:03.115 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:28:03.115 --> 00:28:03.815 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: The whole piece--

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:04.616 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It just happens.

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: -- [inaudible] over.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:06.285 align:middle line:90%
You can not think about the--

00:28:06.285 --> 00:28:07.386 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's like driving a car.

00:28:07.386 --> 00:28:10.289 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: If I describe--
If I describe shiny,

00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:12.724 align:middle line:90%
bright, clicking, all right?

00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:16.194 align:middle line:84%
Gee, if I stop and think
about it and try to analyze it

00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:18.297 align:middle line:84%
on the fly, I'll
lose the target.

00:28:18.297 --> 00:28:18.797 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:19.631 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: OK.

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:20.599 align:middle line:90%
So that's-- it's an analogous

00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:22.334 align:middle line:84%
of playing the piano
only backwards.

00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:24.536 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's something else.

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:27.940 align:middle line:84%
In terms of how it works,
here's an example, you know,

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.909 align:middle line:84%
you go to Las Vegas, you
play a little black jack

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:34.613 align:middle line:84%
and you know the dealer
is going to flip a card.

00:28:34.613 --> 00:28:37.382 align:middle line:84%
Here comes an eight,
here comes an ace,

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.718 align:middle line:84%
and you're right
most of the time.

00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:43.422 align:middle line:84%
Are we remote viewing
that or are we making

00:28:43.422 --> 00:28:46.258 align:middle line:90%
that eight or ace pop up?

00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:47.893 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It's an interesting
question.

00:28:47.893 --> 00:28:52.698 align:middle line:84%
After years of talking
with my colleagues,

00:28:52.698 --> 00:28:56.702 align:middle line:84%
we think that all those
events already exist in time,

00:28:56.702 --> 00:28:58.503 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't make
anything happen.

00:28:58.503 --> 00:28:59.338 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:28:59.338 --> 00:29:00.739 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: That the event already--

00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:02.474 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So the eight was going to
happen, we just saw it coming.

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:05.344 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: I don't like that in
terms of free will, ideas and--

00:29:05.344 --> 00:29:07.479 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't make me comfortable.

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:10.682 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much evidence in
our work that supports the idea

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:12.184 align:middle line:84%
that those moments
already exist.

00:29:12.184 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:90%
In fact, you know, all--

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:84%
the moment when you
lifted up my Killshot DVD,

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.192 align:middle line:90%
where did that moment go?

00:29:20.192 --> 00:29:23.762 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's just as real as
this one which is now gone.

00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:27.199 align:middle line:84%
The earth has rotated so
far and move through space.

00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:31.003 align:middle line:84%
But all those moments are just
as real as this passing one now

00:29:31.003 --> 00:29:33.438 align:middle line:84%
and the one that will follow
in a few moments from now.

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:36.008 align:middle line:84%
A moment of time is about three
seconds for a human being,

00:29:36.008 --> 00:29:40.278 align:middle line:84%
about 3,000 milliseconds as
we integrate all of the many,

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:42.347 align:middle line:84%
many percepts which
are quite a bit,

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:47.486 align:middle line:84%
about 31,000 actually
from each second.

00:29:47.486 --> 00:29:49.287 align:middle line:90%
We integrate all that.

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:84%
We throw out the stuff
that we don't need

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.691 align:middle line:90%
and we process this up.

00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:54.893 align:middle line:84%
Right now, my attention
is answering your question

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:57.362 align:middle line:90%
as articulately as I can.

00:29:57.362 --> 00:29:59.564 align:middle line:84%
And all the other
stuff around me,

00:29:59.564 --> 00:30:01.533 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of things
excel throughout,

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:02.601 align:middle line:90%
but it's still there.

00:30:02.601 --> 00:30:03.735 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: We just-- our cup
would it run

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.905 align:middle line:84%
over if we try to
process everything,

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:08.306 align:middle line:90%
but these moments exist.

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:10.208 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Why do they
call you Doom?

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:13.011 align:middle line:90%
They do, they call him Dr. Doom.

00:30:13.011 --> 00:30:15.847 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: That was my nemdigger
in the military.

00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:19.851 align:middle line:84%
I was this country's
biological warfare case office.

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:21.653 align:middle line:84%
So when I would brief at
the White House each week,

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:23.989 align:middle line:84%
I'd go over to the old
executive office building,

00:30:23.989 --> 00:30:26.758 align:middle line:84%
here out would come an Air
Force colonel who had just told

00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:30.829 align:middle line:84%
that the National Security
Council or someone else, others,

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:35.367 align:middle line:84%
about the most recent
Russian Megatonage.

00:30:35.367 --> 00:30:36.568 align:middle line:90%
And that got pretty boring.

00:30:36.568 --> 00:30:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But when I would walk
in there, I'd say, OK.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.571 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Here's come doom.

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:40.572 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: This is what we
uncovered, you know.

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:44.276 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the
Sovs, the Soviets,

00:30:44.276 --> 00:30:47.546 align:middle line:84%
have taken Naja naja
oxiana toxin"--

00:30:47.546 --> 00:30:50.782 align:middle line:84%
the Indian Cobra,
Naja naja oxiana--

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:51.917 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:30:51.917 --> 00:30:53.251 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Has taken a
toxin, have integrated it

00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:56.688 align:middle line:84%
into human E. coli, it's
naturally found in our gut,

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:59.725 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to spray
that on a submarine crew

00:30:59.725 --> 00:31:02.461 align:middle line:84%
as it leaves port
in New England.

00:31:02.461 --> 00:31:05.197 align:middle line:84%
And then above 48 hours
later, the entire crew--

00:31:05.197 --> 00:31:06.531 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Is sick.

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:08.333 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Not only sick, it feels
like they're being bitten

00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:12.270 align:middle line:84%
by a cobra in their
stomach and they're dying.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.573 align:middle line:84%
And so, these guys would come
out from around the table

00:31:14.573 --> 00:31:16.374 align:middle line:84%
and listen to me
and that's how I--

00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:19.945 align:middle line:84%
those are the kinds of things
that got me that nemdigger.

00:31:19.945 --> 00:31:21.046 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Is remote viewing--

00:31:21.046 --> 00:31:23.882 align:middle line:84%
I mean does it ever
remote view good things?

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:25.117 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Good things.

00:31:25.117 --> 00:31:26.651 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:27.786 align:middle line:90%
Yes, of course.

00:31:27.786 --> 00:31:30.722 align:middle line:84%
Or, the best answer to
that is a medical thing,

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:32.691 align:middle line:90%
we've saved many, many lives.

00:31:32.691 --> 00:31:34.626 align:middle line:84%
I've had the honor
of teaching some

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:36.962 align:middle line:84%
of the world's finest
leading doctors,

00:31:36.962 --> 00:31:38.263 align:middle line:90%
leading orthopedic surgeon,

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:40.832 align:middle line:84%
leading ear doctor,
and those folks.

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And I ask doctors to bring to
workshops or private training,

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:48.874 align:middle line:84%
I don't do private training
anymore, but workshops

00:31:48.874 --> 00:31:53.478 align:middle line:84%
or clinics their most
intractable problems

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:55.981 align:middle line:84%
and then we usually
remote view in this--

00:31:55.981 --> 00:31:58.550 align:middle line:84%
as a practicum in a
course to solve that.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.818 align:middle line:90%
But we can also use it--

00:31:59.818 --> 00:32:02.154 align:middle line:84%
any individual that's trained
can use it for a friend,

00:32:02.154 --> 00:32:04.422 align:middle line:84%
a loved one on, and we've
save many lives that way.

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:07.626 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How many remote viewers
had see things happening,

00:32:07.626 --> 00:32:12.197 align:middle line:84%
like Fukushima and other
tragic events, 9/11?

00:32:12.197 --> 00:32:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Did you folks see any of that?

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.234 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: We have to
be looking that way.

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:18.770 align:middle line:84%
In the case of 9/11,
nobody was looking that way.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.741 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Fukushima,
I was because TV Asahi,

00:32:22.741 --> 00:32:26.444 align:middle line:90%
a TV studio from Japan, asked me

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:28.847 align:middle line:84%
about Tokyo's next
big earthquake.

00:32:28.847 --> 00:32:30.448 align:middle line:84%
So I turned and in
fact this is on--

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You turned your
attention to that.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:33.051 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: [Inaudible], I think
you can see me, you know,

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:36.855 align:middle line:84%
actually working this
on a YouTube video.

00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:40.292 align:middle line:84%
I turned my attention in the
next earthquake and I looked

00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:43.094 align:middle line:84%
to Tokyo, described Tokyo
as not being damaged,

00:32:43.094 --> 00:32:46.798 align:middle line:84%
all the buildings coming
down, a little bit of flooding

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:51.136 align:middle line:84%
in the subways, no real
fatalities, but look over here,

00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:54.306 align:middle line:84%
here's a reactor
that's going to break.

00:32:54.306 --> 00:32:57.342 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it's going to
be at least a mini Chernobyl

00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:59.778 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to kill
50 to 80,000 people

00:32:59.778 --> 00:33:02.247 align:middle line:84%
within the first couple
of years, minimally.

00:33:02.247 --> 00:33:04.149 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And it probably will.

00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:05.483 align:middle line:90%
It has.

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:07.752 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It's going to
kill many millions.

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:09.087 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I mean, already,
they're talking

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:11.923 align:middle line:84%
about spillage that's higher
than they ever even thought.

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:15.594 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: George, we're looking at
the greatest manmade disaster

00:33:15.594 --> 00:33:19.097 align:middle line:84%
in recorded history and
probably before that.

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:21.166 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And we won't even
know the real effects.

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:23.935 align:middle line:84%
If it's in the water and it's
on the fish, how do we know?

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:26.037 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: The first of-- The
first effects you're going

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:29.574 align:middle line:84%
to see are wildlife and
then the next generation

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:31.576 align:middle line:90%
of Northern Japanese babies.

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:32.711 align:middle line:90%
They're going to look

00:33:32.711 --> 00:33:34.246 align:middle line:84%
like Chernobyl babies,
many of them do.

00:33:34.246 --> 00:33:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK, tragic.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.451 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: So Northern Japan is
going to become inhabitable.

00:33:39.451 --> 00:33:41.686 align:middle line:84%
Secretly, the Japanese
government are moving--

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:44.823 align:middle line:84%
is moving Tokyo to Myanmar,
they're making negotiations.

00:33:44.823 --> 00:33:45.523 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: They know this.

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:46.725 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Yeah, they know.

00:33:46.725 --> 00:33:48.994 align:middle line:84%
Northern Japan is going
to become a no man's land

00:33:48.994 --> 00:33:50.128 align:middle line:90%
but we're going to get it too.

00:33:50.128 --> 00:33:53.865 align:middle line:84%
When I-- When we look
at Killshot sanctuaries,

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:57.569 align:middle line:84%
places where people you
go to avoid the effects

00:33:57.569 --> 00:34:00.705 align:middle line:84%
of the Killshot and
Fukushima, we didn't know

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:02.641 align:middle line:90%
about Fukushima's effects.

00:34:02.641 --> 00:34:06.678 align:middle line:84%
But I was wondering, how come
British Columbia does not have

00:34:06.678 --> 00:34:08.079 align:middle line:90%
any survival zones?

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:09.447 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:34:09.447 --> 00:34:10.715 align:middle line:90%
It's got everything people need.

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:90%
It's got fresh water, fish.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.585 align:middle line:90%
Even if the skies are dark--

00:34:14.585 --> 00:34:15.687 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:34:15.687 --> 00:34:16.588 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: -- fish can still
survive off of algae

00:34:16.588 --> 00:34:17.422 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of years.

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.356 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:19.456 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: You have something
to eat.

00:34:19.456 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:84%
It's got all this great
compartmentalization

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:24.161 align:middle line:84%
that the bad guys can't get
you, get to where you are.

00:34:24.161 --> 00:34:27.364 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't DC a sanctuary zone?

00:34:27.364 --> 00:34:28.667 align:middle line:90%
Now we know.

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:32.737 align:middle line:84%
I have a very close hold, a
classified project to look

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:37.175 align:middle line:84%
at nuclear terrorism
or why I monitor this.

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:41.913 align:middle line:84%
My most recent check on that,
it was eclipsed by Fukushima.

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:45.050 align:middle line:84%
The Fukushima event is
more significant now

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.885 align:middle line:84%
than any nuclear
terrorist event.

00:34:46.885 --> 00:34:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's unreported.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.788 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: If that keeps on giving.

00:34:49.788 --> 00:34:51.456 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We'll talk about
it on Coast to Coast,

00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:55.260 align:middle line:84%
but I don't see a lot of people
hammering away at this story.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.527 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Because there's nothing

00:34:56.527 --> 00:34:58.363 align:middle line:84%
that any government
can do about it.

00:34:58.363 --> 00:34:59.931 align:middle line:84%
It's just like UFOs,
nothing they can do about it.

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.700 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing they
can do about it.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.401 align:middle line:90%
So they don't want to get--

00:35:03.401 --> 00:35:05.003 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to come
out to the public and say--

00:35:05.003 --> 00:35:05.837 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Mass panic.

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.973 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Well, no, that's not it.

00:35:07.973 --> 00:35:10.675 align:middle line:84%
If you're a government,
you have to be in control.

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:11.443 align:middle line:90%
You can't say--

00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: We can't help you.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:13.511 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: we don't know
and we can't--

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:14.813 align:middle line:90%
yeah, we can't handle this.

00:35:14.813 --> 00:35:17.148 align:middle line:90%
Fukushima is similar.

00:35:18.817 --> 00:35:20.018 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's sad.

00:35:20.018 --> 00:35:23.054 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It's tragedy beyond
belief, no pun intended.

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond comprehension
as far as I'm concerned.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.563 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm so gloomy
and doomy all the time,

00:35:31.563 --> 00:35:33.832 align:middle line:84%
things like that, 'cause
I get to see this stuff

00:35:33.832 --> 00:35:35.367 align:middle line:90%
and it can wear on you.

00:35:35.367 --> 00:35:36.735 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Is there a
way out for us?

00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:37.736 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: No.

00:35:37.736 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:90%
No, there's not.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:44.709 align:middle line:90%
There is but it's-- it's dicey.

00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:48.813 align:middle line:84%
There was a secret test that the
Israeli government conducted off

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:53.084 align:middle line:84%
the coast of South Africa
a long ago, an atomic test.

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:57.088 align:middle line:84%
And-- But they conducted
another test inland

00:35:57.088 --> 00:36:00.191 align:middle line:84%
and the safety feature
devices, the safety--

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:02.360 align:middle line:84%
safeties weren't there
because it would have created a

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.563 align:middle line:84%
signature that the United
States would've seen

00:36:05.563 --> 00:36:07.665 align:middle line:90%
overhead photography.

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:10.301 align:middle line:84%
But something happened,
it was very interesting.

00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:13.238 align:middle line:84%
A thing parked that was parked
on the backside of the moon

00:36:13.238 --> 00:36:17.042 align:middle line:84%
that look like a tent
structure, flexible tent.

00:36:17.042 --> 00:36:19.444 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
else to explain it.

00:36:19.444 --> 00:36:23.014 align:middle line:84%
Disappeared, popped up
above that test site,

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:25.817 align:middle line:84%
sucked up the radiation
that was above ground,

00:36:25.817 --> 00:36:26.918 align:middle line:90%
turned it into something

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:29.054 align:middle line:84%
like electricity back
to the moon it went.

00:36:29.054 --> 00:36:31.389 align:middle line:84%
So I'm hoping that
these guys, you know--

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:32.657 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Come and save us.

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:33.792 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: That's my hope.

00:36:33.792 --> 00:36:34.926 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Well, you know what?

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:38.630 align:middle line:84%
The late remote viewer
Ingo Swann saw something

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.832 align:middle line:90%
on the far side of the moon.

00:36:40.832 --> 00:36:44.436 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people thought, "Well,
maybe he wrote about that

00:36:44.436 --> 00:36:48.973 align:middle line:84%
in his book 'Penetration' but
it was more of a fiction."

00:36:48.973 --> 00:36:50.942 align:middle line:84%
You knew the guy,
what do you think?

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:51.776 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: I didn't know.

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:53.445 align:middle line:90%
I dedicate my book [inaudible]--

00:36:53.445 --> 00:36:54.579 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes, you do.

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:55.547 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: -- for which you
wrote the [inaudible].

00:36:55.547 --> 00:36:56.448 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I sure did.

00:36:56.448 --> 00:36:57.449 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what you see.

00:36:57.449 --> 00:36:58.583 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: I dedicated
it to [inaudible].

00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:00.285 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What did you
think of his thoughts

00:37:00.285 --> 00:37:02.821 align:middle line:90%
about the far side of the moon?

00:37:02.821 --> 00:37:04.789 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: There's stuff back there.

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:08.693 align:middle line:84%
Think that the-- the
Clementine mission,

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:10.061 align:middle line:90%
NASA's Clementine mission,

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:11.896 align:middle line:84%
it was supposed to
be for the public.

00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:14.065 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, the
Air Force took it over.

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:18.169 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- it's mapped 98
percent of the moon's surface

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:19.971 align:middle line:84%
but you can't get the
photography there.

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Well the Japanese are saying,
"Well, take a look here,

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.043 align:middle line:84%
in this crater, there's
this big cubicle structure,"

00:37:25.043 --> 00:37:25.977 align:middle line:90%
that's what we were seeing.

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:27.345 align:middle line:90%
Do we know what it's doing?

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:31.916 align:middle line:84%
We don't. We don't understand
it and we're talking perhaps

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:34.986 align:middle line:84%
if there's a federation
out there, and there is,

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:38.756 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
possible technologies,

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and I use that term
loosely, that are not 100--

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.629 align:middle line:84%
a million years in
advance of us,

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:46.698 align:middle line:90%
but perhaps 100 million years.

00:37:46.698 --> 00:37:47.732 align:middle line:90%
Scientists used to kind of--

00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:49.767 align:middle line:84%
I used to lead scientific
expeditions

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:52.637 align:middle line:90%
against these UFO sites.

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:54.005 align:middle line:90%
And they would ask me, "Ed,

00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:55.540 align:middle line:84%
what's the propulsion
system here?"

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.741 align:middle line:90%
And I said I don't know.

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:58.309 align:middle line:90%
It's just like an electron hole.

00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:59.844 align:middle line:84%
It's pulling itself
through space.

00:37:59.844 --> 00:38:02.914 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
propulsion system is.

00:38:02.914 --> 00:38:06.284 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How close is remote
viewing to being intuitive?

00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:08.286 align:middle line:90%
Is it one and the same?

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:11.122 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: We take the intuitive
ability, the innate ability,

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:12.657 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we
turn into a skill.

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:15.927 align:middle line:84%
This is like the ability for a
child to "ooh-ooh" and grunt,

00:38:15.927 --> 00:38:21.633 align:middle line:84%
we take that and we structure
it into a-- we have a structure,

00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:23.201 align:middle line:90%
whatever language, whatever--

00:38:23.201 --> 00:38:25.136 align:middle line:84%
and that's a ground we
have and we structure it.

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:27.906 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it values
itself of the same thing.

00:38:27.906 --> 00:38:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We needed-- - at CIA and Army,
we needed something psychically

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.250 align:middle line:84%
that could produce as
much technical information

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.386 align:middle line:84%
in a shorter period
of time as possible

00:38:41.386 --> 00:38:43.421 align:middle line:84%
and that's why this was
developed the way it

00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:45.023 align:middle line:90%
was developed.

00:38:45.023 --> 00:38:49.093 align:middle line:84%
But intuition, like the ability
to speak, is very tassel.

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:50.862 align:middle line:84%
You can learn any
number of language.

00:38:50.862 --> 00:38:53.198 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have-- we
can use our innate ability

00:38:53.198 --> 00:38:54.098 align:middle line:90%
to do many of the things.

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:55.433 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:56.834 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Not just remote viewing
in this the technical way.

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:59.337 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I'm going to do a little
experiment with the audience.

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:03.575 align:middle line:84%
And after it's done, tell
me what I did, if you would.

00:39:03.575 --> 00:39:06.844 align:middle line:84%
Now the probability of this
happening is 20 percent.

00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:10.815 align:middle line:84%
So that means 20 percent of
you should get this right.

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:13.585 align:middle line:84%
If it's higher than that, then
there's something going on here.

00:39:13.585 --> 00:39:18.189 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to send a number
to you between one and five.

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:21.192 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you
to just blank your mind

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:24.929 align:middle line:84%
and pretend the top of your
head right now is a chalkboard

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:26.064 align:middle line:90%
and don't think.

00:39:26.064 --> 00:39:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But when I tell you that
I've sent the number,

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:35.807 align:middle line:84%
write it on that mental
chalkboard and we'll do it now.

00:39:35.807 --> 00:39:41.112 align:middle line:84%
Think. OK, so I've
now sent you a number.

00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:46.718 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give you that
number and by show of hands--

00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:48.786 align:middle line:84%
now 20 percent of you
should have this right just

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:50.521 align:middle line:90%
for probability, right Ed?

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:52.323 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Right.

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:53.391 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Four.

00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:56.828 align:middle line:84%
No, it looks like
more than 20 percent.

00:39:56.828 --> 00:39:58.029 align:middle line:90%
So what did I do?

00:39:58.029 --> 00:39:59.597 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It's telepathy,
that's not remote viewing.

00:39:59.597 --> 00:40:00.932 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:40:00.932 --> 00:40:02.233 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: That's an energetic
concept with the audience too.

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.501 align:middle line:90%
I did the same thing.

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:07.772 align:middle line:84%
You need-- if you have a
group, a very powerful thing.

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:08.840 align:middle line:90%
It's very-- I mean I--

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.042 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: 'Cause I was
almost 50 percent.

00:40:11.042 --> 00:40:12.343 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Yeah.

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:15.146 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a group of
people, there is a dynamic--

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:18.149 align:middle line:84%
a synergistic dynamic
that's very, very different.

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:20.251 align:middle line:84%
For instance, let's
not kid ourselves here.

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.486 align:middle line:90%
At the unconscious level,

00:40:21.486 --> 00:40:24.022 align:middle line:84%
all of us are communicating
with each other.

00:40:24.022 --> 00:40:25.423 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:27.058 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: There's nothing hidden
at all at the unconscious level.

00:40:27.058 --> 00:40:30.461 align:middle line:84%
So, that cooperation right
there already existed

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:33.731 align:middle line:84%
in time before you did it
physically [inaudible].

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:38.503 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I had an 80 percent hit
rate with ex-wife doing that.

00:40:38.503 --> 00:40:39.637 align:middle line:90%
Eighty percent.

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:41.906 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, it got
down to like, 10 percent

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:44.909 align:middle line:90%
and I knew something was wrong.

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:47.578 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: I trained my sons
when they were young

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:50.481 align:middle line:84%
in both remote viewing and
telepathy and I used colors.

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:55.086 align:middle line:84%
And my oldest son got--
reached 100 percent.

00:40:55.086 --> 00:40:56.888 align:middle line:90%
But they can't do that with me

00:40:56.888 --> 00:40:58.389 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
the mental discipline.

00:40:58.389 --> 00:40:59.724 align:middle line:84%
"OK, dad, I'm thinking
of a color."

00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:00.858 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:01.959 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Because my
youngest son at eight is--

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:03.995 align:middle line:84%
pink, red, you know,
he can't hold a color,

00:41:03.995 --> 00:41:06.030 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't have the
discipline to do that.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.266 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's take some more
questions for Major Ed Dames.

00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:09.901 align:middle line:90%
Yes ma'am, way in the back.

00:41:09.901 --> 00:41:11.969 align:middle line:90%
>> Mr. Dames, do you believe

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:15.473 align:middle line:84%
that remote viewing
is on the increase?

00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:19.977 align:middle line:84%
And if it is, how can we tell
that we're being remote viewed?

00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:23.047 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: I think that remote
viewing is scarier to the powers

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:25.650 align:middle line:90%
to be-- than the internet.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:28.152 align:middle line:84%
The internet is the
scariest thing that there is.

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:33.091 align:middle line:84%
And it was too-- it happened
too late before the tripartite

00:41:33.091 --> 00:41:34.692 align:middle line:84%
and whatever you
want to call them,

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:38.029 align:middle line:84%
the Illuminati, realized
the danger.

00:41:38.029 --> 00:41:41.666 align:middle line:90%
But remote viewing, wait until--

00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:44.168 align:middle line:84%
when a threshold number of
people have been trained

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:47.739 align:middle line:84%
in remote viewing, and we're
getting there very, very close,

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:49.974 align:middle line:90%
now they have a real threat.

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:52.877 align:middle line:84%
Because, for instance-- and
I'll answer your other question

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:54.078 align:middle line:90%
in a moment.

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:57.281 align:middle line:84%
For instance, congressmen
who are on the Senate

00:41:57.281 --> 00:42:01.085 align:middle line:84%
and the House Intelligence
Committee would come up weekly

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:04.055 align:middle line:84%
because they were briefed on the
existence of our military unit.

00:42:04.055 --> 00:42:06.758 align:middle line:84%
They were scared to
death that we were going

00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:09.026 align:middle line:84%
to remote view them
because they had the most

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:10.128 align:middle line:90%
to hide, I'm not kidding.

00:42:10.128 --> 00:42:11.396 align:middle line:90%
And you guys know this.

00:42:11.396 --> 00:42:12.964 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- they're
scared to death.

00:42:12.964 --> 00:42:14.332 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid that
we were going to use it

00:42:14.332 --> 00:42:16.834 align:middle line:84%
against them 'cause they
had so much to hide.

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:20.605 align:middle line:84%
Well think about if thousands
of people have this ability.

00:42:20.605 --> 00:42:23.708 align:middle line:84%
Now they're in trouble,
worse so than the internet,

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:25.276 align:middle line:90%
which is going to be controlled

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:27.478 align:middle line:84%
because it represents
such a huge threat.

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:29.781 align:middle line:84%
Don't get yourself,
they're going to grab it.

00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:32.950 align:middle line:84%
How would you know if someone
was remote viewing you?

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.119 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't because
they're looking

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:38.022 align:middle line:84%
at you the way you exist
in another dimension.

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:40.124 align:middle line:90%
The pattern of you through time.

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:41.993 align:middle line:90%
If I want to remote view you,

00:42:41.993 --> 00:42:44.195 align:middle line:84%
I have to use a temporal
qualifier.

00:42:44.195 --> 00:42:46.063 align:middle line:90%
When do I want you in time?

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:49.167 align:middle line:84%
Birth, death, or
somewhere in between?

00:42:49.167 --> 00:42:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So there's not like
a remote viewer detector

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:53.704 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:54.572 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: No, there isn't.

00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:56.274 align:middle line:90%
For natural psychics, there is.

00:42:56.274 --> 00:42:57.775 align:middle line:90%
If you're-- for instance, the--

00:42:57.775 --> 00:43:02.513 align:middle line:90%
I personally led an attack

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:06.451 align:middle line:84%
against the erstwhile Soviet
Union's Soviet Defense Council.

00:43:06.451 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:84%
We kind of traded the
program, very interesting data,

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.988 align:middle line:84%
intelligence that we
gathered from them.

00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:13.224 align:middle line:90%
We used remote viewing for that.

00:43:13.224 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And we did that real
time during--

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.129 align:middle line:84%
when their meetings
were going on.

00:43:18.129 --> 00:43:22.467 align:middle line:84%
They had a very gifted natural
psychic in Moscow standing

00:43:22.467 --> 00:43:24.769 align:middle line:84%
in that meeting hall
saying, "Stop,"

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:25.736 align:middle line:84%
because he could
feel us [inaudible].

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:27.138 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: He could feel it, yeah.

00:43:27.138 --> 00:43:28.506 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: But that was different.

00:43:28.506 --> 00:43:31.242 align:middle line:84%
It was a real time attack
by a group of viewers

00:43:31.242 --> 00:43:33.611 align:middle line:90%
on them during the meeting.

00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:36.614 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the only way you
would know I'm remote viewing

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:40.318 align:middle line:84%
you is if you're sleeping
and, at the same time--

00:43:40.318 --> 00:43:43.054 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, I'm--
generally speaking,

00:43:43.054 --> 00:43:47.458 align:middle line:84%
there are some technicalities
about this--

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:49.460 align:middle line:84%
at the same time I was
remote viewing you,

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:53.764 align:middle line:84%
you might foresee me
in your dreams, OK?

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:56.534 align:middle line:84%
If a group of us were remote
viewing you during your sleep,

00:43:56.534 --> 00:44:00.571 align:middle line:84%
we could actually
interfere with your sleep.

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:01.272 align:middle line:90%
Unless--

00:44:01.272 --> 00:44:02.473 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You can change--

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:04.408 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Unless, you're
guardian angel stopped us.

00:44:04.408 --> 00:44:06.410 align:middle line:90%
By the angel [inaudible].

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.546 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Could you kill
somebody in a dream state?

00:44:08.546 --> 00:44:10.681 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: I don't think so.

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:12.617 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Make their heart
stop, something like that?

00:44:12.617 --> 00:44:14.118 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: The Russians
were trying to do that.

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:15.152 align:middle line:90%
They were experimenting

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:16.721 align:middle line:84%
with frog's hearts
and rabbit's hearts.

00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:19.524 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I met my counterpart,
the operations officer

00:44:19.524 --> 00:44:22.293 align:middle line:84%
of the KGB unit after
the Cold War was over,

00:44:22.293 --> 00:44:23.327 align:middle line:90%
Ivan Zakharov.

00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:24.829 align:middle line:90%
We go along famously.

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:28.232 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him about that
experiment and he said,

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:29.634 align:middle line:90%
"Yeah, it didn't work."

00:44:29.634 --> 00:44:32.003 align:middle line:84%
And the Secret Service knocked
on my door at Fort Meade once

00:44:32.003 --> 00:44:33.538 align:middle line:90%
and came up and said, "Look,

00:44:33.538 --> 00:44:40.044 align:middle line:84%
you published this
parapsychology advances

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:44.749 align:middle line:84%
in Eastern Europe,
special intelligence--

00:44:44.749 --> 00:44:46.951 align:middle line:84%
scientific intelligence
[inaudible]."

00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:47.652 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: A paper.

00:44:47.652 --> 00:44:48.219 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Yeah, a paper.

00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:49.453 align:middle line:90%
It's classified.

00:44:49.453 --> 00:44:52.690 align:middle line:84%
It goes around to different
people in the business.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.191 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
about these programs.

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:56.294 align:middle line:84%
We're worried about
President Reagan.

00:44:56.294 --> 00:44:58.396 align:middle line:90%
Can they affect him?

00:44:58.396 --> 00:45:01.866 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I took a
look at their program to see

00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:04.268 align:middle line:84%
if they could do that,
war in the ether,

00:45:04.268 --> 00:45:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I write about it in
the autobiography.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.406 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We had five guys who were
good all bombarding somebody.

00:45:08.406 --> 00:45:09.373 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Yeah, but they knew.

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:11.175 align:middle line:84%
They-- hey, they're
looking at us

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking
at them, all right?

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.546 align:middle line:84%
And so I told these Secret
Service guys, I said, "No,

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:18.749 align:middle line:84%
they can't"-- but they can't
do it but they can proceed,

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:23.321 align:middle line:84%
if they want to, everything
that's uppermost or deep mind

00:45:23.321 --> 00:45:24.722 align:middle line:90%
in President Reagan's mind.

00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:26.524 align:middle line:84%
So these guys said,
"Thank you very much.

00:45:26.524 --> 00:45:28.626 align:middle line:84%
That's all we need," because
they're not interested in that.

00:45:28.626 --> 00:45:31.062 align:middle line:84%
They're interested in
protecting the physicalness

00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:32.463 align:middle line:90%
of the president.

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:34.098 align:middle line:84%
They could care less about the
other stuff and not their job.

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:38.269 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's take another
Beyond Belief cam question

00:45:38.269 --> 00:45:39.670 align:middle line:90%
for Major Dames.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.672 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi Mr. Dames, I'm Leah

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:42.907 align:middle line:90%
from Los Angeles.

00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:47.144 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering, can anyone
become a remote viewer?

00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:49.513 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Yes, anyone can
become a remote viewer

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:52.016 align:middle line:84%
with a couple of
minor exceptions.

00:45:52.016 --> 00:45:56.187 align:middle line:84%
If you are-- you should
not try to remote view

00:45:56.187 --> 00:45:58.856 align:middle line:90%
if you're schizophrenic.

00:45:58.856 --> 00:46:03.094 align:middle line:84%
Schizophrenics, it'll-- learning
this changes your life forever.

00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:04.895 align:middle line:84%
You can never look at the
world the same way again

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:07.064 align:middle line:84%
because you know, you could
potentially know anything.

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:10.368 align:middle line:84%
For schizophrenic, they--
it'll take them over the edge.

00:46:10.368 --> 00:46:13.270 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:18.009 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably the only
type of person other than those

00:46:18.009 --> 00:46:22.179 align:middle line:84%
who don't want to learn that
can't learn remote viewing.

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:24.448 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's take one more
last question for the Major.

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:25.616 align:middle line:90%
Yes ma'am, right here.

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:27.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Ed, I'm Charlene Booth.

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:32.123 align:middle line:84%
Am I hearing you say that you
can remote view on the moon

00:46:32.123 --> 00:46:35.026 align:middle line:84%
and that you can remote
into someone's mind

00:46:35.026 --> 00:46:37.461 align:middle line:90%
to see what they're thinking?

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: We-- The targets that
we have are discrete targets,

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.704 align:middle line:84%
a person, place, thing or an
event, and problem targets,

00:46:46.704 --> 00:46:50.207 align:middle line:84%
who did it, where is it, how to
fix this, that kind of thing.

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:52.009 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the sky is the limit.

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And the moon of course?

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.145 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: The moon isn't--

00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:55.146 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's easy, isn't it?

00:46:55.146 --> 00:46:56.247 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: There's no
consequence to us.

00:46:56.247 --> 00:46:57.682 align:middle line:90%
>> But what's on the moon then?

00:46:57.682 --> 00:46:58.849 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Well there is a very--

00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:00.718 align:middle line:84%
there are some very
ancient structures that--

00:47:00.718 --> 00:47:03.954 align:middle line:84%
and we've gone back in time
just for fun to look at,

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:05.322 align:middle line:90%
you know, who put them there.

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:08.259 align:middle line:84%
Well we don't know who out them
there but there were small--

00:47:08.259 --> 00:47:11.328 align:middle line:84%
I will call them miners,
they were totally androids.

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:13.764 align:middle line:84%
I'll say androids for
lack of a better word.

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:16.100 align:middle line:90%
Robots who were mining the moon,

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.102 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know
how far back it was.

00:47:18.102 --> 00:47:20.471 align:middle line:84%
Some of their structures
are still there though.

00:47:20.471 --> 00:47:22.606 align:middle line:84%
They still extend
above surface.

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:25.109 align:middle line:84%
>> What about current things,
like when they were doing,

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:27.144 align:middle line:90%
you know, the Man on the Moon,

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:28.579 align:middle line:84%
if they were doing
the Man on the Moon?

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:29.947 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: They were being watched.

00:47:29.947 --> 00:47:32.283 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget that
the-- it isn't just--

00:47:32.283 --> 00:47:34.218 align:middle line:90%
we're not just being observed.

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:38.255 align:middle line:84%
We're being interfere-- there's
intervention, shutting the--

00:47:38.255 --> 00:47:40.291 align:middle line:84%
there's a system out
there and there are many,

00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:42.226 align:middle line:84%
many types of observers
out there.

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:45.129 align:middle line:84%
But there's one that
knows where every--

00:47:45.129 --> 00:47:49.333 align:middle line:84%
thank God, knows where every
single nuclear warhead is

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:52.837 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, whether it's
in storage, on a boomer,

00:47:52.837 --> 00:47:56.173 align:middle line:84%
on a missile, mounted
or not, on a B-52,

00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:58.542 align:middle line:90%
they know where every one is

00:47:58.542 --> 00:48:00.878 align:middle line:84%
and they can disable
them if they have to.

00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:04.148 align:middle line:84%
That's why there would never
have been a nuclear slug fest.

00:48:04.148 --> 00:48:08.219 align:middle line:84%
All that stuff we had to do as
kids under the desk at school--

00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:10.287 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I remember
those, scary times.

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:11.388 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: -- it was scary times.

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, there's
something out there

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:17.661 align:middle line:84%
where they'll never allow
this to have a slug fest.

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:21.699 align:middle line:84%
To understand the consequences
of Fukushima, the consequences

00:48:21.699 --> 00:48:24.135 align:middle line:90%
of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, yes,

00:48:24.135 --> 00:48:26.403 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand
the consequences.

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:28.906 align:middle line:84%
But to take this
planet out, this guard,

00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:30.908 align:middle line:90%
somebody out there is saying no.

00:48:30.908 --> 00:48:31.742 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:32.376 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Yeah, that's very good.

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:32.943 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Thank you.

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:34.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:48:34.311 --> 00:48:35.379 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do you ever get to a
point because of remote viewing

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:38.616 align:middle line:84%
where you just can't
shut your mind off?

00:48:38.616 --> 00:48:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: No-- I never have that.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And if you
sleep OK and stuff.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.021 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: No, I don't.

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:44.955 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Say--

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: I don't sleep
but it's not

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.391 align:middle line:90%
because of that, I don't think.

00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:48.259 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it's because.

00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:49.059 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It might be.

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.694 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: It might be insomnia.

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:53.030 align:middle line:90%
But I-- most all of my time--

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.733 align:middle line:84%
I'd say 80 percent of my
time is missing children.

00:48:55.733 --> 00:48:56.801 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do--

00:48:56.801 --> 00:48:58.302 align:middle line:84%
this other stuff I
do because I have to.

00:48:58.302 --> 00:48:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:00.404 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: The missing
children is my personal.

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:01.272 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well that's
consultancy company

00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:02.439 align:middle line:90%
through the Matrix, isn't it?

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:03.641 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: No.

00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:06.177 align:middle line:84%
Matrix Intelligence Agency
is a contract company--

00:49:06.177 --> 00:49:07.411 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Private consulting, OK.

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:08.579 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: -- firm, and
we do other--

00:49:08.579 --> 00:49:09.713 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's something else.

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:11.849 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: The children
are-- we do that gratis.

00:49:11.849 --> 00:49:13.083 align:middle line:90%
We pay for our own trips.

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:14.118 align:middle line:90%
We--

00:49:14.118 --> 00:49:14.952 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But do you
have to get summoned

00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:17.087 align:middle line:90%
by the feds or by the police?

00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:19.723 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: I choose them on
a case by case basis.

00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:22.193 align:middle line:84%
And all the cases,
almost all the cases,

00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:25.563 align:middle line:84%
are missing endangered, a
missing endangered child.

00:49:25.563 --> 00:49:27.898 align:middle line:90%
I won't go after runaways or--

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:29.200 align:middle line:84%
unless they're missing
endangered.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.467 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: 'Cause it's not a--
our resources are limited.

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:33.904 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How many missing
children are there

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:35.539 align:middle line:90%
in this country, a lot?

00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:36.674 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Right now?

00:49:36.674 --> 00:49:37.241 align:middle line:90%
Right now?

00:49:37.241 --> 00:49:38.008 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:39.944 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Oh, at least 1,600.

00:49:39.944 --> 00:49:43.781 align:middle line:84%
Missing endangered,
though, they're dead.

00:49:43.781 --> 00:49:48.819 align:middle line:84%
A child, male or female, is
usually raped and murdered

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:50.187 align:middle line:90%
within the first four hours.

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We have that many sickos
running around this country?

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:54.291 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: It's epidemic--

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:56.994 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] conference
has an epidemic.

00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:59.597 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let me ask you about
something that's been happening

00:49:59.597 --> 00:50:04.935 align:middle line:84%
on the western coast shores, up
to-- up on the northern states.

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:08.806 align:middle line:84%
Feet have been showing
up, British Columbia--

00:50:08.806 --> 00:50:09.506 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Right.

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: -- in like feet.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.408 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Vancouver.

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:13.344 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Some of them with a
shoe on, some of them not.

00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:15.312 align:middle line:84%
What the heck is
happening there?

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:17.014 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Yeah, I though
that was interesting

00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:18.883 align:middle line:84%
but I have not had the
time to look at it.

00:50:18.883 --> 00:50:20.751 align:middle line:90%
The way we would target it is--

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:23.153 align:middle line:84%
our best way of targeting
'cause we want chain

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:25.456 align:middle line:90%
of custody is we would very much

00:50:25.456 --> 00:50:27.758 align:middle line:84%
like to have a photo
of one of the feet.

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:28.692 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:30.194 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: OK, because
then we have--

00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:32.329 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to
describe the target.

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:34.698 align:middle line:84%
The foot that was discovered
on this particular beach

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:35.833 align:middle line:90%
at this time, blah, blah, blah.

00:50:35.833 --> 00:50:38.102 align:middle line:84%
If we have a photo,
it's wonderful.

00:50:38.102 --> 00:50:41.505 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: To me, it's a serial
killer or some kind of cult--

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:42.306 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: We--

00:50:42.306 --> 00:50:43.374 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: -- initiation thing.

00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:44.642 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: That's an
interesting point because,

00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:47.144 align:middle line:84%
as remote viewers, we are
taught to enter a problem

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:49.747 align:middle line:84%
with no preconceived
notions, whatsoever.

00:50:49.747 --> 00:50:52.383 align:middle line:84%
If the cop say, "This body
was cast out off the car

00:50:52.383 --> 00:50:55.486 align:middle line:84%
after it was murdered," we just
say, "We'll take care of it,

00:50:55.486 --> 00:50:57.655 align:middle line:84%
we'll look into it," because
it could've been a teenager

00:50:57.655 --> 00:51:00.858 align:middle line:84%
who OD'd in a car and they
panicked, buddies threw him

00:51:00.858 --> 00:51:02.426 align:middle line:84%
out of it, it wasn't
a murder at all.

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:05.095 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any biases
when we go into a problem.

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:06.096 align:middle line:84%
The missing feet
could be some monster

00:51:06.096 --> 00:51:08.632 align:middle line:90%
that we never discovered.

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:10.434 align:middle line:84%
Anything, there's
room for anything

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:11.835 align:middle line:90%
out there in the cosmos.

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:13.203 align:middle line:90%
Or, you probably right.

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:16.407 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you're probably right,
but we don't assume anything.

00:51:16.407 --> 00:51:17.775 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: So maybe that thought

00:51:17.775 --> 00:51:19.743 align:middle line:84%
about a serial killer
is the intuitive part

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:21.211 align:middle line:90%
of me that kicked in.

00:51:21.211 --> 00:51:22.479 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It could be
the intuitive part.

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:25.649 align:middle line:84%
But more than likely, it's
the-- your knowledge base,

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:29.453 align:middle line:84%
because you-- your
knowledge base combined

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:33.190 align:middle line:84%
with your imagination,
combined with your fear.

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.626 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: The Killshot, by the way,
as I mentioned, you're all going

00:51:35.626 --> 00:51:38.028 align:middle line:90%
to get a copy of this.

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:39.663 align:middle line:90%
The sun is heating up.

00:51:39.663 --> 00:51:41.932 align:middle line:90%
We're in a solar maximus.

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:44.168 align:middle line:90%
Its magnetic poles are shifting.

00:51:44.168 --> 00:51:47.171 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are already
saying that.

00:51:47.171 --> 00:51:48.939 align:middle line:90%
And this could happen soon.

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:51.809 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Yes, we believe,
based on our work,

00:51:51.809 --> 00:51:58.048 align:middle line:84%
is the best that we can do that
it's eminent with 2013-2014.

00:51:58.048 --> 00:51:59.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the best that we can do.

00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:01.318 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You're talking like
an X flares that shuts

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:02.653 align:middle line:90%
down the grid and everything.

00:52:02.653 --> 00:52:04.688 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: We're talking about a
number, a number of flares,

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:07.424 align:middle line:84%
a number of very large
flares that take out a lot

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:09.660 align:middle line:84%
of satellites, a
lot of satellites

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.562 align:middle line:90%
that take down power grids too.

00:52:11.562 --> 00:52:14.932 align:middle line:84%
So the number of deaths,
the many millions of death--

00:52:14.932 --> 00:52:16.834 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: People will die because
of these things shutting down,

00:52:16.834 --> 00:52:17.868 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:52:17.868 --> 00:52:19.136 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Indirectly,
indirectly, yes too.

00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:21.739 align:middle line:84%
And the-- a huge fear, and
I'm sure some of you are--

00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:24.908 align:middle line:84%
this is going through your
minds, there's a whole bunch

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:27.111 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear reactors around
the Great Lake states--

00:52:27.111 --> 00:52:28.145 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's huge.

00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:29.513 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: -- and around
your hometown too.

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:30.781 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes.

00:52:30.781 --> 00:52:32.816 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: And if they lose
power, those diesel generators

00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:36.353 align:middle line:84%
that cool those plants
can only work for so long.

00:52:36.353 --> 00:52:37.354 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And then they shut down.

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:38.022 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: When they stop--

00:52:38.022 --> 00:52:38.856 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:52:38.856 --> 00:52:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: -- got another Fukushima.

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:40.724 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You're absolutely right.

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:42.126 align:middle line:84%
That, I think, is
the biggest problem

00:52:42.126 --> 00:52:44.261 align:middle line:90%
and it's not being recognized.

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:46.096 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple
of people out there

00:52:46.096 --> 00:52:49.199 align:middle line:84%
who have written some
stories about it.

00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:51.268 align:middle line:84%
They've tried to
notify Congress.

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:52.669 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is doing anything
about it.

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:54.972 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: George, we let the genie
out of the bottle and it's--

00:52:54.972 --> 00:52:56.473 align:middle line:90%
we can't put it back in.

00:52:56.473 --> 00:53:01.178 align:middle line:84%
You know, nuclear power,
nuclear anything, it is the gift

00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:04.281 align:middle line:84%
that keeps on giving--
the weapons themselves,

00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:08.085 align:middle line:84%
a nuclear weapon is
the epitome of madness.

00:53:08.085 --> 00:53:09.086 align:middle line:90%
It's the epitome of madness.

00:53:09.086 --> 00:53:10.254 align:middle line:90%
A nuclear weapon?

00:53:10.254 --> 00:53:12.589 align:middle line:84%
How many times over could
we hope to destroy--

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:13.424 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Each other.

00:53:13.424 --> 00:53:14.525 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: -- each other, yeah.

00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:19.463 align:middle line:84%
And-- But we're not
good wards of our world,

00:53:19.463 --> 00:53:20.097 align:middle line:90%
of this garden of the world.

00:53:20.097 --> 00:53:22.933 align:middle line:90%
It's-- We're going down.

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:24.768 align:middle line:84%
That's why they call
me Dr. Doom.

00:53:24.768 --> 00:53:26.537 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: If you were
addressing the people

00:53:26.537 --> 00:53:30.407 align:middle line:84%
who were contemplating
having children and you're

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:34.244 align:middle line:84%
at this big conference of all
these perspective parents,

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:36.747 align:middle line:84%
what would you tell
them about the future?

00:53:36.747 --> 00:53:38.549 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: I would tell them
exactly what I told you

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:39.950 align:middle line:90%
and have told everybody else.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:44.755 align:middle line:84%
But I think, you know,
I'm contemplating

00:53:44.755 --> 00:53:48.892 align:middle line:84%
and my wife-to-be is
contemplating having a child.

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:50.794 align:middle line:90%
I've always wanted a daughter.

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:54.832 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting
to question whether

00:53:54.832 --> 00:53:56.300 align:middle line:90%
or not that's a good idea.

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.303 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Because of
things to come?

00:53:59.303 --> 00:54:00.604 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: The horrible
things to come, yeah,

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:03.140 align:middle line:84%
except in certain
areas of the planet.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:03.974 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: [Inaudible]
the three ghosts

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:05.809 align:middle line:90%
from the Christmas Carol movie.

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:08.412 align:middle line:84%
Scrooge, are these
things to come?

00:54:08.412 --> 00:54:09.613 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: The things to come.

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:10.914 align:middle line:90%
Well, as remote viewers,

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:13.417 align:middle line:84%
the things that we can pick
easily are the very large

00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:14.418 align:middle line:84%
events, the very
large [inaudible].

00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:15.552 align:middle line:90%
That's why we picked

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:18.055 align:middle line:84%
up the global economic
collapse gold of 2000.

00:54:18.055 --> 00:54:19.923 align:middle line:84%
People said "ha-ha-ha"
about that, right?

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:22.025 align:middle line:90%
OK, well it's here.

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:25.829 align:middle line:84%
Massive disease, a global
pandemic, we picked that up,

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:28.932 align:middle line:84%
not on the heels of a
global economic collapse,

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:30.634 align:middle line:90%
but concurrent with it.

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:34.805 align:middle line:84%
That means, as we go
down over the next year,

00:54:34.805 --> 00:54:38.509 align:middle line:84%
economically worldwide, this
pandemic that we've discovered,

00:54:38.509 --> 00:54:42.446 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure whether it's
a hybrid between swine flu

00:54:42.446 --> 00:54:45.616 align:middle line:84%
and bird flu or something
else, but it's very large.

00:54:45.616 --> 00:54:48.819 align:middle line:84%
It's so large that you're
going to need lime pits

00:54:48.819 --> 00:54:52.556 align:middle line:84%
to handle dead people like
they do in the Bubonic plague.

00:54:52.556 --> 00:54:53.891 align:middle line:90%
It's very large.

00:54:53.891 --> 00:54:57.194 align:middle line:84%
And we picked that up and
obviously there this continuity

00:54:57.194 --> 00:55:00.464 align:middle line:84%
in cultural evolution that
I've called The Killshot.

00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:01.098 align:middle line:84%
Those events can be
picked up readily.

00:55:01.098 --> 00:55:05.068 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think the
profits of old had no problem

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:07.237 align:middle line:84%
because they're totally
gifted psychics.

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:09.706 align:middle line:84%
They're picking up things
thousands of years hence

00:55:09.706 --> 00:55:12.009 align:middle line:84%
and that's-- and
because they're big.

00:55:12.009 --> 00:55:16.146 align:middle line:84%
They loom largely on
scale of human evolution.

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:19.883 align:middle line:84%
And the consequences are so
great, yeah, you're going

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:22.386 align:middle line:84%
to pick it up, and your
unconscious is your best friend.

00:55:22.386 --> 00:55:25.289 align:middle line:84%
The first priority is
to take care of you.

00:55:25.289 --> 00:55:27.357 align:middle line:84%
But we normally don't
listen to that.

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:30.027 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Ed, remote
viewing of the future.

00:55:30.027 --> 00:55:33.697 align:middle line:84%
Are they events that
will we or could be?

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:35.199 align:middle line:90%
Can we alter it?

00:55:35.199 --> 00:55:38.335 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: If a remote viewer
can pick up an event that's

00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:40.971 align:middle line:84%
in the future, it
already exists in time.

00:55:40.971 --> 00:55:41.939 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It can't be stopped?

00:55:41.939 --> 00:55:43.273 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: It can not be stopped.

00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:46.944 align:middle line:84%
But as-- an individual
can choose whether or not,

00:55:46.944 --> 00:55:49.546 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, to participate
in that event.

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:50.414 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Or protect themselves--

00:55:50.414 --> 00:55:52.616 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: But I must-- right.

00:55:52.616 --> 00:55:55.652 align:middle line:84%
But that choice in time
has already been made.

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:59.022 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: OK, so case in point,
the X flare from the sun,

00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:02.859 align:middle line:84%
you see it happening, so we have
to assume it's going to happen.

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:06.330 align:middle line:84%
The altering of the future
could be governments saying,

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:10.167 align:middle line:84%
"We just heard Major Dames,
we need to insulate the grid.

00:56:10.167 --> 00:56:13.503 align:middle line:84%
We need to protect ourselves
to minimize the problem."

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:16.106 align:middle line:90%
That can be done.

00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:16.907 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: It could be done--

00:56:16.907 --> 00:56:17.908 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: The event happens--

00:56:17.908 --> 00:56:18.709 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: But if it
can be done, it's--

00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:19.977 align:middle line:90%
it already happened in time.

00:56:19.977 --> 00:56:20.877 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:21.445 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Yes.

00:56:21.445 --> 00:56:22.212 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:22.913 align:middle line:90%
I mean the event happens.

00:56:22.913 --> 00:56:23.981 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: There's a choice.

00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:24.681 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: They're going
to get the X flare.

00:56:24.681 --> 00:56:25.849 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: A choice on mind.

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:27.251 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But you can
protect yourself, you know.

00:56:27.251 --> 00:56:30.887 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of the great
ways of using remote viewing is

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:34.391 align:middle line:84%
to be able to stop yourself
from getting involved.

00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:36.426 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: It's a paradox,
I think, a paradox,

00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:38.128 align:middle line:84%
'cause it's already
happened, you know, it--

00:56:38.128 --> 00:56:40.063 align:middle line:90%
these are the kinds of questions

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:43.467 align:middle line:84%
that the Buddhists say
don't drive men mad,

00:56:43.467 --> 00:56:44.735 align:middle line:90%
don't ask them, you know.

00:56:44.735 --> 00:56:46.403 align:middle line:84%
If God is so great,
can He Himself build--

00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:48.238 align:middle line:84%
you know, make a rock
that He can pick up.

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:49.806 align:middle line:90%
He's going to-- that's--

00:56:49.806 --> 00:56:50.641 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:56:50.641 --> 00:56:51.842 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: This is my [inaudible].

00:56:51.842 --> 00:56:53.777 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But I think people
sometimes remote view

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:55.779 align:middle line:90%
when they get an instinct.

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:59.116 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're driving a car
and they say, "You know,

00:56:59.116 --> 00:57:01.051 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go
through this intersection,"

00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:03.153 align:middle line:84%
that's happened to
me and I don't.

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:04.054 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: That's pure intuition.

00:57:04.054 --> 00:57:05.689 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And a car goes through.

00:57:05.689 --> 00:57:07.057 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I saw the future too.

00:57:07.057 --> 00:57:08.892 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Yeah, yeah,
that's pure intuition.

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:12.329 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, actually, I'm saying
yes, and that's pure intuition.

00:57:12.329 --> 00:57:15.866 align:middle line:84%
We just take that and greatly
structure it because our demands

00:57:15.866 --> 00:57:20.203 align:middle line:84%
on what is inside this weapon,
how does it work and all that,

00:57:20.203 --> 00:57:23.707 align:middle line:84%
are so technologically
detailed that we have to do more

00:57:23.707 --> 00:57:25.609 align:middle line:90%
that the Oracle at Delphi did.

00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:29.346 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, General Horatio's
army is going to flank you

00:57:29.346 --> 00:57:30.480 align:middle line:90%
from the south," and all that.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.782 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Right, and cut
right through you.

00:57:31.782 --> 00:57:33.684 align:middle line:84%
How many of you practice
remote viewing?

00:57:33.684 --> 00:57:35.519 align:middle line:90%
How many even tried?

00:57:35.519 --> 00:57:38.121 align:middle line:90%
Are you pretty successful?

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:39.723 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes?

00:57:39.723 --> 00:57:42.125 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: She's a ringer, though,
because she's my student.

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:42.826 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I am.

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.027 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh, a student.

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:46.096 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: She lives in Denver.

00:57:46.096 --> 00:57:47.497 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Super.

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:48.365 align:middle line:90%
He's good.

00:57:48.365 --> 00:57:50.534 align:middle line:90%
He knows what he's doing.

00:57:50.534 --> 00:57:51.768 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
keep doing this?

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Does Ed Dames ever stop?

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:54.705 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: Yeah, Dames would stop.

00:57:54.705 --> 00:57:57.307 align:middle line:84%
I've reached-- I've trained
enough professionals now

00:57:57.307 --> 00:58:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and I've helped them set
up their own companies,

00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:02.079 align:middle line:90%
their own enterprises.

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:04.715 align:middle line:84%
I'm very proud of
them and I'm proud

00:58:04.715 --> 00:58:07.417 align:middle line:90%
of myself that I created them.

00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:10.587 align:middle line:84%
And that-- 'cause I did not
feel I could exit stage left

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:11.888 align:middle line:90%
until I did that.

00:58:11.888 --> 00:58:15.792 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I need to
retire, I need a break.

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:21.098 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I'm
retired from army was

00:58:21.098 --> 00:58:29.272 align:middle line:84%
because we could not use this
unit to study the UFO phenomena.

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:29.973 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:31.041 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: And--

00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:32.142 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And you wanted to?

00:58:32.142 --> 00:58:33.176 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: -- that was my passion.

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:34.244 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:36.012 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: So for the
last 20 years, I've--

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:38.448 align:middle line:84%
and I've [inaudible] about
them, many scientists know me.

00:58:38.448 --> 00:58:44.421 align:middle line:84%
But now, I've pulled all of
my assets in, I don't work

00:58:44.421 --> 00:58:47.057 align:middle line:84%
with anybody in the
[inaudible] anymore.

00:58:47.057 --> 00:58:48.725 align:middle line:90%
I want contact.

00:58:48.725 --> 00:58:52.696 align:middle line:84%
I feel that contact is so
important in the future

00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:55.432 align:middle line:84%
of this planet because when
we rebuild this planet,

00:58:55.432 --> 00:59:00.337 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have to do
that when we rebuild our culture

00:59:00.337 --> 00:59:03.206 align:middle line:84%
into something I hope
is called civilization,

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.208 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
to do it with help

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:07.944 align:middle line:84%
because we'll make the
same mistakes again.

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:09.279 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Well, you know,

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:11.581 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed a few military
folks, Ed, who have worked

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:14.050 align:middle line:90%
at missile silos and they say

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:16.620 align:middle line:84%
that UFOs had literally
shut them down.

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:17.888 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: Yes, and I'm
quite aware of that.

00:59:17.888 --> 00:59:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Just to let them
know we can do this.

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: But what I've done is
I've taken those particular

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:26.396 align:middle line:84%
objects and actually in at some
cases, they weren't objects,

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:30.167 align:middle line:84%
they were plasma creations, but
that-- that not what's standing,

00:59:30.167 --> 00:59:32.502 align:middle line:84%
and follow them back
to where they are.

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:35.605 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to knock on
that door, literally.

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:39.309 align:middle line:84%
Because one of those particular,
let's call, the base for lack

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:42.078 align:middle line:84%
of a better word, is on
the surface of this planet.

00:59:42.078 --> 00:59:43.713 align:middle line:90%
I want to see what happen--

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:46.483 align:middle line:84%
actually I'm going to send
in my business partner

00:59:46.483 --> 00:59:48.251 align:middle line:84%
and see what happens
to him first.

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:48.785 align:middle line:90%
If he's--

00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:50.854 align:middle line:84%
>> ED: If he's vaporized,
I will run.

00:59:50.854 --> 00:59:51.855 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That's right,
I don't blame you.

00:59:51.855 --> 00:59:53.423 align:middle line:90%
>> ED: But no, I want contact.

00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:56.526 align:middle line:84%
I want to try to-- I feel that
if we ask for help, you know,

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:59.596 align:middle line:90%
it's better than nothing.

00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.598 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Major Ed Dames,
it's called The Killshot,

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:04.601 align:middle line:90%
you will all get one, thank you.
