>>GEORGE NOORY:
Does the ghost have

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.950 align:middle line:84%
to have died as a human
at that spot to haunt it?

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS ALLISON: No.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of stories,
especially Abraham Lincoln

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.640 align:middle line:84%
has a very famous
case where he's

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.410 align:middle line:84%
been seen haunting
the White House,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.420 align:middle line:84%
he's been seen haunting
the theater where

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.310 align:middle line:84%
he was assassinated,
he's even been

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:84%
seen in the house
across the street

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
where he was taken
after he was shot.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: It can be
definitely startling.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
There are some videos
of me screaming.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shocked you?

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've had situations where
things have been thrown at me,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:90%
doors slamming in front of me.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:90%

Ross, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, it's
an honor to be here.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your reputation, by
the way, precedes yourself.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:90%
People love your work.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.425 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Well, thank you.

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:10%
It's been a hard journey,
but I've kept up with it,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:10%
especially when you really
don't make a lot of money

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:10%
being a ghost hunter.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:84%
It all comes out
of your own pocket.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:90%
But I really enjoy doing this.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.388 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: I blame my mother.

00:01:25.388 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I have a mother that
loves ghost stories.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up
listening to stories,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and just wanted to
know, do people really

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:90%
experience this stuff?

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was that curiosity that
really started the spark,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:90%
and I just continued on with it.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She would tell you
these stories as a little boy,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:90%
and you'd just grasp them, huh?

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: I did.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I definitely had to
sleep with a nightlight.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you
found with this whole genre

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:90%
about ghosts?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: I have found
that there is definitely

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:10%
some sort of intelligence
when it comes to a haunting,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:10%
when you go into a place and
ask questions into the air,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:10%
and you play a recording,
and there is a response.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:10%
There's something to that.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.634 align:middle line:84%
And it's just
those little things

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:84%
that just keep driving you
further and further down

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.559 align:middle line:90%
the path.

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:11.162 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a ghost?

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, that's
a tough question,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot
of different beliefs

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to ghosts.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:84%
You have your most common
belief that it is the spirit

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.790 align:middle line:90%
of somebody that has passed on.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But then when you try to
bring science into it,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
you really have to dive into
the technology and the data

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and see if there's anything
to validate these experiences.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's where my path
has kind of taken me.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I want that data to
validate these experiences.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where will
you go to investigate

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:90%
ghosts and hauntings?

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.475 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Anywhere I'm invited.

00:02:44.475 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wherever
you have to go.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.717 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I've been
all over the world,

00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
from castles,
churches, hospitals,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:90%
to apartment buildings.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say is
the most profound thing that

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.050 align:middle line:90%
has ever happened on a hunt?

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh, gosh.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say when I was
investigating an old school--

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:84%
college, university-- and it
was known for a very famous case

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:90%
called the Exorcist.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into the room,
and all my equipment went off

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:90%
at the exact same time.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
"the" Exorcist story?

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: The
Exorcist case, yes.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A little
boy from Baltimore--

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Exactly.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --ended
up in St. Louis.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yes, I was invited
to the campus to do my lecture.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And when they had
me on the campus,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
they let me do a ghost
hunt with the students.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And they took me to the building
where the boy had actually

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:90%
stayed.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And it was
pretty interesting

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
because the building
itself, the fourth floor

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:90%
was completely abandoned.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand why
they didn't utilize the space

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.713 align:middle line:90%
because it was huge up there.

00:03:53.713 --> 00:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And as we walked around
doing our ghost hunt--

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You found out.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I found out that they've
had problems up there,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and they are referring
to paranormal problems.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The little boy
is now a grown adult.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Living somewhere.

00:04:05.355 --> 00:04:06.155 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Mm-hmm.

00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I guess he doesn't want
anything to do with that story.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: No.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:90%
In fact--

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't blame him.

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: He even claims he
doesn't remember a lot of it.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.253 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
possible too, right?

00:04:16.253 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: So when you go into a
room where an exorcism had been

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
committed, and then you
actually pick up a voice

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.200 align:middle line:90%
on your recorder that says--

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.720 align:middle line:84%
when you ask, can you tell
me whose room this is?

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And it says, F you, it's
mine, that's pretty intense.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of the exorcists
were doing the cleansing

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:90%
at the hospital.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.710 align:middle line:84%
It was the Alexian
Brothers Hospital.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Two priests were
involved, right?

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Right.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
both deceased now.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating story.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And then to have the
opportunity to investigate

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
one of the secret rooms--
because they had moved them

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:84%
to various different
locations before he ended up

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.040 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital for
the last exorcism.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting to
be in one of those rooms

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.720 align:middle line:84%
where an exorcism
had been performed.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing work.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And scary too.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: It can be.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:84%
It can be,
definitely, startling.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
There are some videos
of me screaming.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shocked you?

00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've had situations where
things have been thrown at me,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.700 align:middle line:90%
doors slamming in front of me.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever been hurt?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.913 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: I haven't been hurt.

00:05:24.913 --> 00:05:25.955 align:middle line:90%
I'm always very careful--

00:05:25.955 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Knock on wood.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: --when I go in.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After the
exorcism in the hospital,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
they sold off all the furniture
that was in the hospital room,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and the people who
ended up buying it,

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.550 align:middle line:84%
different families, all reported
strange unusual paranormal

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:84%
experiences attached
to these objects.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Oh
yeah, I believe it.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I got to
investigate the room

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:90%
that the boy had stayed in.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.955 align:middle line:84%
And this room was filled
with dead birds and--

00:05:56.955 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dead birds?

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Dead birds.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.917 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and there was
no doors up there too,

00:06:00.917 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
because security had removed all
the doors on the fourth floor

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:84%
because they have had problems
with students constantly

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:84%
sneaking up there
to scare each other.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So they had removed
the doors, so the birds

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.420 align:middle line:84%
had access to the
whole fourth floor,

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:84%
but they all chose to
die in this one room.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that security
actually used to use this room.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
They used to store
their bikes there.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And when they'd go to
collect their bikes,

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:84%
they'd find the chains had
been ripped off the bikes,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:84%
the handlebars would
be bent around.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.113 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah, so
there's definitely

00:06:29.113 --> 00:06:31.610 align:middle line:84%
some energy attached
to these objects

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and even to the places
where it happened.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Ross, what
are haunted objects?

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, when you
get into haunted objects,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:84%
especially when it comes
to toys are very popular,

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:84%
you have some sort of
energy attached to it.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:90%
This could be--

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Negative energy.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: It could be negative.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.208 align:middle line:90%
It could be positive as well.

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: There's a lot
of situations with toys,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:90%
especially with children.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Children can become
very obsessed with a toy

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and they find that,
a lot of times,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that obsession, that energy,
can be absorbed by the toy.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.685 align:middle line:84%
Or you have the situation
where dolls can be possessed.

00:07:08.685 --> 00:07:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Chucky.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Like Chucky, exactly.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Or there's situations where
an object can be cursed,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:84%
where somebody intentionally
puts a curse on an object

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:90%
and passes it on to the victim.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On your tours that
you have in the Seattle area,

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:84%
you have literally
written the guide

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.320 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of
haunted objects.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.708 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at some of
these artifacts from your tour.

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:35.201 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:40.132 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.132 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: All right,
welcome, everybody,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:10%
to Spooked in Seattle tours.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm Ross Allison,
your tour guide,

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:10%
and I'll be giving you guys a
tour of our haunted objects,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.497 align:middle line:10%
some of our death
memorabilia back here,

00:07:51.497 --> 00:07:54.080 align:middle line:10%
and of course I'll take you to
a few places throughout Seattle

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:10%
and tell you some of the
spooky, scary ghost stories.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:10%
When we talk about
death memorabilia,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about
embalming tools,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about
funerals, mourning attire.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:10%
So this is Mr. Creepy.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:10%
He goes back to
the 1960s, when he

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:10%
was created by a retired
ventriloquist artist.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:10%
And he made this
doll in his likeness

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:10%
that you can actually see there.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:10%
What makes these
dolls really creepy

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:10%
is they actually use their
real hair on the dolls.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:10%
So I brought them
to our old location.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:10%
And we had them in a different
glass case at the time.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:10%
And I was alone in the store.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:10%
I was doing something
in the office when I

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle line:10%
heard this thud against glass.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.750 align:middle line:10%
Now, I immediately
thought something

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:10%
happened in the gift shop.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.890 align:middle line:10%
So I go out and I'm looking
around to see what had fallen

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.539 align:middle line:10%
or what that noise
could have been.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.164 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't find
anything disturbed.

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:44.270 align:middle line:10%
So I start walking around.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:10%
And as I'm walking around these
huge tables we used to have,

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:10%
and I come face
to face with him,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:10%
I see that his head is
now turned and leaning up

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.070 align:middle line:10%
against the glass.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:10%
So I immediately
take a picture of it.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:10%
And to my surprise,
when I reviewed

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.010 align:middle line:10%
the photo in the photo,
you can see his head

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.230 align:middle line:10%
leaning up against the
glass, but in the reflection

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:10%
of the glass itself, you don't
see the reflection of him,

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.280 align:middle line:10%
you see the reflection of him.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times, when you're
talking about haunted objects,

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.537 align:middle line:10%
there's usually
different reasons

00:09:19.537 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:10%
why they could be haunted.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:10%
With children,
especially with toys,

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.340 align:middle line:10%
they put a lot of
their energy into it.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of that love and
energy, even obsessive energy,

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:10%
can be put into
these toys and that's

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:10%
how they create a
spirit of their own.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:10%
But then you also
have situations

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:10%
where spirits are
attracted to dolls

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:10%
because they do represent
the human figure

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:10%
and so they will possess
some of these toys.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:10%
But then there's also curses.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.416 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes somebody can put a
curse on a toy or an object.

00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:55.846 align:middle line:10%
[DISSONANT MUSIC SWELLS]

00:09:57.468 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't know
what's scarier there, Ross,

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.932 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Creepy or you in that hat.

00:10:01.932 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.520 align:middle line:90%
That doll looked really weird.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there is a female
counterpart of that doll.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
The gentleman who made it, as I
said, made it in his likeness.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.760 align:middle line:84%
But he also made one
in his wife's likeness.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mrs. Creepy?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Mrs. Creepy.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And they have been
separated since the day

after they were created.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.012 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason why he
is seen moving around a lot--

00:10:31.012 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
he'll be looking in
different directions,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:84%
his eyes will be looking
different directions--

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:84%
I think he's just
looking for her.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So I have been
trying to find her

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:84%
so I can bring those
two souls together.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is he still
with his wife as well?

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Or are they separated too?

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, they
died a long time ago.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they did.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk a
little bit about residual

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:90%
versus intelligent ghosts.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, a
residual haunting

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:84%
is where a memory is just
trapped in the environment,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and it just plays itself out
over and over and over again.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.610 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't really
interact with the environment

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:84%
or even the living, where
an intelligent haunting

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.790 align:middle line:84%
is something that will
interact with the environment,

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:90%
will interact with the living.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you have equipment
out, it will sometimes

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:90%
respond to that equipment.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
You can ask questions
into the air

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get an
answer to that question.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a
couple of balls here

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and a couple of little
Scrabble pellets.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: I do.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I brought some of
the basic equipment

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:84%
that we can use on ghost hunts,
stuff that's not expensive.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So anybody can get out
there and use these.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And the balls are very
popular because they're

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:90%
easy to be manipulated.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.208 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have ping
pong balls here.

00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:84%
These are glow-in-the-dark
ping pong balls.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:90%
And they're very, very light.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So these will sometimes
move around on their own.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we have balls
here that actually light up

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.520 align:middle line:90%
whenever they're moved.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And those are great
for experiments.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.400 align:middle line:84%
We've set them up down
hallways, and you'll

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
see them go down the hallway,
and they'll start to light up,

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:84%
one by one, showing that
there's something moving down

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:02.990 align:middle line:90%
the hallway.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.347 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you seen the
lights go on like that?

00:12:05.347 --> 00:12:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah, quite often.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.680 align:middle line:90%
And then we have Scrabble tiles.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Scrabble tiles is
another just simple tool

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:90%
that you can lay out on a table.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.890 align:middle line:90%
Take a photo of it.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you come back,
hopefully the Scrabble tiles

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:19.520 align:middle line:90%
will be moved out.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll
spell out a message.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, people like to
put the Y and the N upwards.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, if
there's somebody here,

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.132 align:middle line:84%
could you please tip
over one of the letters.

00:12:31.132 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it's a
yes, they tip it over.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:90%
If it's a no, they tip it over.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Exactly.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that happens?

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.023 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: It does happen.

00:12:37.023 --> 00:12:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's interesting,
fascinating indeed.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, can anybody do their
own type of investigation?

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Or do they have to
be a Ross Allison?

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: No, anybody
can be a ghost hunter.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.390 align:middle line:84%
I definitely am
fascinated with the fact

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:84%
that ghost hunting is
so popular nowadays.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.110 align:middle line:90%
It's big-time.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:56.027 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah, when I
started ghost hunting,

00:12:56.027 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:84%
we were pretty much
still in the closet,

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
but now you tell people
you're a ghost hunter

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and they consider
you a rock star.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But it is one of
the things that--

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that
it is more accepted.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more people
in the field doing this.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.245 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
to be very cautious

00:13:12.245 --> 00:13:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that there's not a lot of
training going into this.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
mistakes being made.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I really am
out there trying

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
to encourage people to
get the training needed.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Because yeah, you
can ghost hunt,

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.460 align:middle line:84%
but don't get
involved with clients.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have some
tools of the trade

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
that you bring on some
of these ghost hunts.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.307 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about these things.

00:13:32.307 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Now, definitely
one of the things

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I always want to
encourage people is video.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Video is always going to be one
of the most important things

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle line:84%
you can do during
an investigation.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.782 align:middle line:90%
Photos are too limited.

00:13:42.782 --> 00:13:44.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't give you
a lot of information.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can I hold that?

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: You sure can.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:90%
This is a 4K camera.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So you always want to
record in the highest

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:90%
quality as possible.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Especially when you
do get evidence,

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
you want to go back and
review it as much as possible.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So I always encourage people to
get high-quality video cameras.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the things, too, so you
aren't always in a situation

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:84%
where you're missing
out on the opportunity--

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.150 align:middle line:84%
because you always see
those on the shows,

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.733 align:middle line:84%
where, oh, I saw
something over there,

00:14:10.733 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
but the cameras were
never aimed at that area.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.925 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: So we always
encourage our members

00:14:14.925 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:90%
to use body cams.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like police officers.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Exactly.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So at least it may be pointed
in the right direction when

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:90%
you have that experience.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: So body cams
are very important.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it's a backup.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: It is, definitely.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.653 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, look.

00:14:27.653 --> 00:14:29.278 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And that
could have been me.

00:14:29.278 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I was setting
things on the table.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So that shows you
the sensitivity

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.097 align:middle line:84%
that just a slight
vibration can set them off.

00:14:37.097 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other tools do
you have here that you use?

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.138 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well,
another fun little thing

00:14:41.138 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:90%
is a motion sensor.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So this actually can
pick up different things

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:90%
from heat or even light.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And it'll go off
like a little alarm.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So it just tells you that
something moved in the area.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we also
have EMF detectors,

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:84%
as you can see, when I get close
to those, how those go off.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So those are simple devices
kind of like the balls.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:84%
You can send them
down a hallway,

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and you'll actually see that
these will pick up something

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:90%
as something passes by them.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do these
tell you if they go on?

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.603 align:middle line:90%
What do you conclude?

00:15:14.603 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: It tells us
that there is something

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:90%
happening in the environment.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.680 align:middle line:84%
There is possibly EMF
readings, especially when

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:90%
you look at devices like this.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:84%
There is some sort of
vibration, some sort of motion

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:90%
is going on.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And those are some of the
things that we're looking for.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately, there's no
such thing as a ghost meter.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's no meter you
can set up in your house

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
and say, tell me
if there's a ghost.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But what we do as ghost
hunters as we collect

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.238 align:middle line:84%
as many devices that help us
read the environment and let us

00:15:45.238 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
know if there's changes
in the environment,

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:90%
changes we can't explain.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How sensitive
is this equipment?

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.065 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Some of this
is pretty sensitive.

00:15:54.065 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Like the balls, as you've
seen, just playing around

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
with things on the
table, will go off.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.070 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, when I
reach close, those go off.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
But you definitely want the
more sensitive equipment,

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:84%
but then you're looking
at bigger prices too.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you would
basically walk around,

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.172 align:middle line:84%
wherever you are,
with the equipment,

00:16:11.172 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:84%
waiting for a
reading or something?

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Some of it,
you'll walk around.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Some of it, you'll just
set down and produce

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.507 align:middle line:90%
a controlled experiment.

00:16:17.507 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
not gotten a reading?

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it disappointing?

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: It's
disappointing, but you

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.385 align:middle line:84%
have to understand,
with ghost hunting,

00:16:24.385 --> 00:16:26.983 align:middle line:84%
it's all about being at the
right place at the right time.

00:16:26.983 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you're building
your own equipment now,

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: We are.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.367 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that.

00:16:31.367 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I have teamed
up with Chad Goodwin,

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and we have actually
putting together

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:84%
a system in our new docuseries
that we're working on,

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:90%
called Parasense.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're the first to
actually try to document touch.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:84%
When people are being
touched by something,

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
scratched, pushed, we want to
see if we can validate that.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we're also the first
to produce equipment that

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:90%
helps us track the phenomena.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
As devices like
this will tell you,

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:84%
you could see something
move, but it really

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.320 align:middle line:90%
doesn't give you the data.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And data logging
is so important.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:05.869 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have to have that.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Exactly.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.763 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to be
scientific in your research,

00:17:08.763 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:84%
you have to have
that information.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So we've actually put
together a SPECTRE system,

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.228 align:middle line:84%
which stands for Special
Paranormal Environmental

00:17:15.228 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Computer Tracking
Research Equipment.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that what that is?

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: That is it.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:90%
That's one of them.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is we monitor
an environment, especially

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
the environment
around a subject.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:84%
We'll set up four
of them around them.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually see when
something comes towards them

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.135 align:middle line:90%
and moves away.

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.812 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's very fascinating.

00:17:34.812 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:84%
What can a novice expect
with equipment like this?

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, it's going
to be a lot more scientific.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people aren't
always looking for the numbers.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I think, right now, most people
are trained by the television

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.445 align:middle line:90%
shows to look for--

00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There we go again.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: --things like that.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:84%
You look for the excitement
of the instant gratification.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
ghost hunting has become,

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:90%
most days, for people.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
They want that
instant gratification

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:90%
when they go on a ghost hunt.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And the real
research is all about

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:84%
going over the hours and hours
of data and video and audio.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you can actually

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.730 align:middle line:84%
have a better understanding
of what is truly happening

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.032 align:middle line:90%
in our paranormal world.

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ross, how will you
use this equipment you're

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.310 align:middle line:90%
developing with the scientist?

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, we're
hoping to open people's minds

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:84%
to have a better understanding
of what's going on out there?

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.703 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you going
to mass produce them?

00:18:31.703 --> 00:18:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: We are
talking about it, yes.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the novice can
purchase it and start testing.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yes,
if they definitely

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:84%
want to go to that scale, we
definitely want it out there.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.095 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able to
collect as much data

00:18:45.095 --> 00:18:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and have a better understanding
of what's going on.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.960 align:middle line:84%
As I said, it's all about
being in the right place

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.070 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So I can get it out
there as much as I can,

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:84%
but if we have multiple
teams using it as well,

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that's going to give us all a
much better understanding when

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:84%
we start to collect
the data that we need.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How expensive is
it to get involved in this?

00:19:04.295 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well,
for some people,

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.320 align:middle line:90%
it could be pretty inexpensive.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:84%
You'd probably spend about $200
or $300 just to get started.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not bad.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.073 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: But for me,
we're looking at, you know,

00:19:13.073 --> 00:19:13.873 align:middle line:90%
probably--

00:19:13.873 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
in the thousands.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah,
$30,000, $40,000.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
lot of equipment.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: It is.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:84%
It is a lot of equipment,
but I'm very serious.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I really want to know
what's going on out there.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of strange encounters

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:90%
have ghost hunters encountered?

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.772 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Oh, gosh, you name
it, pretty much it's happened.

00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about you?

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Like I said-- for
me, I would say I've had a lot

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.698 align:middle line:84%
of physical encounters,
but the one thing--

00:19:39.698 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll be honest with you--

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I have yet to experience
is an apparition.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I have not
seen an apparition.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you want to?

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: I do.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do have a funny
story where I actually

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
think I might have seen it
where I was investigating

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
an old brothel and I had one
of my subjects up in the room

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.713 align:middle line:84%
where the spirits of the ladies
still get a little active.

00:20:02.713 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I had him
staying up in the room.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Now, he didn't want to do it.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.317 align:middle line:90%
He was, like, really--

00:20:06.317 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
uptight about that.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
He was like, do I have
to spend the night?

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, yes, I need
you to spend the night.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:90%
I got cameras on you.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not sure I'd
want to do that either.

00:20:14.295 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: [LAUGHS] So I
got cameras on the guy.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:10%
Everything's all set up for
this controlled experiment.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm sleeping downstairs.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just in this
room, sleeping on a couch.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And I can't sleep because
things are going on

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:84%
throughout the night,
just keeps waking me.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
feel it, right?

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: I could.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:90%
I could.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, it gets to be about 4
or 5 o'clock in the morning,

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and I hear him coming
down the stairs.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And my room actually
has a window in it,

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:90%
so I can see into the hallway.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
ignore him because I

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:84%
know he's going to come
to me and tell me he

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:90%
wants to go sleep in his car.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to stay
focused on my camera,

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:90%
going through the photos.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And I see, through
peripheral vision,

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.240 align:middle line:84%
somebody walk right
past that window

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and go down the next flight
of stairs to the first floor.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe you
did see an apparition.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And that's the thing,
is I went to go check on him

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.092 align:middle line:90%
and he was still up in the bed.

00:21:05.092 --> 00:21:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It wasn't him.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: It wasn't him.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who could it have been?

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And that's the
one time when I just--

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I could have looked and
saw a full-on apparition,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:90%
and I just thought it was him.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about people
who wake up in their bedroom

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.400 align:middle line:84%
thinking they see an object
or a person in their bedroom

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:90%
and then it's gone?

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:90%
What are they seeing?

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, there's a lot
of different things to that.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.715 align:middle line:84%
There is that common
phenomenon where

00:21:30.715 --> 00:21:32.590 align:middle line:84%
people have had those
experiences, especially

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.310 align:middle line:90%
when loved ones have passed.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:84%
That is a very common
experience where

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:84%
they'll see the
apparition of their loved

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:84%
one right at the moment
that they had died,

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and they'll appear at
the foot of their bed.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
also the fact that,

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:84%
if you want to bring
the science into it,

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:84%
you do have to be the
devil's advocate and say, OK,

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:90%
was it just lack of sleep?

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Are they still dreaming?

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we try
to bring some validation

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:90%
to those types of experiences.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ross, does the ghost
have to have died, as a human,

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:90%
at that spot to haunt it?

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: No.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of stories,
especially Abraham Lincoln

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.900 align:middle line:84%
has a very famous
case where he's

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.330 align:middle line:84%
been seen haunting
the White House,

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:84%
he's been seen haunting
the theater where

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:84%
he was assassinated,
he's even been

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:84%
seen in the house
across the street

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.095 align:middle line:84%
where he was taken
after he was shot.

00:22:21.095 --> 00:22:21.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:21.895 --> 00:22:23.312 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And
there's even places

00:22:23.312 --> 00:22:26.290 align:middle line:84%
where he's been seen where the
dress that Mary was wearing

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:84%
when he was assassinated
and has his blood on it,

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:90%
he'll be seen around that dress.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't he also have
a dream of his body lying

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.840 align:middle line:90%
in state at the White House?

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yes.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's
one of the theories

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that he very well could
have been psychic,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.620 align:middle line:84%
that he had a dream
about his assassination

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:90%
before it happened.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, tell me
about the Dominion tugboat.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.480 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Oh, the Dominion,
it is an old Navy tugboat.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
last wooden tugboats

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.700 align:middle line:84%
before they moved on
to the steel boats.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And we actually have had the
opportunity to investigate it.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.704 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:22:59.704 --> 00:23:03.496 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:03.496 --> 00:23:07.770 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: So we are on
the Dominion tugboat.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:10%
And this actually started
out as an old Navy tugboat.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the
last wooden boats

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.870 align:middle line:10%
before they moved on
to the steel boats.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:10%
There's been a sighting of
an apparition of a gentleman.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:10%
He's been seen in the overalls.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.830 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, one of
the owners, Dave,

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:31.680 align:middle line:10%
he had an experience
where he was down below

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:10%
and he felt something
go right through him.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:10%
And as it went
through him, the image

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:10%
of the backside of a
gentleman in overalls

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:10%
just walked right through
him and through the area

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:10%
and faded away.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.540 align:middle line:10%
So this is the location where
the apparition was experienced,

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:10%
where Dave felt something
come up behind him

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:10%
and then, all of a sudden,
the apparition of the back end

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:10%
of a gentleman appeared,
walking away from him,

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:10%
and then just faded away.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.700 align:middle line:10%
I know tools have been
moved around here as well,

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:10%
strange noises are heard.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:10%
So we'll see what we get.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.657 align:middle line:10%
If there's anybody
down here with us,

00:24:14.657 --> 00:24:15.615 align:middle line:10%
can you give us a sign?

00:24:15.615 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:10%


00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Wally, are you here?

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:10%
Hey, Wally, are you here?

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:10%
I got wrenches and tattoos,
and I'm also a mechanic.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.660 align:middle line:10%


00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.315 align:middle line:10%
Want to come talk
about this giant engine

00:24:34.315 --> 00:24:35.115 align:middle line:10%
that we're next to?

00:24:35.115 --> 00:24:39.995 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.995 --> 00:24:41.370 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: We're
definitely going

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.287 align:middle line:10%
to pick up a couple of
different temperatures.

00:24:43.287 --> 00:24:45.360 align:middle line:10%
It's very cool coming
down this hall.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.125 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:10%
The boat started moving
quite a bit more.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:50.430 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:50.730 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: I know.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:51.720 align:middle line:10%
>> I was just noticing.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.578 align:middle line:10%
I was like, what was that?

00:24:53.578 --> 00:24:54.870 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: What was that noise?

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:10%
Did you hear that?

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to switch
to infrared night shot

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.112 align:middle line:10%
so I can see down there.

00:25:02.112 --> 00:25:03.570 align:middle line:10%
[ALARM SOUNDING]

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:04.542 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh oh.

00:25:04.542 --> 00:25:08.277 align:middle line:90%


00:25:08.277 --> 00:25:09.610 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, there's nobody down there.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.226 align:middle line:10%
There's not.

00:25:11.226 --> 00:25:14.004 align:middle line:10%
[ALARM STOPS, THEN BEGINS AGAIN]

00:25:14.004 --> 00:25:15.856 align:middle line:10%
Twice.

00:25:15.856 --> 00:25:18.160 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: Did you scare
yourself hearing the alarm

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:10%
go off?

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.002 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.002 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't keep
us in suspense, Ross.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Did the ghost,
Wally, ever show up?

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, the odd thing
was is the motion sensor,

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.770 align:middle line:84%
this one right here, went
off two times right in a row.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.480 align:middle line:90%
And we can't explain.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It wasn't picking
up you or your friend.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: No, it was aimed down
a hallway no one had access to.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they had
the floor opened up

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
so you can't walk on that
section of the hallway

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.570 align:middle line:84%
because you'd fall
through to the next level.

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So something passed through
there and set that off.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Wally
die on that tugboat?

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: No, he did not, but
he did work quite a bit on it

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:84%
when he worked for
the Foss company.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would an
individual, a spirit,

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:84%
want to haunt a place
that it worked at?

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, there's
attachment to a person, place,

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.670 align:middle line:90%
or thing.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, sometimes, these
individuals, these spirits,

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:16.990 align:middle line:84%
are attracted to locations
where they just loved it there.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.852 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they spent a
lot of their free time

00:26:18.852 --> 00:26:21.310 align:middle line:84%
there, because it wasn't always
work for Wally, sometimes--

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they jovial?

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: --he
just volunteered.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they jovial, happy?

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.572 align:middle line:90%
In some cases, yeah.

00:26:27.572 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you've seen
happy ghosts as opposed

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:90%
to negative entities as well.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: In fact, it's
mostly neutral or happy.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:39.447 align:middle line:84%
It's more rare that you'll find
some very negative energies.

00:26:39.447 --> 00:26:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a troublesome ghost.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Or a
troublesome ghost.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.157 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
now, what are they?

00:26:43.157 --> 00:26:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well,
and sometimes people

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.520 align:middle line:84%
misunderstand when
they are dealing

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.050 align:middle line:90%
with paranormal phenomena.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.320 align:middle line:90%
We are taught to be afraid--

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.368 align:middle line:84%
through media, through a lot
of the movies that we watch.

00:26:55.368 --> 00:26:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through parents.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.537 align:middle line:84%
So you think that
they're out to get you.

00:26:58.537 --> 00:27:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, they're just
trying to get your attention,

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.620 align:middle line:90%
to say, hey, I'm here.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Acknowledge that I'm here.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.697 align:middle line:84%
And I find that, a lot of times,
once you acknowledge it and try

00:27:07.697 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
to communicate and have a
better understanding of what's

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.977 align:middle line:84%
going on, they may
just have a message

00:27:11.977 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:90%
that they want to pass on.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And once you get that message,
the activity completely stops.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you control the
activity of a ghost, Ross?

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I think, in
some cases, it's possible.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I think, when you open
yourself up to the fact

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.300 align:middle line:84%
that you want to communicate
with whatever's there,

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:84%
to have a better
understanding, I've

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:34.185 align:middle line:84%
had clients set
up rules that say,

00:27:34.185 --> 00:27:35.560 align:middle line:84%
if you're going
to be active, you

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:84%
can be active
around these times,

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:84%
especially when they're at
work, the place is yours.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:40.660 align:middle line:90%
Do whatever you want.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
actually listen?

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I think
in those cases.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.815 align:middle line:84%
Because they said, a lot
of times, when they set up

00:27:45.815 --> 00:27:48.610 align:middle line:84%
those rules and this
agreement on how they want

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to live with the spirits,
things have actually

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:90%
quieted down quite a bit.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the difference
between a spirit that we've

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.870 align:middle line:84%
been talking about
and something demonic?

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, when you
get into demonic energy

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:84%
or labeling demonic
energy, you're

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:84%
basically relying on
the religious belief.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.767 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there are very
negative energies out there.

00:28:13.767 --> 00:28:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Especially--

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No question about that.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.383 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah, because
we know that people

00:28:18.383 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
can do horrible things
to other people.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
energy can easily

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.360 align:middle line:84%
be passed on to the
spirit world as well.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: But I don't like
to label things demonic, just

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.740 align:middle line:84%
because it's negative,
because when you use the term,

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.410 align:middle line:84%
demonic, then you're bringing
religion into your research.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.327 align:middle line:84%
And if you're really
trying to be scientific--

00:28:35.327 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what
would you call it?

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.537 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I would just
say a negative energy.

00:28:38.537 --> 00:28:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about evil?

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.605 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I don't like to
use the term, evil, either.

00:28:42.605 --> 00:28:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But there is evil.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.272 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I definitely
think-- yeah,

00:28:45.272 --> 00:28:47.210 align:middle line:84%
you could definitely
experience a lot of that,

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:49.220 align:middle line:90%
but I think a lot of it is--

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I really want to be
unbiased in my research.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I really want to
be more scientific.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.838 align:middle line:84%
And when you go that
route, you really

00:28:58.838 --> 00:29:00.380 align:middle line:84%
have to go with what
you know and not

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.540 align:middle line:84%
with what you think
you know, or your bias,

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.770 align:middle line:90%
or your religious beliefs.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or back off on terms
and stuff like that too.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:90%
You can't label everything.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And I know, in this field,
there's a lot of labels

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.700 align:middle line:90%
that people like to use.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you're really trying
to bring new science into this,

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:84%
you just have to
go with the basics.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.737 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you communicate
with the spirit world often?

00:29:20.737 --> 00:29:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Oh gosh, yes,
I'm pretty much out there

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:90%
almost every weekend.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.952 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you get a response?

00:29:24.952 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: No.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:28.910 align:middle line:84%
One out of 10 cases usually can
provide some sort of evidence

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.692 align:middle line:84%
that there could be
something paranormal.

00:29:30.692 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, it's all about
being at the right place

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.700 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But do you think the
spirit is picking up on things

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:40.340 align:middle line:84%
you say even though they
may not be responding to it?

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I think, in a lot
of cases, it is very possible.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But then, when you're
investigating the paranormal,

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:84%
you do have to
determine, are you

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:84%
dealing with something that's
intelligent or are you dealing

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:90%
with something residual?

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.717 align:middle line:84%
And if you're dealing
with something residual,

00:29:54.717 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
respond to you.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to acknowledge
that you're there.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:01.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just its own little
memory, playing itself

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:90%
out over and over again.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In its
own little world.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Exactly.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know our
friend Joshua P. Warren.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yes.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's a great
paranormalist and investigator.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.078 align:middle line:84%
He's got his own views on how
to communicate with spirits.

00:30:13.078 --> 00:30:15.620 align:middle line:10%
>>JOSHUA WARREN: I think that
there are beings around us that

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:18.440 align:middle line:10%
would love to just show up and
have a conversation with us,

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.480 align:middle line:10%
but that's no easier
for them to do

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.530 align:middle line:10%
than it is for us to do that.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:10%
So there's another way to
communicate with these beings

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.020 align:middle line:10%
that is usually more effective.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:31.520 align:middle line:10%
And it deals with shaping
your daily experience

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:10%
through synchronicity.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:10%
In other words, let's
say you get up one day

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:10%
and you say, to your deceased
grandmother, grandmother,

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:41.780 align:middle line:10%
I would love to have an
interaction with you today,

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.650 align:middle line:10%
and you put that out there,
and then you go about your day.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you'll walk
past a window, you'll

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.310 align:middle line:10%
see some flowers in
the window of a shop,

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.870 align:middle line:10%
and it's her favorite flowers.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.420 align:middle line:10%
And then you walk into the
shop, and there's a book there,

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.055 align:middle line:10%
and that book has some-- and
there are signs and symbols--

00:30:56.055 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or you smell her
perfume or something like that.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.570 align:middle line:10%
>>WARREN: This is
how you usually

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.620 align:middle line:10%
are able to tap into that
information of the spirit

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:10%
realm, because cosmologists
and astrophysicists tell us

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.550 align:middle line:10%
that there is no such thing
as past, present, and future.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:10%
It's all happening at once.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.470 align:middle line:10%
We're sort of moving through it.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:17.457 align:middle line:10%
So your grandmother is still
alive somewhere in this plane.

00:31:17.457 --> 00:31:18.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.450 align:middle line:10%
>>WARREN: And you
have to open your mind

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.600 align:middle line:10%
in terms of how
that communication

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.540 align:middle line:10%
forum is going to emerge.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.990 align:middle line:10%
And if you do that,
you will be led

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:34.100 align:middle line:10%
onto a path that gives
you profound communication

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:38.100 align:middle line:10%
with certain entities and
even the universe itself.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Ross, how do you
communicate with the spirit

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.090 align:middle line:90%
world on your own?

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well, like I said,
for me, it's all about trying

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.180 align:middle line:90%
to validate these encounters.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe intent
is very important.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you echo
what Josh just said?

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: I like to believe.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a big part
of me that is very

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.920 align:middle line:84%
fascinated with a lot of this,
a lot of the theories and ideas

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think, yes, I'd like
to believe it's all possible.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So for me, my quest is,
can I validate that?

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Can I prove that
to other people?

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything we
can do, through science,

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.530 align:middle line:84%
through the equipment,
that we can bring forth--?

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:20.197 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Through
things like this, yeah.

00:32:20.197 --> 00:32:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: --and make your
beliefs more valuable.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you back
up this information?

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.063 align:middle line:90%
Do you jot things down?

00:32:27.063 --> 00:32:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a journal?

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:28.280 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.947 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Journaling
is very important.

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Journaling is one
of the ways that we

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.895 align:middle line:84%
can determine if there's
a pattern to activity.

00:32:33.895 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
would that work?

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well,
just writing down

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.350 align:middle line:84%
the dates, times what's
happening, is really important.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And also your emotional
status at the time.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yours?

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Your own personal--

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The investigators.

00:32:49.025 --> 00:32:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yes, even the
clients at the times,

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.680 align:middle line:84%
because you find, a lot
of times, that sometimes,

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:84%
when you're going through
a stressful situation,

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.577 align:middle line:84%
you may be triggering
the phenomenon yourself.

00:32:59.577 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
understand that.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there is
a big theory that we

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.687 align:middle line:84%
are producing the phenomena
and aren't aware of it.

00:33:05.687 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
conceivable, isn't it?

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Exactly.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So if we can journal
our experiences,

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.200 align:middle line:84%
this will help us to have a
better understanding of what's

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.448 align:middle line:90%
going on out there.

00:33:16.448 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Another thing with
journaling that we

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.870 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to
understand is the mind

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:24.330 align:middle line:84%
tends to forget information
after three minutes.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:90%
So if you're--

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That fast.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not
journaling right away

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.710 align:middle line:84%
after your experiences, you
could lose a lot of details.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you go back
and look at it and go,

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.130 align:middle line:90%
oh my God, I did this?

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:34.950 align:middle line:90%
I did that?

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.900 align:middle line:84%
But I also find that journaling
is very important to the fact

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:44.360 align:middle line:84%
that people learn to tell their
experiences better because they

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.780 align:middle line:90%
want it to be believable.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.780 align:middle line:84%
They don't want you to
think that they're crazy.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.160 align:middle line:90%
I had this experience.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.020 align:middle line:90%
I want you to believe it.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so,
you learn to tell

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:90%
that story better and better.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And so you're not intentionally
trying to lie or manipulate

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.050 align:middle line:84%
the situation, but
there's a lot of details

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:04.170 align:middle line:90%
that can be forgotten.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And so are
not even forgotten,

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.429 align:middle line:84%
but can be twisted in
telling that story better.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So by having that true raw data
in your journal will help us,

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:84%
as paranormal
investigators, understand

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:19.969 align:middle line:90%
our client's experience.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:23.317 align:middle line:84%
It also helps us to try to
debunk the experience as

00:34:23.317 --> 00:34:25.400 align:middle line:84%
well because that's one
of the first things you've

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.659 align:middle line:90%
got to try and do first.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:29.630 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to also label
everything as paranormal.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I have known
you to be a straight shooter.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Has there ever been a case
that was so emotional for you

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.060 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't take it?

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.929 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: There was a situation
as a case in Washington,

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:48.840 align:middle line:84%
where a grandmother had
shot and killed her family.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:50.909 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah,
it was a big case.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Horrible.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: And what happened--

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.491 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people did she kill?

00:34:54.491 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: If I
remember correctly,

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.530 align:middle line:90%
I think four or five people.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:02.380 align:middle line:84%
This is, gosh, about 12 years
ago, maybe more than that.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, the case got
a lot of media attention.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And during that time,
shortly after this happened,

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:15.280 align:middle line:84%
the family contacted us and
wanted us to investigate.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, for me, this was
while the family's still

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:20.140 align:middle line:90%
in the grieving process.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I've had people contact me
right away after somebody dies,

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and I feel the
individuals need time

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.190 align:middle line:84%
to grieve first before
you have people come out

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.720 align:middle line:90%
and investigate because--

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would seem to
be unhealthy if you don't.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Right, exactly.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:39.937 align:middle line:84%
And so they told
me that the reason

00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:41.520 align:middle line:84%
why their grandmother
did this is they

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.040 align:middle line:84%
felt that she might
have been possessed.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And so they said, if you
want to have this opportunity

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.080 align:middle line:84%
to investigate this,
you better do it now

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.360 align:middle line:84%
because we're
cleaning up the house

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to put
it back on the market.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would
want to buy it?

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Well,
that's the thing.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.330 align:middle line:90%
It was a rental.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you have to
disclose that, don't you?

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.525 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: It was a rental.

00:35:59.525 --> 00:36:00.500 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And in lot of cases, you
don't always have to say that.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.350 align:middle line:84%
But for me, as a
paranormal investigator,

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:10.520 align:middle line:84%
I was really hesitant
to do it, but I also

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.490 align:middle line:84%
saw this very small
window of opportunity.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:17.602 align:middle line:84%
If you want to collect the
data to validate this case,

00:36:17.602 --> 00:36:18.560 align:middle line:90%
get in there and do it.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you buy
a house that murders

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.428 align:middle line:90%
had been done in it?

00:36:23.428 --> 00:36:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: I don't know if I'd
personally want to live in it.

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm always-- I don't want to
take my work home with me,

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.340 align:middle line:84%
but I definitely would
investigate a place like that.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it was going
cheap, would you buy it?

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.017 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah,
that probably makes

00:36:36.017 --> 00:36:37.100 align:middle line:90%
it a little more tempting.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:38.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:36:38.365 --> 00:36:40.160 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you, Ross?

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Next
is we are actually

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.760 align:middle line:90%
doing a docuseries, Parasense.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And we're really
trying to bring forth

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:50.280 align:middle line:90%
the science, the research.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
fascinating part is

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:56.960 align:middle line:84%
we're doing a whole
new part of research

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.400 align:middle line:90%
where touch is involved.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think we want to see
if we can validate that.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What freaks me out
are little spirits of children.

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:06.770 align:middle line:90%
It's very sad to me.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: It is sad.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
come across that?

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of my
favorite stories

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I wrote in "Haunted Toys"
was about a little girl

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:16.850 align:middle line:90%
that haunts.

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And she was attached
to a baby lamb.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:21.380 align:middle line:90%
She had a little stuffed lamb.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's cute.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.535 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And she'd carry it
around with her everywhere.

00:37:24.535 --> 00:37:26.120 align:middle line:90%
This is another case where--

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.620 align:middle line:90%
very obsessed with it.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And she was actually
holding that lamb

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.520 align:middle line:90%
when she was struck by a car.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: (SYMPATHETICALLY) Oh.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And the
story was that, when

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:84%
she was hit by the car,
her lamb went flying

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.465 align:middle line:90%
and no one was able to find it.

00:37:39.465 --> 00:37:40.265 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:37:40.265 --> 00:37:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Off in the
woods or wherever.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Right.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.890 align:middle line:84%
The mother really wanted to try
and have her daughter buried

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:48.290 align:middle line:84%
with it because she knew how
much she loved that lamb.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a horrible story.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And she searched
all over the streets

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.070 align:middle line:90%
and couldn't find it anywhere.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, they ended up burying
her without the lamb.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But when she got home
after the funeral,

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.475 align:middle line:84%
the lamb was sitting
on their porch.

00:37:58.475 --> 00:38:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did it get there?

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Don't know.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.250 align:middle line:84%
No one ever claimed
to bringing it to her.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But after she brought the lamb
home and put it in the house,

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.030 align:middle line:84%
things started happening
around that lamb.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.280 align:middle line:84%
She'd wake up in the morning
and find the lamb sitting

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.070 align:middle line:84%
in front of the TV, on Saturday
mornings, where the little girl

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.112 align:middle line:90%
used to love to watch TV.

00:38:17.112 --> 00:38:19.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think the
little spirit of the girl

00:38:19.112 --> 00:38:20.240 align:middle line:90%
would move the lamb around?

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Oh yeah.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she ended up
contacting a ghost hunter

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.710 align:middle line:90%
to come in and investigate.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And when they did an EVP session
with the lamb sitting next

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.810 align:middle line:90%
to it, they picked up crying.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.102 align:middle line:90%
And it was interesting--

00:38:31.102 --> 00:38:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Crying sounds?

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: Yeah, sounds
of the little girl crying.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
picked up the lamb,

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:39.490 align:middle line:84%
they even said the lamb
felt a little moist.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, that night--

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From tears.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ALLISON: Yeah.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.420 align:middle line:84%
That night, as
always, the mother

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.430 align:middle line:84%
puts the lamb in
her daughter's bed.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And the mother just
could not sleep.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:48.820 align:middle line:10%
She was very restless.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:52.452 align:middle line:84%
And when she went to go
check in her daughter's room,

00:38:52.452 --> 00:38:54.160 align:middle line:84%
she saw the lamb there,
and she curled up

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.650 align:middle line:84%
on her daughter's bed, and she
was just crying and holding

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.180 align:middle line:84%
that lamb, and she looked
over in the doorway

00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and she saw her daughter
for the first time.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And then her
daughter just faded.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's compelling.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLISON: And she never
saw her daughter since.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And she thinks why her
daughter was crying in

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.500 align:middle line:84%
that recording is her
daughter was saying goodbye.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ross, how do
people get a hold of you?

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:10%
>>ALLISON: I always encourage
people to find me on Facebook,

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.130 align:middle line:10%

great ghost hunter.

00:39:25.942 --> 00:39:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's an incredible
ability to go out

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.910 align:middle line:84%
in the field with equipment
and hunt for ghosts

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and actually find them.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.380 align:middle line:84%
