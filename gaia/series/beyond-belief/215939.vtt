00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: We've got
an amazing Beyond Belief

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.170 align:middle line:90%
program for you.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.250 align:middle line:10%
Karen Bell is with us, a
clairvoyant and spiritual medium

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:10%
and trance channeler
from Ontario, Canada.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:10%
She channels Sarai, an
Andromedan collective,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.660 align:middle line:10%
helping others,
releasing limited beliefs

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.710 align:middle line:10%
and aligning them
with source energy.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Karen, welcome to the program.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KAREN BELL: Thank you so
much for having me, George.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure to
be here with you.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: I've been really well.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm enjoying Boulder.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
I've never been to
Boulder before, so--

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great area.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Yeah, it's
been a really fun trip.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How are
things in Canada?

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Cold, but
starting to warm up.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.915 align:middle line:90%
Spring is coming.

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are from Toronto,
and now you moved to London?

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Yes.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.996 align:middle line:84%
Originally I grew up
just outside of Toronto.

00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
this gift you have.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: I'm very
intuitive, I guess.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:10%
You could say I'm a clairvoyant.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:10%
I'm a channeler.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm a medium.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:10%
And so this all
began, actually, when

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:10%
I did live closer to Toronto.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:10%
I was working as a makeup
artist at the time.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:10%
And I started to have these
intuitive insights when

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:10%
I was doing makeup on people.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.800 align:middle line:10%
I started having these
awarenesses and downloads

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:10%
about them.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:90%
That was about 20 years ago.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.886 align:middle line:90%
That's how it all started.

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when
you were early,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
a little kid, you started
picking up on energies,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:90%
didn't you?

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: I did.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I had many different
experiences when

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
I was a kid, that I know now
were psychic experiences.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that at the
time because I had no one

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:90%
to really explain it to me.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I had no reference point for it.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.022 align:middle line:84%
But I did have many
different experiences.

00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most
prominent one was

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:84%
one when I was
about 12 years old,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and my dad had taken me
to the Toronto Air Show.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And this was something we
did every year together.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:90%
So it was an annual tradition.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great air show.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Yeah.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing air show.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And so we were sitting
watching the planes,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and I was for whatever
reason, feeling really anxious

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:90%
this particular time.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And I started to have
this inner vision of one

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:90%
of the planes crashing.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And what happened in
that air show actually

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.355 align:middle line:84%
is two of the planes
did end up colliding.

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: And crashing
into Lake Ontario.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
first, I guess, memory

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.027 align:middle line:84%
of a psychic experience I had
that I could verify as accurate.

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you tell
your father about this

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:90%
before it happened?

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.642 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: I didn't.

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say anything because,
again, I didn't really

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.282 align:middle line:90%
understand the experience.

00:02:39.282 --> 00:02:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand that it
was a psychic experience.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know what
to make of it afterwards.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I just looking
back when I learned

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
about gifts, such as
premonition and intuition,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:84%
then I realized that
that's what it was.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
But it took many,
many years for me

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.775 align:middle line:84%
to realize that that
experience was actually

00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:90%
a psychic experience.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how old were you?

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: I was about
12 at that time.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.055 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:02.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it scare you?

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.955 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: It did a
little bit because--

00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I was unsettled
because I thought

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.435 align:middle line:84%
the plane was going to crash
into the crowd for some reason.

00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And kill you.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So I had a lot of
anxiety around it.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards, I
really didn't know what

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:90%
to do with that information.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you're experiencing
something like premonition,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.548 align:middle line:84%
and obviously, if it's
a negative experience,

00:03:25.548 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
you're wondering,
was there something

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:84%
that could have been done,
or what was that all about?

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Karen, jump
ahead in your 20s,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.425 align:middle line:84%
you had channeling
experiences with clients.

00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:35.225 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:36.025 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Yes.

00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had psychic
experiences with clients.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So again, I started working
as a makeup artist in my 20s.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
a few years in was

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:84%
that when I was doing people's
makeup, I was close to them.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.140 align:middle line:90%
I was in their energy field.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And I would start to just
have these awarenesses.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.830 align:middle line:84%
I would know things about
them that I shouldn't know.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Or if they were
talking about someone

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:84%
who was dear to them, like a
loved one, their spouse or even

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:84%
a pet, sometimes I would have
these awarenesses of what

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
that person looked like,
or what they were doing,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
or their occupation, or
all these little tidbits

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
of information that
I shouldn't know.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You started offering
free readings, didn't you?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: I did that for a while.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So when I started having
these experiences,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
to make of it.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided,
first of all, that I

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.700 align:middle line:84%
would start reading and
researching about it.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So I started reading books
about clairvoyance and psychic

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.450 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And then after
that, what I did is

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I put out a free ad in
the classifieds that

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
was just an advertisement
for free psychic readings.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.982 align:middle line:84%
And this was just for
me to practice, yeah.

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Flooded with people.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: I did get flooded.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
But it was really
just a way for me

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.683 align:middle line:84%
to practice and see for
myself if this was real.

00:04:49.683 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So what I would
do is I would just

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:90%
take the person's first name.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:90%
We would speak on the phone.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually
really surprised

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:84%
to discover that
I could accurately

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
tune in and receive information
about people I didn't know.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.865 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
during church?

00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, with church,
what I realized is that

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.260 align:middle line:90%
there's a church--

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
a religion rather
called spiritualism,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
which is a sort
of a religion that

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
is affiliated with
mediumship, meaning

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
they believe in
mediumship and they

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:90%
have mediums at every service.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So I started going to
a spiritualist church

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:90%
just to help me develop.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:90%
But I was also--

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I had this experience
at another church,

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.960 align:middle line:84%
where I was aware of
someone's loved one.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So we went into
meditation in the middle

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:90%
of the church service.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And when we went
into meditation,

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.932 align:middle line:84%
I had this vision of this
woman in front of me.

00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
I knew this, but I

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:84%
knew that she was the mother
of the man sitting next to me.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I had all of this
information come in.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:84%
This was my first
mediumship experience.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I had all of this information
come in about her.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we came
out of meditation,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I decided, well, I have to
see if this is accurate.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I talked to
the man next to me.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
that everything

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:84%
that she gave me, all these
little tidbits of information

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:90%
were accurate.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.870 align:middle line:84%
About jewelry she had
and hobbies she had,

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:90%
all of these little details.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you consider
that a spiritual awakening?

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: It was part of
my spiritual awakening.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It was part of my
spiritual awakening.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I would say that I've had quite
a few different experiences that

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
have contributed to my
spiritual awakening, which

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:84%
is the realization that we are
more than these physical bodies,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
but certainly the
awareness that we don't die

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and that we can
communicate after death,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.695 align:middle line:84%
certainly that's been a huge
part of my spiritual awakening.

00:06:46.695 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some of the
telltale signs that you're

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:90%
having an awakening?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Oh, that's a
really good question.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's different for everybody.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.110 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the biggest
signs, or one of the biggest

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.658 align:middle line:84%
feelings about it, is a
sense sometimes of confusion,

00:07:03.658 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:84%
because we have to
remember that when we're

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:84%
going through any type of
spiritual awakening experience,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.410 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that happens
is our perception can shift.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So our perception
about ourselves,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
our perception about the world,
our perception about everything.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.843 align:middle line:84%
And that can be
really unsettling.

00:07:20.843 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that happens
with spiritual awakening,

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
too, is that the frequency of
our energy body starts to shift,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.200 align:middle line:90%
starts to change.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And how that translates
into our lived experience

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
is that we start to both
attract and be attracted

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
to very different people,
very different places, very

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.630 align:middle line:90%
different things.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So that too can
be very unsettling

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.370 align:middle line:84%
because it feels
like you're becoming

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.665 align:middle line:90%
a completely different person.

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Karen, how can you enhance
the spiritual awakening?

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: How can you enhance it?

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, for me, what
I've discovered

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.500 align:middle line:84%
is it's really this
process, especially lately,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
it's been this process of really
becoming the witness of what's

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:90%
going on in my mind.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:06.450 align:middle line:84%
My first sense or my first
spiritual awakening realization

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
was this sense of
I am not the body.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.165 align:middle line:84%
And then I had this realization,
well, I'm also not the mind.

00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So when we realize we're
not the mind, what happens

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
is we start to become the
observer of our thoughts,

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and we can be much more
discerning about the thoughts

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.360 align:middle line:90%
that we're holding.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the ways that we

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.140 align:middle line:84%
can support our spiritual
awakening is sitting in silence

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.565 align:middle line:84%
and being really aware of
what's going on in our mind.

00:08:28.565 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the difference
between a spiritual awakening

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.269 align:middle line:90%
and ascension?

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: OK.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So spiritual awakening I
think of as the process

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:84%
of realizing or
remembering who you truly

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:90%
are as a spiritual being.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And ascension, I think of as
the energetic result of that.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So as we awaken spiritually,
our energy body shifts.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of
this word, ascension,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.710 align:middle line:84%
you can even sense
this rising up.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So our energy body
starts to shift

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.490 align:middle line:90%
in the energy and the frequency.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.630 align:middle line:90%
It starts to elevate.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what ascension is.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the result of
spiritual awakening.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gosh, I'm learning
more about this from you

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.745 align:middle line:84%
in just these few moments than
I have in my whole lifetime.

00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:10.156 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Oh, that's amazing.

00:09:10.156 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Collective ascension.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is that?

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Collective ascension.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So collective ascension,
I would describe

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
as the global shift in our
collective consciousness.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So think of our
collective consciousness

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.740 align:middle line:84%
as this unified field of
all of our thought forms.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And the vibration of it really
reflects the dominant thought

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:90%
forms that most people have.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening now
is a shift in the energy

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:84%
or the frequency of our
collective consciousness.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.810 align:middle line:90%
We are being elevated.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:90%
We're being shifted.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
collective ascension

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:84%
is all of us rising together
and shifting together.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.667 align:middle line:84%
The result of
collective ascension

00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:48.125 align:middle line:84%
is a higher level
of consciousness.

00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is
that important now?

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Yeah, it's
so important now,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:84%
George, because I think it's a
path to our survival, actually.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of the dominant
level of consciousness that

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
has prevailed for
most of human history,

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
it's been this level
of consciousness

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:90%
based in separation.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:84%
The level of consciousness
of separation,

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I perceive that I'm separate
from you and Mother Earth,

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lack of
reverence for life.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of that, that
has caused a lot of destruction.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:84%
If we continue on that path,
we could perhaps self-destruct.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think ascension is the path
to healing, both individually

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:90%
and collectively.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You taught
yourself all this?

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Not really.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.252 align:middle line:84%
I have some help from my
guides and the guided channel.

00:10:37.252 --> 00:10:38.052 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:38.052 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll talk
about those guides later.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Yes.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarai,
one of the guides?

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: One of my guides.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Probably my most prominent
and important guide right now.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about Sarai.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Who is that?

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: So Sarai is
one of my guides,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and she's the being
that I channel.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And she identifies
herself as an ambassador

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:84%
for a collective consciousness
of beings from Andromeda.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And Sarai is also you can think
of her as a parallel incarnation

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.550 align:middle line:84%
of me, which we'll probably
talk about that in a few moments

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
But what a parallel
incarnation is, is it's

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
a simultaneous incarnation
that our soul is experiencing,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
or a portion of our soul or our
consciousness is experiencing.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, Sarai is
me in another dimension.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Although when I'm
channeling her,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.215 align:middle line:84%
I experience her as a separate
being, a separate entity.

00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
first come upon Sarai?

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: So it was
probably around 2018,

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and I started getting up
very early to meditate.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And so day after day, I would
get up 4 or 5 in the morning

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:90%
to meditate.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.225 align:middle line:90%
And one day, I started to--

00:11:45.225 --> 00:11:46.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:11:46.025 --> 00:11:46.875 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Why?

00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I was going through a
rough point at that time.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And so meditation
seemed like the answer.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I just kept getting
intuitively like,

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, just meditation
is the answer.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:90%
And to be honest, it was.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So I started getting up
so early to meditate.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was that
I started to sense this--

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
what looked to me like a blue
orb on my left hand side.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So this radiant
ball of blue light.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And every day I'd
get up and meditate,

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:90%
and that orb was there.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And for the longest
time, I didn't really

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.550 align:middle line:90%
have interactions with it.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.600 align:middle line:90%
It just was there.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:90%
And it felt loving and peaceful.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And over time,
George, I realized

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.310 align:middle line:90%
that this orb was a being.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And that she was starting
to communicate with me.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I started sitting
with a paper and a pen

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:84%
so that I could write down
all of these downloads

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:90%
that I was getting.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, that
progressed into verbally

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:90%
or vocally channeling her.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.485 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Sarai
came to you first?

00:12:45.485 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Yes.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think she's been
with me for a long time.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I think she'd been with
me for a long time.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't realize
it because there

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:84%
was this point in time when I
started making YouTube videos.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was into spirituality,
but I wasn't into channeling.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:90%
I didn't really understand that.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.450 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't channeling at the time.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:84%
But some of the information
that was coming through--

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:90%
so long ago, that was 2009--

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:84%
some of the information
coming through I

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:84%
recognize now as
being from Sarai.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is she
your guardian angel?

00:13:19.805 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: In a sense.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
I do have this sense that
these Andromedan beings are

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
like the angels of
Andromeda, so she

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.365 align:middle line:90%
does feel very angelic to me.

00:13:28.365 --> 00:13:29.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's she look like?

00:13:29.615 --> 00:13:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: She's beautiful.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I see her as this being
with huge blue eyes.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.980 align:middle line:90%
She has light hair.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And she has sort of a
bluish tinge to her skin.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if
her skin actually

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:84%
is blue, because my
sense is that she's

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:90%
more of a nonphysical being.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:84%
But she certainly has a
blue emanation of light.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at some pictures

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and just describe
what we're looking at.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Yes.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.552 align:middle line:84%
So these are some
pictures that--

00:14:02.552 --> 00:14:03.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great eyes.

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.652 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Yeah, beautiful eyes.

00:14:05.652 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
These are some pictures
that I created in an AI art

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:90%
generator called Midjourney.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I was trying to
really capture her eyes

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:17.000 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
stands out to me when

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.770 align:middle line:90%
I see her clairvoyantly.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:90%
So she often has two.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
This sort of looks
like a space jumpsuit,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of
cosmic uniform on,

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:84%
which is sort of a
royal blue in color.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:90%
It has a high collar.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, the big eyes
are really important.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:90%
And then the bluish tinge.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.736 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are those freckles?

00:14:39.736 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Yeah.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.730 align:middle line:90%
She does have little freckles.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.305 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that all of
these images are different.

00:14:45.305 --> 00:14:46.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She looks
like an avatar.

00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Yeah, she does
look like an avatar.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, she does.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.270 align:middle line:84%
But the shape of her face,
too, is really interesting

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:84%
because the eyes are the most
prominent part of her face.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And then her face is very
narrow at the bottom,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:90%
and she does appear--

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting because
she appears child-like.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But the wisdom and the
consciousness that comes through

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.160 align:middle line:84%
is very wise and almost
feels like an elder,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.132 align:middle line:84%
yet she appears to have
this child-like face.

00:15:19.132 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I asked you if
she might be a guardian angel,

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.435 align:middle line:84%
you were a little
hesitant about that.

00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, I do feel
that she's an angel.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it can be a
little bit confusing.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I do feel like she's
one of my guides.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And she does--
one of the reasons

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
that I feel that
she's angelic is

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:84%
because in the same way
that we think of our angels

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth in the sense
that they're nonphysical,

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I have a sense that Sarai
is also nonphysical,

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and yet I do see an image
that represents her.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does she
communicate with you?

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: She communicates
with me telepathically.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So telepathy is
mind-to-mind communication.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So I receive a sort
of instant download.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like airdrop
with our devices.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
When we transfer a file
from one to another,

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.270 align:middle line:84%
we have this sense of something
just appearing on the device.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what telepathy
feels like to me.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was she once
a human being, Karen?

00:16:15.615 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: I don't
think so, George.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't get the
sense that she was.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Although she
describes how because

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:84%
she and I are
connected, that she

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.867 align:middle line:84%
can have the human
experience through me,

00:16:26.867 --> 00:16:27.825 align:middle line:90%
through my incarnation.

00:16:27.825 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe you created her.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, I do think
she's an aspect of me.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I do think she's an
aspect of me, for sure.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:90%
What's her mission?

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.070 align:middle line:90%
What does she want?

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: So her mission and
the mission of this Andromedan

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.300 align:middle line:84%
collective is to assist
with the evolution

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.990 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So again, if you think of
our collective consciousness

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:84%
as this unified field
of energy, there's

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
this shift that's
seeking to happen.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And so she's trying to
help us with that shift

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.276 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness.

00:16:59.276 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is she doing her job?

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: I think she is.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:84%
She's certainly doing
her job with me,

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:84%
because I've changed a
lot in a positive way

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:90%
since I started channeling her.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.486 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
witness consciousness?

00:17:10.486 --> 00:17:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: So witness consciousness
is a state that we take on,

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:84%
when we start to
realize that who we are

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:90%
is more than this physical body.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So when we recognize
that who we are

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:84%
is a spiritual
being or a soul, we

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.349 align:middle line:84%
recognize that we are not this
body and we're not the mind,

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:29.360 align:middle line:84%
but rather we're
the witness of that.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So witness
consciousness is being

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.260 align:middle line:84%
able to step back a little
bit, and see yourself or see

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:84%
your human self from
a bit of a distance.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Like an avatar, so seeing your
human avatar from a distance.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you take that
witness consciousness,

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.910 align:middle line:84%
it's incredibly
healing because you

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.913 align:middle line:84%
get to examine your thoughts
and even your emotions, all

00:17:49.913 --> 00:17:51.580 align:middle line:84%
of these energies
you're carrying around

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and really decide if
they're serving you,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.050 align:middle line:84%
or if you want to
let go of them.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the star
cluster of Andromeda,

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.530 align:middle line:90%
is this where she comes from?

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, there's the
Andromedan constellation

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's the
Andromedan galaxy.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:12.102 align:middle line:84%
So she identifies herself as
being from the Andromeda galaxy.

00:18:12.102 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, now, tell
me more about that.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, the
Andromeda galaxy

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
is the closest
galaxy to our galaxy.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
know these things?

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: How do I
know these things?

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:84%
I've received so
much from Sarai,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and I consider myself to be
a student of Sarai as well.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Just as much as anyone
listening to the channeling,

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.605 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself to be a
student, so I take good notes.

00:18:35.605 --> 00:18:37.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
Sarai want with you?

00:18:37.555 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: What does
she want with me?

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think she
wants to support me

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.450 align:middle line:84%
in my awakening experience
and my ascension.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But I also have this
sense of devotion to--

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I guess you'd describe
it a devotion to humanity

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
where I want to assist
as well in this elevation

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness or this
evolution of consciousness.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.547 align:middle line:84%
So we're all in it
together, George.

00:19:01.547 --> 00:19:02.755 align:middle line:90%
We're all helping each other.

00:19:02.755 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is this
work so important, Karen?

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, again,
it's important

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:84%
because I think this level of
consciousness that most of us

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:84%
have been operating at
is destructive in nature.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:84%
When we don't sense
the interconnection

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
between ourselves or between
ourselves in the Earth,

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:84%
then we tend to make decisions
and take action from that place.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:90%
And it can be very destructive.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And so when we start to have
this realization that everything

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
is divine, and that
everything is interconnected,

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:84%
we make very different decisions
and we take different actions.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And those actions are more
conducive to supporting life

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:90%
and to revering life.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some of the
Sarai's teachings are what?

00:19:46.325 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, her
primary teachings

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:84%
are about what she would
call true identity.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
True identity, she
talks about that a lot.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's realizing
and recognizing

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that our true identity is pure
consciousness, pure awareness.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're not these physical
bodies, we're not our minds.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But this human construct
is a vessel and a vehicle

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.140 align:middle line:84%
for us to have a
human experience,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:90%
but it's not our identity.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:84%
The reason that's important
is because that distance

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.068 align:middle line:84%
is what enables us
to start to examine,

00:20:18.068 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:84%
again, the thought
forms that we're holding

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.318 align:middle line:84%
and the beliefs
we're were holding,

00:20:21.318 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and even the emotional
charges were holding.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And decide if we want to
keep carrying that around,

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
or if we want to
release it or heal it.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.046 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, does she
help us in our ascension?

00:20:30.046 --> 00:20:31.115 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: She does.

00:20:31.115 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your ascension.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Yeah.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.760 align:middle line:84%
She helps in all
of our ascension.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Because again, ascension
is this shift in energy

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.080 align:middle line:84%
that occurs when we start
dropping these thought forms

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.505 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of
it this way, George,

00:20:42.505 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
when we're born
into this reality,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:90%
we are these pure beings.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But over time, we start to take
on all of these thought forms,

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.210 align:middle line:84%
all of these beliefs,
all of this conditioning.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And some of it serves us,
but a lot of it doesn't.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
have an awakening,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:84%
we start to realize that we can
let go of those thought forms.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to be so
identified with them.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.440 align:middle line:84%
When we let go of them,
our energy shifts.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.147 align:middle line:90%
And again, that's ascension.

00:21:08.147 --> 00:21:09.855 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Sarai
is helping us with.

00:21:09.855 --> 00:21:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How incomplete would
your life be without Sarai?

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: I think it would
be really incomplete.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But before I started
channeling, I didn't even

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:90%
know what I was missing.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So I can say now that this is by
far the most fulfilling aspect

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:84%
of my life, is
connecting with Sarai

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.770 align:middle line:90%
and channeling her for others.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I have an incredible community
of people that I channel for

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and just that human
connection and being

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.520 align:middle line:84%
able to witness the
way that people shift

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:90%
as a result of these teachings.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.980 align:middle line:84%
It by far has been the
most fulfilling thing

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.105 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever experienced.

00:21:44.105 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say that
the messages from Sarai

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.516 align:middle line:90%
are for our benefit?

00:21:50.516 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: I would.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I've never had a negative
message from Sarai,

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.937 align:middle line:84%
or I've never had
the sense that--

00:21:55.937 --> 00:21:56.737 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A warning.

00:21:56.737 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: No.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:90%
I've never really had a warning.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:21:59.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:84%
She often just draws
our attention back

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:90%
to this present moment.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Because when I'm
channeling her for others,

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.030 align:middle line:84%
it's very common for them
to ask about future events.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting
when people ask that.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't give an
answer in the sense

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:84%
that she doesn't
say what's coming.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Instead, she draws the
person's awareness back

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:90%
to this present moment.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And she emphasizes
how important it

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.975 align:middle line:84%
is to stay connected and stay
anchored in this present moment.

00:22:28.975 --> 00:22:30.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
do you channel her?

00:22:30.995 --> 00:22:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, I connect
with her every day.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So I'm still getting
up to meditate.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you do.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Not quite as early.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't get up at 4 any more.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She starts you day.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Yeah.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.980 align:middle line:84%
But I do-- that's how I start my
day is I do get up to meditate.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So I do connect with
her every single day.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I channel
her every Tuesday

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.230 align:middle line:84%
for a guided meditation
for my community.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we do ongoing events
as well throughout the month.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you channel
her at any time you want?

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Pretty much.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:90%
I just call her in.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I shift my state, so I
channel in an altered state.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a few moments
for me to shift my state.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:90%
And then yeah.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:90%
And then I start channeling her.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you aware of
what you're channeling?

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: I am aware, but
my experience, George,

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:90%
is that I'm off to the side.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.228 align:middle line:84%
So I experienced
Sarai on my left.

00:23:20.228 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I start
channeling her, it's

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:84%
as if this energy starts
sort of broadcasting

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.310 align:middle line:84%
through me coming
in on the left,

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:90%
and then I move to the right.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm channeling,
I do have an awareness

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.550 align:middle line:90%
of what is being said.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I do remember for the first
few moments after I come back,

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:90%
I do remember what was said.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
similar to waking up

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.845 align:middle line:84%
in the morning when
you've just had a dream.

00:23:42.845 --> 00:23:43.887 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little groggy.

00:23:43.887 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: You remember that dream.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
You remember it
for a few minutes.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And then within 20
minutes, it's gone.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:10%
So after about 20
minutes, half an hour,

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:10%
I don't have a recollection
of what was said.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So I really appreciate
the fact that I

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:84%
record a lot so that
I can listen back

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.395 align:middle line:90%
to the channeled sessions.

00:24:02.395 --> 00:24:04.186 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
let's channel Sarai.

00:24:04.186 --> 00:24:05.015 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: OK.

00:24:05.015 --> 00:24:05.815 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:24:05.815 --> 00:24:09.650 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are you doing now?

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: So I'm just--

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I use essential oil to help
me get into an altered state.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So when I meditate early in
the morning, I use this oil

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and it sort of helps me create a
connection between that altered

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:29.110 align:middle line:84%
state, so I can
return to that later.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.180 align:middle line:90%
And you just rub it in?

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: I just rub it in,
and then I just smell it

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.065 align:middle line:84%
and I move it through
my auric field.

00:24:36.065 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: So she'll probably
speak for a moment or two,

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and then she'll
take your questions.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.315 align:middle line:90%
So just be a moment.

00:24:44.315 --> 00:25:27.470 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.110 align:middle line:84%
We've been looking forward
to this interaction

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and we appreciate
your participation

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.470 align:middle line:90%
with this interaction.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And to begin on this day,
we'll just say a few words.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.500 align:middle line:84%
We know you have
questions for us.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But where we'd like
to begin on this day

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:46.190 align:middle line:84%
is we'd like to bring you
this very important reminder

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and this remembrance of who
you are as a being of light.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And so if you would
just take a moment--

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and all those listening,
just take a moment

00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:01.190 align:middle line:84%
to begin to step back and
remember who you were before you

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.130 align:middle line:84%
incarnated into this
form and start to see,

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.240 align:middle line:84%
sense, feel, know,
recognize yourselves

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:84%
as these incredible
beings of light,

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:84%
vast beings of light,
eternal consciousness,

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.120 align:middle line:90%
eternal awareness.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And start to slightly
distance yourselves

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.300 align:middle line:84%
from this human construct
or this human avatar,

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
which of course, is your vehicle
and your vessel for having

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.750 align:middle line:90%
this human incarnation.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.300 align:middle line:84%
However, it is
not your identity.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And so take a very deep breath
in this moment and take that in.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale, begin
to release everything

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.380 align:middle line:90%
that does not serve you.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.770 align:middle line:84%
All energies, anything
you are holding

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.883 align:middle line:84%
within your field that does not
serve you, that is outdated.

00:26:46.883 --> 00:26:49.890 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And so how may we
serve you on this day?

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:53.675 align:middle line:84%
What questions do
you have for us?

00:26:53.675 --> 00:26:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarai, how
did you get your name?

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, the
name Sarai was a name

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:84%
that I offered to Karen so
that she would have a reference

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:08.600 align:middle line:84%
point for interacting with me
and for interacting with us.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:84%
However, it is not accurate
to say that we have names

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.920 align:middle line:90%
in the same way that you do.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So it is a name that I
created in order for Karen

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:23.212 align:middle line:90%
to interact with me and with us.

00:27:23.212 --> 00:27:27.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is humanity
awakened yet?

00:27:27.325 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Some humans are
awakened and some are not.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.410 align:middle line:84%
What is very
important to recognize

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:40.420 align:middle line:84%
in terms of collective awakening
is that every individual being

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.820 align:middle line:84%
is serving the frequency
of the collective,

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.100 align:middle line:90%
contributing to the collective.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So every individual matters in
a sense, and so every individual

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:90%
makes this contribution.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.625 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
understand that, you

00:27:57.625 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:84%
understand that your
individual contribution

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:06.150 align:middle line:84%
in terms of awakening or
ascension is very important.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of
you is very important.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It is very much like
a jigsaw puzzle,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:17.040 align:middle line:84%
where you fit into a very
specific space in that puzzle.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.890 align:middle line:84%
No one else can fit
into that space.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So fill into that in this
moment, and fill into your value

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being part of
this collective consciousness.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Many of those who are
listening, including you,

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:84%
have come here as a sort of
servants of this ascension

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.980 align:middle line:84%
process, meaning you are here
to serve the ascension process

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.366 align:middle line:84%
and be guides and be
lights for others.

00:28:46.366 --> 00:28:50.106 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarai, why is it
important for people to ascend?

00:28:50.106 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: It's important for
people to ascend in the sense

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that this collective and
ascension that is happening

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.580 align:middle line:84%
is serving your

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.240 align:middle line:90%
It's ensuring your future.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So you could think
of in this way

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:84%
that your collective
has experienced

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:84%
its current level
of consciousness

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.230 align:middle line:90%
for many moments in time.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And it has been an
interesting experience.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:22.370 align:middle line:84%
However, like all things in
life, everything is growing,

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:24.110 align:middle line:90%
everything is moving forward.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it is now
time for all of you

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.540 align:middle line:84%
to make this shift so that
you can have a new experience.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:84%

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:40.946 align:middle line:84%
destroy your civilization, which

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:41.746 align:middle line:90%
beautiful.

to match the frequency
of your higher self.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:00.040 align:middle line:84%
It is the vibrational alignment
between your human self

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.230 align:middle line:84%
or your human construct, and
your higher self or your soul.

>>NOORY: How do
people break through

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.420 align:middle line:84%
to find out what
their purpose is?

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: So there
is much we could

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:90%
say about this idea of purpose.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.670 align:middle line:84%
We would first begin by
saying that your purpose is

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:23.190 align:middle line:90%
to be authentically yourself.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:90%
It's to be you.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And what we mean by
that is that when

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:31.530 align:middle line:84%
you are born into this physical
reality, you are your pure self.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.330 align:middle line:90%
You are your authentic self.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:84%
But over time, you
begin to take on all

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:84%
of these interesting
thought forms

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and emotional charges related
to those thought forms.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, that
starts to deplete or affect

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:90%
your energy body.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And so you become
less of yourself.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
awaken spiritually

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and you go through
this ascension process,

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:84%
it is-- you could think of it
as the process of becoming more

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.850 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:04.565 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very important
experience for a soul to have.

00:31:04.565 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we seem
to always fight and argue

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.450 align:middle line:90%
with each other?

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: You fight and
argue with each other

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.110 align:middle line:84%
because you are misidentified
with who you truly are.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you think that
you are this body,

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.770 align:middle line:84%
and you think that
you are this mind,

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and you think that you are these
thoughts, then what happens

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.370 align:middle line:84%
is you are identified with
those thought forms you

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.260 align:middle line:90%
think those are your identity.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you think
that you have to defend them.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.710 align:middle line:84%
When you defend
your perspective,

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:84%
what you are really doing is you
are defending a false identity.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And so again, when
you awaken spiritually

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to separate
your true identity

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:84%
from your false identity,
there is no longer

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.645 align:middle line:90%
any need for fighting.

00:31:50.645 --> 00:31:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many people
struggle trying

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:90%

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:84%
What recommendations would
you give people like that?

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: We would say finding
your true identity for many that

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.870 align:middle line:84%
are incarnated on
the Earth plane

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:09.140 align:middle line:84%
at this time is very much like
taking off a very heavy coat.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So again, if you think of
these mental constructs

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that you take on-- and
by mental constructs,

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.990 align:middle line:84%
we are speaking of the
thought forms and the beliefs

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and the perspectives that
are not necessarily your own,

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:24.440 align:middle line:84%
but that have been projected
upon you by others.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And you take all of that on, and
it cloaks your true identity.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And so finding
your true identity

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and finding your purpose is
not so much about taking on

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:84%
as it is releasing the layers,
all of that, which is not truly

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Again, we ask you to step back
into this witness consciousness,

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:49.030 align:middle line:84%
which is the space that
allows you to witness

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.590 align:middle line:84%
your human self from
a bit of a distance,

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.030 align:middle line:84%
so you are no longer so
attached to the thought forms

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that you think and the
subsequent emotions that you

00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.020 align:middle line:90%
feel.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And so you're able from witness
consciousness to evaluate,

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:06.160 align:middle line:84%
does this thought, or does
this perspective serve me?

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Does it feel like joy
in my energy body?

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Does it feel like it is
aligned and connected

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:15.610 align:middle line:84%
with God, with source, with the
universe, with my higher self?

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Or does it feel like this is
a program or a construct that

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:23.490 align:middle line:84%
has been projected or
programmed into me that I've

full of very interesting ideas,
very interesting thought forms,

very interesting perspectives.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:07.220 align:middle line:84%

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:15.190 align:middle line:84%
They are not necessarily

with a capital L,
Life or source or God.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.070 align:middle line:84%
They are just ideas that
you are playing with

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:24.230 align:middle line:84%
that you are trying on, just
like you're trying on clothes.

You can try on a shirt and
feel into how that feels.

You can do the same
thing with thoughts.

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.250 align:middle line:84%
The mental construct
is part of the vessel

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.060 align:middle line:90%

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.090 align:middle line:84%

have the mind or the mental
body or the mental construct.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.880 align:middle line:84%
It is part of how you

00:36:09.682 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: The limiting
beliefs that you hold

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and that you carry,
the predominant ones,

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.600 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are most
problematic in your collective

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.810 align:middle line:84%
consciousness at this time
are the ones, again, that

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.280 align:middle line:90%
are related to your identity.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.400 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
are the thought forms

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and the beliefs that reflect
who you think you are.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And many of these, we
would say, are inaccurate

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.140 align:middle line:90%
and they limit you.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.060 align:middle line:90%
So we'll give you an example.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And so as we gaze at many of
you, we see your energy fields.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And for many of you,
there is a certain amount

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.180 align:middle line:90%
of debris in your energy fields.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Meaning there are these mental
and emotional, you could say,

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:54.060 align:middle line:84%
particles floating around
in your energy field that

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:58.230 align:middle line:84%
are the result of a past
experience that you have not yet

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.590 align:middle line:90%
integrated.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when it comes to
these mental constructs

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.790 align:middle line:84%
or these beliefs around
identity, you could say--

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:10.030 align:middle line:84%
here's an example, in your
younger years, let's say,

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:15.270 align:middle line:84%
a being had a situation where
they were bullied or mistreated

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:16.420 align:middle line:90%
by a parent.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And so they would start
thinking this thought

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.130 align:middle line:84%
or creating this perspective
that who I am is not enough

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:25.200 align:middle line:84%
or there's something
wrong with me.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And the subsequent emotion
related to that thought form

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.040 align:middle line:90%
would be shame.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And so you are carrying this
debris around in your energy

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:middle line:84%
field until you
begin to witness it,

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.690 align:middle line:84%
until you begin to
awaken to the fact

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:39.640 align:middle line:84%
that that's not true, that
that's not who you are.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.360 align:middle line:84%
What happens until that
point, though, is that belief,

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and the energy of that belief
is reflected back to you

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:90%
in your reality.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So how that limits
you is you may

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:55.000 align:middle line:84%
have very important desires,
desires of your heart, that you

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.520 align:middle line:84%
wish to experience, or
ways in which you want

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.210 align:middle line:90%
to express out in the world.

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.287 align:middle line:84%
And yet you are
blocked by this belief

00:38:01.287 --> 00:38:02.870 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
wrong with you.

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:04.760 align:middle line:90%
So you can't ever step forward.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And so spiritual awakening
and this process of ascension

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:12.070 align:middle line:84%
really is the secret,
or the key to everything

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.960 align:middle line:84%
that you are looking
for, everything

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.126 align:middle line:90%
that you are desiring.

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us
some suggestions

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:20.166 align:middle line:84%
on how we should connect
with our own soul self.

00:38:20.166 --> 00:38:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: So the most
important thing

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.580 align:middle line:84%
to recognize about
your soul self

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is that it makes
itself known to you

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and it communicates to
you in a field of silence.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And so when your mind
or your mental construct

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:39.580 align:middle line:84%
is overly active,
overly busy, when

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.660 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of thought
forms and the mind is running,

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.770 align:middle line:90%
then your soul is there.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Your soul is present.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Yet you can't feel it.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:53.180 align:middle line:84%
You can't feel that luminous
presence that is your soul.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So we would say
the way to connect

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:58.550 align:middle line:84%
with your soul is
through sitting quietly,

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.290 align:middle line:90%
through sitting in meditation.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you recognize that
the mind is still running,

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.210 align:middle line:90%
the mind is still active.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.920 align:middle line:84%
But even in that recognition,
that you are not the mind

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and you are recognizing,
OK, this mind

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.876 align:middle line:84%
is having a lot
of thought forms.

00:39:13.876 --> 00:39:16.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
activity happening here.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But where is the
witness of that?

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And so as you begin to step
back and center yourself

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:26.120 align:middle line:84%
as that witness, again, you
will start to feel a presence.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.130 align:middle line:84%
That presence is
always with you.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.430 align:middle line:84%
That is the presence
of your higher self

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:32.716 align:middle line:84%
or your soul or
your true identity.

00:39:32.716 --> 00:39:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarai, what do you
think the true purpose of life

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.040 align:middle line:90%
is?

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, we speak often
about the purpose of life

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.660 align:middle line:90%
because it is a common question.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we've broken down the
purpose of life into what we

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:46.530 align:middle line:90%
call the 3 E's.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And those 3 E's are experience,
expression, and evolution.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Experience,
expression, evolution.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's just speak
briefly about each one.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Experience is reflective of
the fact that, as a soul,

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.360 align:middle line:84%
you are excited
about just having

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.350 align:middle line:90%
this experience of being human.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way
you go to a movie

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and you get excited
about the storyline

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and you immerse yourself
in what's happening,

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.870 align:middle line:90%
same is true for your soul.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Your soul is very
appreciative and eager

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.660 align:middle line:84%
of the chance of just
having this very interesting

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.660 align:middle line:90%
human experience.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first purpose--

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.450 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:25.080 align:middle line:84%
The second purpose
is expression.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, understand that the
energy of your soul is unique.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of you
have a unique soul signature,

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.030 align:middle line:84%
that is seeking
to express itself

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.290 align:middle line:90%
through the human construct.

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.870 align:middle line:84%
It's seeking to express
this energy outwards.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And each and every being
does that differently.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.170 align:middle line:84%
But there is a desire
within the soul

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:47.770 align:middle line:84%
to express its energy out
through the human construct

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:49.660 align:middle line:90%
in many different ways.

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.990 align:middle line:84%
The third E, in terms of the
purpose of life, is evolution.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And evolution happens
naturally with the first two.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So you have this experience
and you express yourself--

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and then evolution is something
that happens as a byproduct.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.180 align:middle line:90%
So you grow.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.680 align:middle line:90%
You grow as a soul.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.120 align:middle line:90%
You grow as a human.

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.320 align:middle line:90%
You move forward.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.720 align:middle line:84%
You experience and you
explore different things,

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.700 align:middle line:84%
which leads to your
learning and your growth.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:17.445 align:middle line:84%
So those are the three purposes
of life from our perspective.

this message about

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.790 align:middle line:84%
coming back to the
truth of your identity.

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Many of you, again,
are misidentified,

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:40.880 align:middle line:84%
meaning that you think you
are these little humans,

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and that sense that you are
just this human with just

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:49.050 align:middle line:84%
this body and just this mind
is very limiting in nature.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.300 align:middle line:84%
If you start to
even in this moment,

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.510 align:middle line:84%
start to feel into the
presence of your higher

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.150 align:middle line:84%
self or your soul,
you'll recognize just

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.770 align:middle line:84%
how infinite you are,
just how vast you are,

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.270 align:middle line:90%
just how beautiful you are.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.910 align:middle line:84%
You will begin to have
reverence for yourself.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:05.370 align:middle line:84%
You will begin to
believe in yourself.

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:10.370 align:middle line:84%
You will begin to come and know
and understand how wondrous

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and how incredible
your purpose is.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You'll begin to understand
the divine order

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:20.490 align:middle line:84%
behind all things, even chaotic
events, chaotic experiences.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And all of this will bring
you a sense of peace,

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.760 align:middle line:84%
so that you can continue
to live this human life.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you will go on
to do the exact same thing

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:30.780 align:middle line:90%
as you did yesterday.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:35.130 align:middle line:84%

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:34.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll be honest.

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:35.380 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Not as much as it did
when I first started.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:40.640 align:middle line:84%
When I first started channeling,
I would honestly have to have--

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.265 align:middle line:84%
I would channel for
an hour, and then I

00:43:42.265 --> 00:43:43.880 align:middle line:84%
would need a few
hours of recovery.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I found that as
time has gone by,

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.966 align:middle line:84%
I can acclimate to the
energy much quicker.

00:43:49.966 --> 00:43:53.655 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is Sarai a starseed?

00:43:53.655 --> 00:43:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Sarai is not
necessarily a starseed.

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.425 align:middle line:84%
I could be considered the
starseed in the relationship.

00:43:59.425 --> 00:44:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or me.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: I think you're
a starseed, George.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I definitely think
you're a starseed.

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.748 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why do you think so?

00:44:04.748 --> 00:44:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: I think so because
you emanate this energy.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And it feels to me like you
have this divine purpose

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.210 align:middle line:90%
of assisting humanity.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is a starseed's
primary directive.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:21.800 align:middle line:84%
It's to support the shift
in consciousness right now.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Am I a hybrid?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.165 align:middle line:90%
Did they put me here?

00:44:24.165 --> 00:44:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: I don't know.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what type
of starseed you are.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:29.380 align:middle line:84%
It would be interesting
to find out.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is
your higher self?

00:44:31.215 --> 00:44:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: So I think
of my higher self

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:38.560 align:middle line:90%
as just the energy of my soul.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing
about the higher self

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.420 align:middle line:84%
that I've discovered
through Sarai

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:47.530 align:middle line:84%
is that it tends to have what
she calls these fractals.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So it fractalizes
itself into all

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.960 align:middle line:90%
of these different incarnations.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So you're probably familiar
with the term "past lives."

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.890 align:middle line:84%
But what Sarai says is that
all of these lives that we

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.480 align:middle line:84%
think are past are really
just happening simultaneously.

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On different planets?

00:45:02.885 --> 00:45:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: It can be different
planets, for sure.

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what a
starseed is actually.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Starseed is a soul,
a type of soul,

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:14.910 align:middle line:84%
who has a connection to other
civilizations on other planets

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:17.450 align:middle line:84%
because they're having
parallel incarnations there.

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does somebody
know if they're a starseed?

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Oh, that's a
beautiful question.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.470 align:middle line:90%
So there are a few indicators.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I would say one of the most
common indicators is just

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.810 align:middle line:84%
a felt sense of not belonging
here, of not fitting in.

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:33.297 align:middle line:90%
Some starseeds even feel--

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little unusual.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: A little unusual.

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:38.410 align:middle line:90%
They might feel like aliens.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.032 align:middle line:84%
Even though they might not know
this terminology of starseeds,

00:45:41.032 --> 00:45:43.240 align:middle line:84%
they might just feel like
this planet is very foreign

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know
how to operate here.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Starseeds can also be very
sensitive, very intuitive.

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:53.240 align:middle line:90%
They can be natural healers.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.240 align:middle line:90%
They're often natural healers.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And then a third
indicator often, George,

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:01.900 align:middle line:84%
is this understanding that
because starseeds are here

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.610 align:middle line:84%
to shift energy, that
when they do incarnate,

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:09.130 align:middle line:84%
they often very intentionally
incarnate into family lines who

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:11.170 align:middle line:84%
have a history of
difficulty or trauma,

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:14.385 align:middle line:84%
so that they have some
energy to transmute or heal.

00:46:14.385 --> 00:46:16.958 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many different
kinds of starseeds are there?

00:46:16.958 --> 00:46:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: I think there are
so many different types

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:19.800 align:middle line:90%
of starseeds.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.520 align:middle line:90%
It's probably uncountable.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:46:22.405 --> 00:46:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: I think so.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we do through channeling
and through hypnosis, I

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.060 align:middle line:84%
think we have awareness of some
of the different star races

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.450 align:middle line:90%
and types of star seeds.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But I really think
that it's just

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.410 align:middle line:84%
a sliver of what's
really out there.

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:39.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
starseed's true purpose?

00:46:39.355 --> 00:46:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, again, a
starseed's true purpose

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:44.940 align:middle line:84%
is assisting with the evolution
of human consciousness.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So again, if you think of
our collective consciousness,

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.910 align:middle line:84%
as this unified field
of thought forms,

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:53.910 align:middle line:84%
starseeds are here to
support and upgrade.

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of an
upgrade in software,

00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:59.850 align:middle line:84%
we're due, George, for an
upgrade in consciousness.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.205 align:middle line:84%
And so starseeds are here
to assist with that process.

00:47:03.205 --> 00:47:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So somebody watching
Beyond Belief right now, Karen.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And they suspect that they
may be a starseed, what

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.040 align:middle line:90%
advice do you give them?

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: My biggest
advice for starseeds

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:18.020 align:middle line:84%
would be do not feel
like you need to fit in.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So starseeds have this sense
sometimes of loneliness

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:25.087 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes of depression
because they don't fit in

00:47:25.087 --> 00:47:25.920 align:middle line:90%
with the collective.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.910 align:middle line:90%
They think differently.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:27.710 align:middle line:90%
They act differently.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:28.990 align:middle line:90%
They make different decisions.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.460 align:middle line:84%
They're even drawn to different
foods and different media.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a starseed,
you are not here to fit in.

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:38.773 align:middle line:84%
You're actually here to be an
emanation of a different energy.

00:47:38.773 --> 00:47:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you an outcast?

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: What's that?

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.807 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you an outcast?

00:47:41.807 --> 00:47:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Well, you can be
until you find your tribe.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a good idea to
connect with other starseeds

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.815 align:middle line:84%
so you can feel supported
and you don't feel alone.

00:47:50.815 --> 00:47:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we get
more information on Sarai?

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: So Sarai, you
can find me and Sarai.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:00.260 align:middle line:10%

Or if you check out
my YouTube channel,

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.560 align:middle line:10%
you can search Intuitive

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.070 align:middle line:10%
and see all of my channeled
videos of Sarai on YouTube.

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What words of wisdom
would you leave all of us?

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BELL: Oh, I would say spend
time in silence every day,

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.230 align:middle line:84%
because that will connect you
with your true self, your higher

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.600 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how do we do that?

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BELL: Meditate, George.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a very
loud, boisterous world,

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.080 align:middle line:90%
how do we spend time in silence?

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.450 align:middle line:10%
>>BELL: Yes, this is why I
started getting up at 4 AM,

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:29.450 align:middle line:10%
because that's a
very quiet time.

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:32.785 align:middle line:10%
So if you're going
through a difficult time,

00:48:32.785 --> 00:48:34.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm not saying you
have to get up at 4,

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:37.920 align:middle line:10%
but those periods of silence
are really important.

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And that period of
time between 5 and 7

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:43.770 align:middle line:84%
AM is usually a very
still quiet time.

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And so it can be difficult
to get up that early

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:49.488 align:middle line:84%
and start that practice, but
it will shift everything.

00:48:49.488 --> 00:48:50.530 align:middle line:90%
It will change your life.

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm still
awake at that time.

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.090 align:middle line:90%
