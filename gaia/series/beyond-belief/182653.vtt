00:00:06.902 --> 00:00:24.658 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:10%
Glenn Steckling is the director
of the 60-year-old George

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:10%
Adamski Foundation.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's one of the
oldest and still existing

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:90%
UFO organizations.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle line:10%
He is the son of UFO researchers
Fred and Ingrid Steckling,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.890 align:middle line:10%
who are friends and
co-workers of a person we're

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:10%
going to talk about today,
George Adamski, considered

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.170 align:middle line:10%
by many as the pioneer in the
early UFO contactee field.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Hey, welcome to the program.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GLENN STECKLING:
Thank you, George.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.282 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be with you.

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I remember as a
kid getting involved in UFOs

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:10%
and reading books and doing
whatever investigating I

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:10%
could as a 10 or 11-year-old.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:10%
I came across the they
were Georgia Adamski.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.250 align:middle line:10%
And I was fascinated by this
guy, because at the time,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:10%
he may have been
the first person

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.672 align:middle line:10%
to talk about UFO contactees.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Didn't he talk
about-- weren't they

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.985 align:middle line:84%
from Venus or
something like that?

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: He talked
about contactees

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.653 align:middle line:84%
in this solar system, that's
correct, not just Venus.

00:01:21.653 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the guy.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Who was George Adamski?

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: He was a
most unique individual.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:10%
I would say that, for being
selected as a contactee,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:10%
they did their jobs very well.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.610 align:middle line:84%
George was intently respectful
of this information.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:84%
He was very cognizant of
how it was represented.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And he always
believed it wasn't him

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that was the
important factor, it

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.010 align:middle line:84%
was the message in the
information that was important.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
So during the late
'40s, '50s, and '60s,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:84%
he interacted with scientists,
political officials,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
anybody who wished to
come to the property.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:90%
He gave them free photographs.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:84%
He showed them the
motion picture films

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:84%
that he took, which
we will look at later.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And he was well known as being
one of the most vocal, not

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
the only contactee, but
one of the most vocal

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:90%
and the most connected.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
He briefed Eisenhower in
1958 at an air base out

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
in the California desert, which
one of these craft landed,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and also John Kennedy in 1962,
which he carried a White House

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
access card for the Kennedy
administration in his wallet.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:10%
He showed it to us.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And so between these
type of contacts

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and this type of
information centers,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
he was probably the
most unique person

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:84%
to ever participate in this
particular subject, which

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:84%
drew a lot of scorn and envy
in some circles but a lot

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:90%
of respect in the others.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember my parents
talking about him, especially

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
my mom, because
she was into this.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:84%
She just loved these UFO
stories and things like that.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:84%
How was George Adamski
looked at during that era?

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Was he looked at as
somebody very credible?

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:90%
Was he looked at as a whacko?

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.772 align:middle line:90%
How did the public perceive him?

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
I think you have

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:90%
a contingent of both sides.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:84%
But as we've showed in the,
book "Behind the Flying Saucer

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Mystery II," I
went into archives

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and pulled out a lot
of the documentation

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:84%
from known scientists, from
people like Frank Edwards

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.258 align:middle line:84%
and others that showed
correspondence with George

00:03:27.258 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:84%
in which they treated
him very respectfully

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and which he gave
them information.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:84%
NICAP gave him a
membership card.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say that
within official circles,

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:90%
he was very well respected.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:10%
I remember when he lectured
in DC at the Air Force

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:10%
Reserves and other lectures,
the military in uniform

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:10%
sat in the front row.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they were
serious, weren't they?

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Very serious.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And they knew
exactly who he was,

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
because he had given them
abundant information when

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:90%
he went on his space ride.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:84%
He described the
moon, the atmosphere,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
conditions in space,
all of these things.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:84%
That was in 1955 before
our space program.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And he also said that when
he went on-board these craft,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.090 align:middle line:84%
there was always another
official, a government

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:84%
official, a military official,
as well on board, recognizable.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:10%
So when J. Edgar Hoover wanted
to have him investigated

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.800 align:middle line:10%
for communist activity,
because he didn't like anybody

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:10%
who had such inclinations
of peace and well-being,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.580 align:middle line:10%
that George says, fine,
call me to testify.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I will give all the
names, locations,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and dates of everybody
else that was there.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:90%
And the case dropped.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have the
file in my archives.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those people probably
called Hoover like, hey,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.932 align:middle line:90%
I was there, back off.

00:04:38.932 --> 00:04:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Who knows?

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is this that
he was well-recognized

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:90%
and very well-regarded.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would say the greatest
issue was that later

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:84%
on in our space program, when
we decided to carry forth

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.833 align:middle line:84%
the denial program of denying
the UFOs in the '50s--

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which we still are.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Which we still are.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they were
going to go public.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle line:84%
In 1952 after the
July incident of which

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
they flew over the
Washington capitol in DC

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and they scrambled the
shooting stars to chase them,

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
the military printed
130 million leaflets

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in which they were going to
go and inform the public.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.065 align:middle line:10%
And Hoyt Vandenberg nixed that.

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And
so they wanted to,

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and then they decided
to go divergent.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And when NASA went
into space, as we

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
looked at some of
the space pictures,

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.655 align:middle line:84%
we will see that exactly what
George talked about exists.

00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:84%
But we want to keep the denial
factor of intelligent life

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
in this solar system as
much separate as possible,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
because that is
perceived as a threat.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.210 align:middle line:84%
When somebody lives next door
to you, they can come visit.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
If they have a better way
of life, then we want it.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And that can change our whole
social economic structure.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.640 align:middle line:84%
So we prefer to push intelligent
extraterrestrial life

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:84%
into the distant
reaches of space,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.890 align:middle line:84%
because the distance is
too far for us to verify.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.305 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it remains a
kind of a nebulous tangent.

00:06:06.305 --> 00:06:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
your parents get

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:90%
involved with George Adamski?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
my father and mother

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
both witnessed the foo fighters
and these UFOs over Germany

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:90%
during the war.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.982 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The war, that's right.

00:06:16.982 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And my father
had a very large scale

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.973 align:middle line:84%
map in which he put these
little pins, like we

00:06:21.973 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
used to do in the old days,
colored pins in the map of all

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:90%
the UFO sightings.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.282 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And foo fighters,
by the way, for people

00:06:27.282 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:84%
who don't know,
were little disks

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.707 align:middle line:84%
that many pilots during
the war witnessed

00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:90%
flying all over the place.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: In formation
alongside of bomber squadrons.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so they had
seen some of these craft.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
came to the States,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:84%
when we lived out here, in
fact in Colorado in 1962,

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:84%
there were a number of sightings
out in the Colorado area.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:90%
We moved to Washington in '63.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:84%
We saw a bell-shaped craft
hanging over the city

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.223 align:middle line:90%
at 1,500 feet.

00:06:55.223 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:84%
There was a reporter for
"The Washington Daily News"

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and about 45 other witnesses.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:90%
And it was in the paper.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So my father said, you know,
I need to know what this is.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:10%
So he goes to the Library
of Congress, starts

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.575 align:middle line:10%
alphabetically, A for
Adamski, there's the books,

00:07:08.575 --> 00:07:10.017 align:middle line:10%
finds "Flying
Saucers have Landed"

00:07:10.017 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:10%
and, inside, "The Space Ships--"

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tracked them down?

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.533 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: --in which
there were the photographs

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:15.900 align:middle line:10%
of exactly what we'd seen.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.872 align:middle line:10%
He wrote to them in Vista,
California, where I now live.

00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And George says, I'm coming
out to lecture to the Air Force

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Reserves.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:90%
We'll meet.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.575 align:middle line:84%
And when they met, they became
fast friends and co-workers

00:07:25.575 --> 00:07:27.040 align:middle line:90%
and confidants of George.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And for the last two
years of his life,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:84%
we worked to arrange press
conferences and radio shows

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and enjoyed the privilege
of some of his contacts.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a
very dynamic period.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did
George Adamski start

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:90%
witnessing this situation?

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:90%
When was he taken?

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen for him?

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, he got
his first telescope in 1938.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:84%
If you look in "The
Los Angeles Times,"

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.030 align:middle line:84%
there's a picture of
him at Laguna Beach

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:90%
with his first telescope.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
He took some
photographs in late 1940

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and submitted it to
the US government.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:84%
We were just going into World
War II shortly thereafter,

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
so the whole thing kind
of just simmered down.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
moved to Mount Palomar

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
in the late '40s
and '50s, that's

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.150 align:middle line:84%
when he started taking
his telescopic shots

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:90%
and some motion picture film.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:10%
And so George was
already lecturing

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.230 align:middle line:10%
in the early 1930s concerning
extraterrestrial life,

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.620 align:middle line:10%
the universal principles that
govern nature, no matter where

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.400 align:middle line:10%
you go in the cosmos.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a natural
transgression-- or transition

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.560 align:middle line:90%
rather, pardon me.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or transgression.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: Well, it was a
transition, in which it seemed

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:10%
quite natural, and in fact, as
we know during World War II,

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.108 align:middle line:10%
the sightings of
these craft over LA

00:08:42.108 --> 00:08:43.650 align:middle line:10%
caused a bit of
panic and scrambling.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They sure did.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And then when
we started our atomic tests,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:84%
that's when these craft
came in heavy numbers

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.530 align:middle line:90%
to monitor our tests.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the
reasons for his famous contact

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:90%
in Desert Center in 1952.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
approach him first,

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:84%
or did he ask for
them to come see him?

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: No,
they approached him.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a very careful
screening process that goes on.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
They don't do anything
without purpose.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And they don't do anything
without careful consideration

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
of consequence, because
in reality, this

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.560 align:middle line:84%
changes your entire
life, how you

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
deal with things, how you see
things, whom you interact with,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:84%
your professional capabilities,
and what have you.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And George got a
whole bunch of scorn

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.670 align:middle line:90%
for some things he never did.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so
that screening process

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:90%
is very carefully done.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of
the contactees.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
There were two
sisters in Norway,

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.010 align:middle line:90%
the lady in South Africa.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
There was a number of them
all around the planet.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
George who came out

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.650 align:middle line:90%
as one of their representatives.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:84%
They basically told him,
we have screened you.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
We think that you would make
a very good representative.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you accept,
then we will give you

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:90%
as much support as possible.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
that no matter where

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:84%
he went in his world
tours, he always

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.750 align:middle line:90%
was in the company of them.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And they always had
sightings wherever he went,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:84%
reported by the locals
and the newspapers.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So he had a vast
amount of support,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
which is necessary
in our society,

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.100 align:middle line:84%
because the only thing we know
how to do is tear things down.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When did he die?

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.258 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: 1965.

00:10:19.258 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you ever meet him?

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Oh,
yeah, I knew him

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:90%
for the last years of his life.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a little
boy, you were?

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: In fact, as
I was describing earlier,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:84%
George would say to me I've
got two space visitors coming.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to sit in
the dining room table.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:84%
You're going to zip your
mouth closed and listen.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You witnessed this?

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: I witnessed it.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:38.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do they look like?

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Just
like you and I.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
that sect, that race.

00:10:42.385 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That grouping.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because of rays
and everything else.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: They sat.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.350 align:middle line:90%
They came in.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And they discussed
with him, OK, we're

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.850 align:middle line:84%
going to be at this in
this place and this time.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Have your camera ready
and what have you.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I interacted with
them already at that age.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And those same individuals
came and helped

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.800 align:middle line:84%
my father when he wrote his
first book, "Why are They Here?

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Spaceships From Other Worlds,"
which came out in 1969.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And I've had the
privilege of having

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:84%
run into them over the decades
that follow every so often.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this is not
something I can control.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who says that they
can summon space people

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.900 align:middle line:84%
is full of it, because
they come when they believe

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:90%
the opportunity is necessary.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: George Adamski
took some incredible film.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Yes.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.198 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want
you to tell us some

00:11:33.198 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:90%
of the things we're looking at.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Yes.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.818 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.818 --> 00:11:39.360 align:middle line:84%
These are what are
called high flyers

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the screen.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So when you see these craft
with their energy field fully

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:84%
energized, it envelops
the entire craft

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.050 align:middle line:84%
in kind of a pearlescent,
multicolored luminescence.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
see this craft.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:10%
When they are close
to the ground,

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:10%
you'll see in this
Mexico footage

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:10%
in 1958, in the
very corner there

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:10%
is the dome of the scout ship.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, you can see its
north-south polarity right

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:10%
through.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:90%
It's almost luminescent.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:90%
It's see-through.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:90%
And you can see these.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.683 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
enlargements from the film

00:12:13.683 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:84%
that we did in the new
book, "The George Adamski

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Story" that Renee Olson did.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And this particular film
was very significant.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:90%
This picture I got of archives.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:84%
This was over Mount Palomar
of a cigar-shaped mothership.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:84%
But look at all the little
crafts, some of them energized

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.450 align:middle line:84%
field, some of them
not yet, all around,

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:84%
surrounding this
cigar-shaped mothership.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.398 align:middle line:90%
And a magnificent photo.

00:12:37.398 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And every time I go
through archives,

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I find more negatives and
glass plates and photographs

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:90%
from George.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Lado De Loma's over Vista,
very close to where I live.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:84%
You'll see this craft come
into view over downtown Vista.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.332 align:middle line:84%
And it goes here, behind
the telephone lines.

00:12:54.332 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's clearly
not a plane, Glenn.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING:
Clearly not a plane.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.270 align:middle line:84%
It's as clear as you could get
and maneuvers with high speed.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.030 align:middle line:10%
And you'll notice
that it stays fixated

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:10%
in its three-dimensional field.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:10%
It does not wobble like a top.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.920 align:middle line:10%
That's not correct.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
When you see somebody's
film or pictures

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
where it shows a craft wobbling
like a top or a gyroscope,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:90%
that's not real.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:84%
The following section
is of the newer craft

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.520 align:middle line:84%
that has replaced the
bell-shaped craft.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.650 align:middle line:84%
The bell-shaped craft
requires a carrier craft

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to go in space, where this one
can go from planet to planet

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.230 align:middle line:84%
in space completely
self-sufficient,

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:90%
self sustained.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adamski was
doing this even way

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:84%
before Billy Meier
in Switzerland, huh?

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Long
before Billy Meier.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
This particular
film is excellent,

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:84%
because it shows
the maneuverability

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:84%
of this craft not only laterally
but forward and backwards

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and the high acceleration
rate of its maneuvering,

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.852 align:middle line:84%
equivalent to what would
be probably 100 Gs--

00:13:53.852 --> 00:13:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at it go.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: --in
our own system.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And this craft feels
nothing but one 1 g.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.288 align:middle line:84%
1 g on the floor, no matter
what position it's at.

00:14:03.288 --> 00:14:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: That's only
part of Adamski's films.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what did
he do with the film

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:84%
when he shot it
and developed it?

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:90%
Did he show it to groups?

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:90%
What did he do with it?

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: All
over the planet, yes.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.698 align:middle line:90%
He showed it to the military.

00:14:14.698 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:90%
He showed it to groups.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:84%
He showed it to anybody
who was willing to see it.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
The last film that was taken
in Silver Springs in 1965

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:84%
at the end of February has
one of these craft up close.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And it retracts and extends
one of its three ball

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.890 align:middle line:90%
condensers on the bottom.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And the registering disc that
came before it, that was shown.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
My father arranged the
international press conference

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:84%
in March 10 of that year
in the Mayflower Hotel.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And all the top news
agencies were there,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:84%
including the ambassadorial
staff, which my mother had

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:90%
sent the invitations to.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were astounded
at George's films,

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.190 align:middle line:84%
because, as Colonel Freeman
said in the Pentagon

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:84%
in '67 when he invited
my father, after NASA

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.360 align:middle line:84%
in the same year, he said these
are some of the best films I've

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.680 align:middle line:90%
ever seen in civilian hands.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, there's a book
out, "The George Adamski

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Story," by Rene Olson which
depicts some photos that I want

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.157 align:middle line:90%
you to explain for us well.

00:15:11.157 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I
supplied Rene with some

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:90%
of these original photos.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.170 align:middle line:84%
This one shows the Desert Center
contact with the mothership

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.545 align:middle line:90%
and the two scouts above it.

00:15:19.545 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who are
these people here?

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: George is
here with the safari hat.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.650 align:middle line:84%
You've got Bailey and
Williamson and Alice Wells

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.162 align:middle line:84%
were all people that were
along on that particular drive.

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And year is the
car in the background?

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.203 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: There you go.

00:15:33.203 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was
November 20, 1952.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's two more above
George's head and another one

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
up there on the top of
the frame, as you can see.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:84%
By re-examining these
original negatives

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
with today's
technology, you start

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.725 align:middle line:84%
to see more and
more significance.

00:15:48.725 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did Project Blue Book,
which was part of the Air Force

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.140 align:middle line:10%
project to investigate UFOs,
did they investigate Adamski

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:55.940 align:middle line:10%
at all?

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.648 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: Well,
the interesting thing,

00:15:57.648 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:10%
on November 20, 1952,
at the same time

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:10%
that George was
reporting his contact,

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.700 align:middle line:10%
there was a military aircraft
on maneuvers out of the Salton

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:10%
Sea, which is just to the south
of Desert Center, in which they

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.510 align:middle line:10%
submitted a report of
an unidentified flying

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:10%
object over the Desert
Center area at the same time,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:10%
so in fact, giving legitimacy
by official recognition

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:10%
of what George had spoke
about already at that time.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ominous
dates too, November 22

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:10%
on the bottom there.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: This is one
enhanced of a Scout ship

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:84%
as it came and settled
down behind the knoll,

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.220 align:middle line:84%
in which the visitor came out
and walked down the valley.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And by examining
those photographs,

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:84%
you can see that
image of that person.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And this came out
very well when you

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:84%
consider the age of the
negatives and the film quality.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
see the next photo here.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: This is the photo
taken from the field vision

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.240 align:middle line:84%
view of the contact area and
this particular individual who

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.329 align:middle line:84%
came out and
interacted with George.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
George later had an artist
produce a painting, which

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.750 align:middle line:84%
is about 80% its likeness, full
size, which hangs in my office.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.242 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that it
resembles this to about 80%.

00:17:18.242 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that's a
photograph, not a sketch?

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: That's
a photograph.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.859 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
supposed to be an ET?

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.432 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That is.

00:17:25.432 --> 00:17:26.849 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Very
interesting looking.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Long hair,
nose, mouth, eyes, eyebrows.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How tall is that guy?

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: About 5' 7".

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.698 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do they
walk like we walk?

00:17:33.698 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They walk
just like we walked,

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of his soles.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.315 align:middle line:90%
So you can see the valley.

00:17:38.315 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
there, as he came

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
walking around the little ledge,
and came closer to George.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And when he got close to
George, he stood there.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And they squatted in the
sand there in a little bit

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.105 align:middle line:84%
of dry riverbed and made a
pictorial of the solar system

00:17:52.105 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and where he came
from and where he was.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom his shoe soles
has a series of symbols.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And those shoe soles,
like a Hammond organ,

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:04.380 align:middle line:84%
fit on particular pedals that
help control the spacecraft.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And so those shoe soles
have symbols, which

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:90%
they made a plaster cast of.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:15.912 align:middle line:84%
And there is the examination
of those symbols.

00:18:15.912 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those are
his shoe prints?

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.995 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Those
are the shoe prints.

00:18:18.995 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And those symbols in combination
with the symbols that

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:84%
were engraved on the
photographic plate

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and dropped in
George's property,

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.120 align:middle line:84%
hold the significance
for free energy device.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.495 align:middle line:84%
And those symbols
were deciphered

00:18:30.495 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:90%
by a South African engineer.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.028 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's on the
bottom of his shoes?

00:18:34.028 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Because the control
panels like a Hammond organ.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:84%
It has fingers, keys,
and it has pedals.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.242 align:middle line:84%
But they pedals on the
floor have indentations.

00:18:42.242 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So by maneuvering the
feet and the hands,

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.300 align:middle line:84%
that's how you
control the craft.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your father
did a lot of research

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.450 align:middle line:90%
about Adamski as well.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Was he trying to prove
something to himself?

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Or what was he doing?

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well my father
was a very, shall we say,

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:90%
logical, rational fellow.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Meticulous guy.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Meticulous.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And as he admitted himself,
he was very, shall we say,

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.860 align:middle line:84%
critical until it
was proven to him.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And he also said he got more
proof than he could possibly

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:90%
hope for.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:84%
He got a chance to
witness this craft.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.470 align:middle line:84%
He got a chance to
interact with George.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:84%
He got introduced to his
George's space contacts

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and continued those
relationships for many decades

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.640 align:middle line:90%
thereafter.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:33.927 align:middle line:84%
And so my father, when he
became totally convinced,

00:19:33.927 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:90%
there was no stopping him.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:90%
It was like a freight train.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Obsessed?

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Was he obsessed?

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: No, not at all.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:84%
That was not his
character, what have you.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.970 align:middle line:84%
When George handed
him his briefcase

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:84%
on George's last
birthday, about two weeks

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.813 align:middle line:84%
before he passed away, he said
I will be passing away soon.

00:19:47.813 --> 00:19:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
continue this program.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:90%
And he handed him a briefcase.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.577 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Carry the torch.

00:19:51.577 --> 00:19:52.785 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: Carry the torch.

00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:10%
And my father was
a bit appalled,

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.490 align:middle line:10%
because he was not
a public figure.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
He was not used to speaking in
front of a camera, an audience.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And so he had to develop
into it, which he did.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in '66,
we went to Europe

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.272 align:middle line:84%
and spoke all over the
place, in Linz, Austria,

00:20:09.272 --> 00:20:11.355 align:middle line:84%
where we had our first
encounter with Billy Meier.

00:20:11.355 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet that
was fascinating.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.725 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, he tried
to disrupt the lecture.

00:20:17.725 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was making
wild, yelling claims

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
of fighting aliens
and extraterrestrials

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.430 align:middle line:84%
in the caves of Switzerland
with one hand combat,

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
literally, because
he only has one hand.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember
Eckhardt Wilberts, who

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:84%
had arranged the
lecture and also was

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.100 align:middle line:84%
an editor for a major
German magazine,

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.792 align:middle line:84%
he said, well, we'll just
give this guy some space

00:20:40.792 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:90%
and let him do his own thing.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.625 align:middle line:84%
But he wasn't going
to get any traction

00:20:43.625 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:90%
during that particular time.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there was a rivalry
between Adamski and Billy

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Meier?

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.253 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: No, because
Meier didn't really

00:20:50.253 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:90%
exist at that time.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:56.520 align:middle line:84%
The Meier people tend to retro
his history as convenient,

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.753 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as
somebody comes out and says

00:20:59.753 --> 00:21:01.170 align:middle line:84%
George did this
and this and this.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
their group--

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy did
the same thing.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: All of
a sudden, he gets

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
to try to do the same thing,
which there's no evidence of.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I think,
to a great extent,

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:84%
he tried to stand
on GA's shoulders.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's really no
equivalency between them,

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
none whatsoever in message,
validity of photographs

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:90%
and films, none.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.595 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing like that.

00:21:23.595 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Your father did some
research about the moon.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.533 align:middle line:90%
What did he do?

00:21:26.533 --> 00:21:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That's correct.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:84%
In 1966, we were invited to
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:84%
before 22 scientists to
talk about the Adamski films

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:90%
and photos.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.930 align:middle line:84%
These individuals knew
how the craft worked,

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:84%
free energy propulsion,
who piloted them,

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:90%
and where they came from.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:84%
The next several months later,
Colonel Freeman did that.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Long story short, my dad
developed some contacts

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:90%
within NASA.

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And then after the
Apollo Program,

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.800 align:middle line:84%
he received directions of
where to get the microfilm

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and fiche to get the pictures
and to examine the lunar

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:84%
projects, lunar orbiters before
and then Apollo thereafter.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And in our safe, we have
15-by-11 original photographs,

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.793 align:middle line:84%
first generation
copies of the moon,

00:22:10.793 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:84%
in which you go through
thousands of these pictures.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to order
them and buy them.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can find
evidence of activity

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.450 align:middle line:84%
on the lunar surface, clouds,
mists, moving lights, moving

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.720 align:middle line:84%
vehicles, the same thing
George talked about in 1955.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.275 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did our astronauts
talk about this at all?

00:22:27.275 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Yes,
they did, absolutely.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You have updated a
book called "Alien Bases."

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.285 align:middle line:10%
And there's some photographs
and images from that.

00:22:34.285 --> 00:22:37.882 align:middle line:10%
Let's see what we're
looking at here.

00:22:37.882 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: This is
the famous Apollo 12

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:10%
with the astronaut and
the lenticular objects

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:46.040 align:middle line:10%
hanging right above his head
and illuminating the left hand

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.700 align:middle line:10%
side of his space suit.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.130 align:middle line:10%
And this was quite a
telling photograph.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:10%
In fact, many programs
have used it since.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:10%
But they have never given credit
to either the book or my father

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.290 align:middle line:10%
who wrote it and discovered it.

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now, that illumination
on the left-hand side of him

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:01.873 align:middle line:10%
was coming from what?

00:23:01.873 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: From the
object that's above him,

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.120 align:middle line:10%
because the
illumination is not--

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:10%
you have a snapshot.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do we know that's
not the side of the sun?

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.720 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: Because the sun
is not elliptical on the top.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.540 align:middle line:10%
When you look at this entire
picture in its totality,

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.470 align:middle line:10%
this entire illumination on
top is lenticular, elliptical.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:21.853 align:middle line:10%
And the sun is a round.

00:23:21.853 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is that the object?

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.603 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: That's
the object hanging

00:23:24.603 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:10%
above him, that's correct.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Apollo 12?

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:28.450 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: And
the astronauts have

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:10%
said that they were
escorted to the moon

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.270 align:middle line:10%
and also had these
craft around them

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:10%
during their
particular missions.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.583 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
flip the picture here.

00:23:40.583 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: This
is the dark side

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.472 align:middle line:84%
of the moon at that
particular time of year.

00:23:44.472 --> 00:23:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
normally that's all

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.030 align:middle line:84%
of it's black except for
the large luminescent

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:84%
object in the bottom
corner, which lights up

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:84%
the entire geographical
location, probably about

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:90%
100 miles, down below.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this is also another
craft of an Apollo shot.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Now in '66, they
already put out a study,

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.970 align:middle line:84%
the chronological
listing of lunar events,

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:13.410 align:middle line:84%
that described the same things,
objects, colored lights, miss,

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.632 align:middle line:90%
clouds, all kinds of things.

00:24:15.632 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And so we were well aware of
what was going on on the moon.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.048 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
reason we're going back.

00:24:20.048 --> 00:24:22.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lots of things
happening with Apollo 12, huh?

00:24:22.505 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, it's
every single mission.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:84%
These just happened to be
from this cadre of shots.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:84%
You see a crater here
just above the listing.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And above it is
just a smaller one.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can see material
pouring from the smaller crater,

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:84%
like out of a pitcher,
into the larger crater,

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.190 align:middle line:90%
because the moon is being mined.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
we want to go back.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:48.180 align:middle line:84%
There's trillions of dollars
worth of minerals, helium 3,

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.185 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
economical advantages

00:24:50.185 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:90%
of going to the moon.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.350 align:middle line:84%
But somebody else
has been mining

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.183 align:middle line:84%
on the moon for quite
a long time before us.

00:24:54.183 --> 00:24:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely,
and wisely so.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at our
next picture here.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.930 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: This is a very
famous shot from the 1930s

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:10%
of Gassendi Crater.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.100 align:middle line:10%
There are two Gassendis,
a greater and a minor.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.280 align:middle line:10%
And in the Gassendi greater,
you can see the construction

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:10%
of the tubular devices running
across the bottom floor

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.550 align:middle line:10%
of the crater, through the
outside of the crater rim,

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:10%
both 90 degrees and curved.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:10%
And the astronomers
said that over a period

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:10%
of several decades, they watched
the construction of these.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.825 align:middle line:10%
And then the dismantling of
some of them at the same time.

00:25:25.825 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are these little
road-like pictures, Glenn.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: These are
tubular constructions that

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
are constructed in the
bottom of Gassendi crater,

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:84%
some of them going to a
hub and then branching out.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this
is nothing more

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.330 align:middle line:84%
than the transportation of
either water, which we know

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.180 align:middle line:84%
is abundant on the moon,
or whatever materials

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.925 align:middle line:84%
that they are taking out
from that particular site.

00:25:48.925 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I believe
we have one more

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:90%
photograph to look at here.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: This is a
Lunar Orbiter four shot.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And you can see a cigar-shaped
device parked adjacent

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.365 align:middle line:90%
to the crater.

00:25:59.365 --> 00:26:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can see that
the sun is coming

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:84%
from the north, or the
top side, of the picture,

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.240 align:middle line:84%
illuminating the crater
rim and then illuminating

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:84%
the front of the
cigar-shaped craft, which

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:90%
is casting a shadow behind it.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
to the left of it?

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.232 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: That's to
the left of it, yes.

00:26:12.232 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And we have witnessed, along
with other amateur astronomers,

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.850 align:middle line:84%
crafts big enough
to totally span

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:84%
the width of the crater
Aristarchus, which

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.710 align:middle line:90%
is 30 miles in diameter.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And nature
doesn't have objects--

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: No.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --like that, does it?

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: No.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 1995, you were invited
to Maui to an observatory.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:90%
What did you do there?

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.240 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: Due
to the book, one

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.860 align:middle line:10%
of the photographers for
the Air Force facility

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:10%
that sits up in
Haleakalea read the book

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.390 align:middle line:10%
and wrote me a nice
letter and said,

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:10%
well, we have had photographs
taken of both UFOs and IFOs, so

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.100 align:middle line:10%
unidentified and
identified flying objects,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:10%
and whether, if I was
coming to Hawai'i,

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:10%
they would like to
show me the facilities.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:90%
I said, of course, yes.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And we had to get DOD
clearance from the Air Force,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.640 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, they've
known my name for decades.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.190 align:middle line:90%
And so we went up there.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.630 align:middle line:90%
They were very nice, respectful.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:90%
We took a tour.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.630 align:middle line:84%
We looked at some
of the photographs.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:10%
And so this is another
example that while there

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.540 align:middle line:10%
is a contingent
that denies, there

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:10%
is also a contingent
that silently

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.870 align:middle line:10%
likes to forward information
so that the people can

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.120 align:middle line:10%
see that and think
for themselves

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:10%
and begin to understand what
is actually going on our planet

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.800 align:middle line:10%
and off our planet.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.710 align:middle line:10%
And so as we mentioned
before, I have

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.810 align:middle line:10%
talked to a number of
officials and scientists.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I did a symposium in the
southwest about three

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:84%
or four years ago with some
very noted scientific names.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:10%
And we talked in
this gentlemen's home

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.850 align:middle line:10%
with all his colleagues
about these particular films

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.190 align:middle line:10%
and these pictures
and the reality

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial
intelligence.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your work with
Adamski and the Foundation,

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.650 align:middle line:84%
how has that been
for you personally?

00:27:55.650 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Have they put you under
a lot of criticism?

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Have you had any
backlash for yourself?

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
personally, no.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you get some critics.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And you get some
vocal opposition.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But on the whole, that is
mostly from the general public.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.450 align:middle line:84%
I think to a great extent,
I'm just a small fish

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:90%
in a very big ocean.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And considering the
direction this UFO field

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
is going in the last
several decades,

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.060 align:middle line:84%
they feel that there is no
need to bring more attention

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:84%
to George, because they're
trying so hard to keep him out

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.530 align:middle line:90%
of the loop.

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He keeps coming
back, though, doesn't he?

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, yeah, and
there's a good reason for it.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And so when you think about
the confusion and mayhem that

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.730 align:middle line:84%
exists in this particular
UFO field right now,

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:84%
they think that they have
the whole thing sewn up.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:90%
And to a great extent, they do.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Flying
Saucers Farewell"

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.800 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
books from Adamski.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.600 align:middle line:90%
He wrote that in 1961.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So he was pretty prolific
when it came to books too,

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:58.920 align:middle line:90%
wasn't he?

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.110 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: Three books
that have been published,

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:04.290 align:middle line:10%
"Flying Saucers Have Landed"
with Sir Desmond Leslie,

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.050 align:middle line:10%
who was one of the sponsors
for him for his British tour,

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.600 align:middle line:10%
along with Lord Mountbatten,
who was the brother, of course,

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:10%
of Prince Philip,
and Lord Dowden,

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.570 align:middle line:10%
who was the Chief Air
Marshal of the armed forces.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And in London, they were
all sponsors of George.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:middle line:10%
And then "Inside
the Space Ships"

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.737 align:middle line:10%
in '55 and "Flying
Saucers Farewell" in '61.

00:29:22.737 --> 00:29:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, he had some pretty
prestigious people behind him.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:10%
He went to see a Queen Juliana.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.560 align:middle line:84%
He got the gold medal
from Pope John XXIII.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But "Flying Saucers Farewell"
was his third published book,

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.740 align:middle line:84%
The fourth one we
have in archives.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.250 align:middle line:90%
It's never been published.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.010 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Is Space
War Inevitable?"

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:45.088 align:middle line:84%
But what we did is that
book came out in paperback

00:29:45.088 --> 00:29:47.130 align:middle line:84%
with the title "Behind
the Flying Saucer Mystery"

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:48.540 align:middle line:90%
in the '70s.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And we elected to republish that
book under, "Behind the Flying

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Saucer Mystery II."

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.122 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That came
out in 2015, right?

00:29:56.122 --> 00:29:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: '15.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And we added an entire section
of bringing the information up

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.190 align:middle line:90%
to date.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I wrote that, the
first 55 pages of it.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we added an entire
new illustrations section

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:84%
with photos, copies
of the letters

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.420 align:middle line:84%
that we mentioned
before, Frank Edwards

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and the scientific community
and NICAP and things like that,

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:19.800 align:middle line:84%
to give people an idea of
the legitimacy of George's

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:84%
interactions in this
particular field,

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.810 align:middle line:84%
because so much is
negatively said about him.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to say,
how did the media handle him?

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was growing
up reading about Adamski,

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.470 align:middle line:84%
it seemed to me that
they weren't handling him

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:35.630 align:middle line:90%
professionally.

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, I
think to some degree,

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.422 align:middle line:84%
this whole subject wasn't
handled professionally.

00:30:39.422 --> 00:30:41.790 align:middle line:10%
Look at Frank Edwards, a
very good book, "Flying

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.530 align:middle line:10%
Saucers-Serious Business."

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.120 align:middle line:10%
They literally ran him out
of the broadcasting field.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.850 align:middle line:10%
He lost his show, his
career, everything.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:50.617 align:middle line:10%
And then you have
Maurice Jessup.

00:30:50.617 --> 00:30:52.200 align:middle line:84%
You have so many
different individuals

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.765 align:middle line:84%
from that era that got a lot
of ridicule and some of them

00:30:57.765 --> 00:30:59.800 align:middle line:84%
some physical harm
in some respects.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Yeah,
the men in black,

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.250 align:middle line:84%
which we know was
government agents,

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.855 align:middle line:84%
came to George in the
'50s and said to him,

00:31:07.855 --> 00:31:09.230 align:middle line:84%
if you don't shut
up, we're going

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.313 align:middle line:84%
to chain you to the back
of the bumper or the car,

00:31:11.313 --> 00:31:12.520 align:middle line:90%
drag you down the mountain.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.110 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: And
George said, OK.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And then he called up
their commanding officer,

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.230 align:middle line:90%
because he knew who they were.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.660 align:middle line:10%
And he said, listen, if you
don't want this front page

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.880 align:middle line:10%
story in the San Diego newspaper
and throughout the country,

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.920 align:middle line:10%
you'll cease and desist.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.503 align:middle line:10%
And they never came
back to him again.

00:31:27.503 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
tough, wasn't he?

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
he wasn't afraid.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.530 align:middle line:10%
And he had the support of
his space contacts, which was

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:10%
worth millions of advantages.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, here's
something that

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:44.080 align:middle line:84%
is going to be overwhelming
for you, maybe emotional.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But we've got some video
of your father talking

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:90%
about George Adamski.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Yes.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.140 align:middle line:90%


00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED STECKLING:
I was interested to

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:59.160 align:middle line:84%
since 1955 in Berlin, when
I lived in my hometown,

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:84%
studying the many sightings
that appeared all over the world

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.970 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:11.580 align:middle line:84%
I have seen the
bell-shaped spacecraft

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.410 align:middle line:84%
that George Adamski has
photographed before I met him.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And that proved to me that he
was a man that spoke the truth.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I think of him as a man of
great honor and integrity,

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:25.410 align:middle line:90%
a very fine individual.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I must admit, I've never
met a person like him again.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.257 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your dad was
a good looking guy.

00:32:30.257 --> 00:32:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, he
was only 41 years old.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know
who he looks like?

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:36.162 align:middle line:84%
Pat Boone, the singer,
looks just like him.

00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: That was on
Japanese national television

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.940 align:middle line:84%
in 1977 with my
mother and my sister.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And so he became
more comfortable

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.960 align:middle line:84%
in front of a camera
as the years went by.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was pretty impressed
with George Adamski, wasn't he?

00:32:52.185 --> 00:32:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Hand in hand.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, when you see the
craft together, meet the space

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:59.310 align:middle line:84%
contacts, have it proven
to you, and afterwards

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:04.950 align:middle line:84%
have the same contacts show
you some of their devices.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:08.550 align:middle line:84%
He showed us a device that bends
light rays around an object.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:84%
They carry this like a
small cigarette lighter.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.393 align:middle line:84%
And it's using the
Einstein theory.

00:33:14.393 --> 00:33:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And your eyes only see what
is reflected back to it.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Actually, your brain
sees it, not your eyes.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.107 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your brain sees it.

00:33:19.107 --> 00:33:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so
my father said, well,

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to see this in action.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And so we were walking down
a street in Washington, DC.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.280 align:middle line:84%
This particular individual
was walking towards us

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.690 align:middle line:90%
carrying his laundry.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:33.830 align:middle line:84%
He waved, within about
10 yards, he disappeared.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He disappeared?

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:35.872 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Disappeared.

00:33:35.872 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, this means only that
your eyes don't see them,

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.020 align:middle line:84%
but they're still
physically there.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.210 align:middle line:84%
They don't go into some
imaginary dimension or anything

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:43.050 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:44.883 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In theory, you
could run into them.

00:33:44.883 --> 00:33:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And you could hear
him walking past us, his shoes.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And then as he
walked past us and we

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
turned to follow the sound,
about 3 yards behind us,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.970 align:middle line:90%
he reappeared and waved to us.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.260 align:middle line:90%
And off he walked.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And so these are some
of type of experiences

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.610 align:middle line:84%
we've been very
privileged to have.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And so when you see proof like
that, you don't doubt anymore.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, I'm
extremely honored

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:09.179 align:middle line:84%
and privileged to be
involved in this field

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and have the
background that I do

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:16.409 align:middle line:84%
and not suffer from
doubt whatsoever.

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I've had him 1,000%
evidence and proof.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems
to be that Adamski

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:24.960 align:middle line:84%
was right in the middle of
everything during this period.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.159 align:middle line:84%
Have you recalled the story of
Valiant Thor, who apparently

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:34.300 align:middle line:84%
was a space visitor from
Venus as well, who came here,

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.110 align:middle line:84%
met with Eisenhower,
and tried to convince

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.699 align:middle line:84%
our government of a better
way to live for all of us?

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.422 align:middle line:90%
Is there any validity to that?

00:34:43.422 --> 00:34:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: The
message isn't bad,

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.830 align:middle line:90%
but there's no validity to it.

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:51.420 align:middle line:84%
In the fall of '65, there
was a knock at our door.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.340 align:middle line:90%
And my father and I opened it.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And there standing in front
us was the individual who

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.100 align:middle line:90%
called himself Valiant Thor.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: My father
started to laugh.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.190 align:middle line:90%
And Val started to laugh.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And my father says,
I know who you are.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.250 align:middle line:84%
You're a misinformation agent
for the United States military,

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:09.750 align:middle line:90%
for the Pentagon.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.950 align:middle line:90%
And Val said, yeah, that's true.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:15.402 align:middle line:10%
And my father said thereafter,
he says, well, you're

00:35:15.402 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:10%
no extraterrestrial, because
I've seen enough of them

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.320 align:middle line:10%
to know the difference.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And your job is to create
mayhem and misinformation

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.353 align:middle line:90%
within the residing UFO groups.

00:35:25.353 --> 00:35:26.520 align:middle line:90%
And you're not welcome here.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, you won't get
any traction from us,

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.010 align:middle line:90%
because I know who you are.

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And Val said, OK, no problem.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.220 align:middle line:90%
And off he went.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Off he went?

00:35:33.105 --> 00:35:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Mm-hmm.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wanted to get
involved, though, in what?

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: His mission
was to go into the UFO field

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.498 align:middle line:84%
and cause as much, yes,
problems as possible.

00:35:42.498 --> 00:35:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your father
saw right through him?

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Oh, yeah.

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:47.115 align:middle line:84%
It was not difficult at
all, because we had already

00:35:47.115 --> 00:35:49.170 align:middle line:84%
been briefed about the
players at that time.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often did Adamski
meet with your parents?

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.358 align:middle line:84%
And tell me about
that relationship.

00:35:54.358 --> 00:35:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: We lived together.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.510 align:middle line:84%
When George came
to the East Coast,

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:01.740 align:middle line:84%
we all met at Madeline
Rodeffer's house,

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.240 align:middle line:90%
who had a flat in her basement.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.140 align:middle line:90%
We moved in there.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.280 align:middle line:90%
George was upstairs.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And for the entire period of
time that George was there,

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.270 align:middle line:84%
we literally lived with
the man and worked for him.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And so there was no distance
separation whatsoever.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no doubt
that your involvement

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:84%
as a little
youngster has created

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.130 align:middle line:84%
who you are today with regards
to running this foundation.

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Keeping
the message going.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I've
been well-trained.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, do you
believe in reincarnation?

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is Adamski back again?

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Not here.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not yet.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: We all come
back to different places,

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily are we
born on this planet,

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:43.000 align:middle line:84%
but we have the ability
to be advanced to others.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.290 align:middle line:84%
This planet is merely a
stepping stone, a class

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.670 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmos of learning.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And as there are
directions up the ladder,

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:84%
there are directions
down the ladder.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:56.040 align:middle line:90%
And if we do well, we progress.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.900 align:middle line:84%
If we don't do
anything, we stagnate,

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and we become born here over
and over and over again.

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And if we do really
lousy, then we

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.160 align:middle line:84%
go back down the
ladder in order to be

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.650 align:middle line:84%
able to learn what it takes
to come back up the ladder.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Television
news was in its infancy

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.580 align:middle line:90%
in those days, Glenn.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Did they give George Adamski
any kind of coverage?

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.152 align:middle line:90%
I know the newspapers did.

00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Yeah, there
are some videos of him

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:20.080 align:middle line:90%
on television.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.380 align:middle line:84%
He had some shows
that he went on.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.960 align:middle line:84%
These sections are
rather hard to find.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.480 align:middle line:84%
We have a video clip of
George on the television

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.880 align:middle line:84%
without any sound and
then a private clip

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.560 align:middle line:90%
from his private films as well.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.470 align:middle line:90%
But he was all over the place.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:40.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in January of '65,
he came back to the East Coast

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.320 align:middle line:90%
where we were.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.410 align:middle line:84%
He'd just come back from
U Thant, who offered him

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:45.300 align:middle line:90%
a seat on the United Nations.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.730 align:middle line:90%
And George turned it down.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And as we well know, U
Thant, the Secretary-General,

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:84%
was highly concerned about
UFOs and the interactions.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.010 align:middle line:90%
And he went public with it.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wasn't he the basis
of a Budd Hopkins book?

00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.967 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That I don't know.

00:37:59.967 --> 00:38:01.050 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember them all.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think he was.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Budd never revealed the name
of the United Nations head

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:07.950 align:middle line:90%
who saw UFOs in New York.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That was U Thant.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.767 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
probably U Thant.

00:38:10.767 --> 00:38:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That's right.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And then my father wrote to
prime minister Gairy of Grenada

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:18.180 align:middle line:84%
while he was in the UN, because
he was very supportive of this.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And due to that,
the three stamps

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.800 align:middle line:84%
were issued with the
Adamski UFOs on them.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.310 align:middle line:84%
But George turned down the seat
in the UN, because he said,

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:29.560 align:middle line:84%
if I take an official position,
I am then told what I can

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.360 align:middle line:90%
and cannot say.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And he says, and I
don't conduct myself--

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He won't do that.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:33.870 align:middle line:90%
How did he live?

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.390 align:middle line:90%
What did he do for a living?

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: George lectured.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.230 align:middle line:90%
And he sold the books.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Although, most of the books,
I'd say, well over half of them

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.110 align:middle line:84%
were given on contracts
to foreign nations

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.030 align:middle line:84%
in foreign language
in which he received

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:90%
no royalties whatsoever.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.700 align:middle line:90%
And so he got his pension.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:59.130 align:middle line:10%
And two of his students who were
with him since the 1930s stayed

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.600 align:middle line:10%
with him after his wife died.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And they all lived
together, three of them,

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.270 align:middle line:90%
in Lado De Loma Drive in Vista.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
helped him out a little?

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so they
helped each other out.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't make
that much money.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I think the estate
wasn't even worth $5,000

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.750 align:middle line:90%
when he passed away.

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So the claim that George got
rich is absolutely ludicrous.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.823 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
get rich with UFOs.

00:39:17.823 --> 00:39:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
you don't try to.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not--

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not the motive.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: It's not
what it's therefore.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not the motive, yeah.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with that.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Had he been alive
today, Glenn, how

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.500 align:middle line:84%
do you think the UFO community
would have received him?

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.218 align:middle line:90%


00:39:34.218 --> 00:39:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, had
he been alive today,

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:39.690 align:middle line:84%
he'd be appalled by what is
going on in the UFO community.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And the UFO community today
is just as dismissive of him

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:47.040 align:middle line:84%
as it was before, because
George stood adamantly

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:55.190 align:middle line:84%
against mysticism,
psychism, misrepresentation,

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:58.370 align:middle line:90%
theorizing over fact.

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:01.730 align:middle line:84%
He used to have an old saying,
if you don't know, shut up.

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that is basically
the witch's brew

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:11.030 align:middle line:84%
of what today's standard
UFO community is.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It is one personality
over another promoting

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.400 align:middle line:90%
themselves and not the message.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.400 align:middle line:84%
It is no accountability
for what is

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.910 align:middle line:84%
said, no accountability
for how it is said

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and how it will affect
those it's said to.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so
I watched a program

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.540 align:middle line:84%
not too long ago with this
one gentleman who is well

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.350 align:middle line:90%
known in this field these days.

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.865 align:middle line:84%
And he had the audacity to
talk about the law of karma.

00:40:39.865 --> 00:40:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And after I'd
listened to what he

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.920 align:middle line:84%
had had to say in
his lecture, he

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.710 align:middle line:84%
should be the first one
to be afraid of karma.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:46.958 align:middle line:90%
And it's sad.

00:40:46.958 --> 00:40:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What goes
around comes over.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I think it's sad,
because people don't care.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:55.090 align:middle line:90%
They throw out information.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:57.533 align:middle line:84%
And God knows, I've seen
it over the last 40 years,

00:40:57.533 --> 00:40:59.450 align:middle line:84%
going to these conferences
all over the world.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I got it.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They throw
around all kinds of innuendo

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:08.480 align:middle line:84%
with no tangible substance
or fact behind it.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And nobody holds
them accountable.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that hurt
the field of UFOlogy?

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:19.880 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, the official
debunking of UFOlogy

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.522 align:middle line:84%
is no longer done as much
by the official agencies,

00:41:23.522 --> 00:41:24.980 align:middle line:84%
because all they
have to do is look

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.440 align:middle line:90%
at the UFO community and field.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And they are doing it themselves
so much that they don't have

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.880 align:middle line:90%
to even be involved anymore.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Glenn, these
extraterrestrials

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.420 align:middle line:84%
that visited Georgia
Adamski, some

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.730 align:middle line:84%
of whom who you met,
where do they come

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.240 align:middle line:90%
from exactly, specifically?

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They came from
planets in this solar system.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the biology or what

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:50.270 align:middle line:84%
you call exobiology and
the origins of life,

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.810 align:middle line:84%
all the origins of life come
from space, the amino acids,

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.860 align:middle line:90%
the RNA, and DNA.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:59.930 align:middle line:84%
We are seeded in to
the form of life.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is surrounding us and
our planet and every planet.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.270 align:middle line:90%
And it occurs in every field.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it interesting that lately
they say, well, Mars had life,

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.570 align:middle line:84%
but it was 3 and 1/2
billion years ago?

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So according to them, Earth
life takes 3 billion years

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.040 align:middle line:84%
to evolutionize
through Darwinism,

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.220 align:middle line:84%
but they tell you the exact
opposite about other planets,

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.800 align:middle line:84%
that life was there first and
then went into eradication

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.940 align:middle line:90%
and extinction.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.950 align:middle line:90%
It's absolute nonsense.

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look at
the development of life

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and where it comes
from, you will

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:36.510 align:middle line:84%
see that it is the same
regardless of where you go.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:39.120 align:middle line:84%
We trail organic material
behind our planet

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.640 align:middle line:84%
like the rest of them do,
that's why we have meteorites

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.120 align:middle line:90%
from Mars in Antarctica.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And they have organic
material from us.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So that life will
continue to evolve.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And then George insisted, and
I have met these individual

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:54.240 align:middle line:84%
as well, and I have no reason
to doubt where they come from.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They say this is
how they come from.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.110 align:middle line:84%
They explain how
life exists there,

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and the same processes upon
which life is developed here.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And we continue to try to make
that as far reaching as can.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.050 align:middle line:84%
There is a photograph taken
by Mariner 10, I believe,

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.630 align:middle line:90%
in 1971 of Venus.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And it shows a planet
with white clouds,

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:20.190 align:middle line:84%
blue sky or ocean underneath
it, and two polar ice

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.148 align:middle line:90%
caps on each end.

00:43:21.148 --> 00:43:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nothing what they
tell us Venus is like.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.357 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They tell you
it's 800 degrees Celsius.

00:43:25.357 --> 00:43:27.270 align:middle line:84%
How in the world do you
have polar ice caps?

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And the latest pro
from Japan in 2015,

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:33.330 align:middle line:84%
also a photograph
that was supplied,

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:36.100 align:middle line:84%
shows the same type
of environment.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So I think, to a great
deal, we have one set

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.880 align:middle line:90%
= which we tell the people.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Then we have a different agenda
which goes to a select few.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the data
is very easily corruptible.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I know, flying
airplanes, if I don't

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.835 align:middle line:84%
have the proper data
programmed in my computers

00:43:56.835 --> 00:44:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and to my flight instruments,
then I get false information.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: So
all I need to do is

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:06.240 align:middle line:84%
to adjust the probe
that I sent out there

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.250 align:middle line:90%
with a ratio difference.

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:11.542 align:middle line:84%
And that broadcasts back to
JPL and these other places.

00:44:11.542 --> 00:44:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So that means that these
people aren't involved

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.380 align:middle line:90%
in any conspiracy to cover up.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.590 align:middle line:90%
They're getting the data.

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're interpreting
it as it comes through.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a calibration
differential and a calibration

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.920 align:middle line:84%
error that you know
the code to readjust,

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.950 align:middle line:84%
then you start finding out
you get different information.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:31.380 align:middle line:90%
We report 400 degrees Celsius.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.168 align:middle line:84%
The Russians report 200
degrees Celsius, right?

00:44:34.168 --> 00:44:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a big difference.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.627 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Big difference.

00:44:36.627 --> 00:44:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Now you may say 200 is high,
but if I step on a scale

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and it says 600 pounds, and
the next time it says 400,

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and I weigh 250, I know
I can't accept the data

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.320 align:middle line:90%
that it's giving to me.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's the issue.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.310 align:middle line:10%
You've been working
on a new book called

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:51.450 align:middle line:10%
"Can Truth Prevail?"

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:52.350 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:53.640 align:middle line:90%
And when can we expect that?

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.345 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
it takes some time,

00:44:56.345 --> 00:44:57.720 align:middle line:84%
because I work as
a professional,

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.790 align:middle line:90%
and I do this on spare time.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:01.410 align:middle line:84%
"Can Truth Prevail?"
has basically

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.480 align:middle line:84%
to do with my family's
history in this field

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and our experiences
throughout the decades.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I will address some of the
terrible misinformation that

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:14.640 align:middle line:84%
is perpetuated out
there, some of the things

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.490 align:middle line:84%
like they are trying to
claim the Nazis built

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:19.440 align:middle line:90%
the UFOs, which is nonsense.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.570 align:middle line:84%
If you do a little
legitimate research,

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:24.810 align:middle line:84%
you can find pictures of these
refers over European cities

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:29.460 align:middle line:84%
in 1918, which is a full 12,
13 years before the National

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Socialists even came into power.

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, if anything, the
Nazis tried to duplicate UFOs.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: That's it.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Same thing as the
Japanese and the Chinese

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:37.380 align:middle line:84%
do with our
technology, they tried

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.873 align:middle line:90%
to duplicate what they saw.

00:45:38.873 --> 00:45:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at the [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and the other crafts that were
developed by Messerschmitt,

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.130 align:middle line:90%
they were extremely unstable.

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:47.880 align:middle line:84%
They could not fly
very well, because they

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.380 align:middle line:90%
used fan rotors on the bottom.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.660 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea how
to use free energy.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.470 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
that technology.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And so in fact, I
think only one flew.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.960 align:middle line:90%
And so it was very ineffective.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And so these type of
misinformation agendas

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:07.350 align:middle line:84%
that are projected in this
field, simply because people

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:09.930 align:middle line:84%
want to remain on the
forefront of notoriety

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.180 align:middle line:84%
or have something to say
when they don't have anything

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.000 align:middle line:90%
to say.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.792 align:middle line:84%
And so they make these
kind of accusations,

00:46:14.792 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:84%
which unfortunately leads the
unknowing public into a tangent

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.340 align:middle line:90%
that is completely untrue.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I deal with that and
time travel, the Philadelphia

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:27.308 align:middle line:84%
project, all these
type of misnomers

00:46:27.308 --> 00:46:28.350 align:middle line:90%
that have occurred since.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping to
basically write one book

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and do the best I can and
set the record straight

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.540 align:middle line:90%
as much as possible.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
it's damage control.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.180 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.805 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
I don't know if it's

00:46:40.805 --> 00:46:43.950 align:middle line:84%
damage control as
much as it is trying

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.300 align:middle line:90%
to stand up for the truth.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the space people
told us specifically,

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and the best quote I ever
can remember, "Learn to love

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:54.712 align:middle line:90%
the truth above all else."

00:46:54.712 --> 00:46:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there's
nothing wrong with that.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Bassett has
been trying to talk

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.720 align:middle line:90%
about disclosure for years now.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.970 align:middle line:90%


00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:06.160 align:middle line:10%
--of the possibilities
though, if disclosure

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.860 align:middle line:10%
comes, because all
these questions

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:12.340 align:middle line:10%
that I would have would
be, are they benevolent.

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:16.280 align:middle line:10%
Are they going to trade
technology with us?

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.220 align:middle line:10%
Are they going to
visit us publicly?

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.980 align:middle line:10%
Are we going to see them
on a regular basis now?

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:22.960 align:middle line:10%
Great questions.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.830 align:middle line:10%
what could happen.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:24.280 align:middle line:10%
>>STEPHEN BASSETT:
And what's going

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.540 align:middle line:10%
to happen in the
post-disclosure world--

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.082 align:middle line:10%
this is another prediction-- is
that once the announcement is

00:47:28.082 --> 00:47:31.270 align:middle line:10%
made, the media is fully
unleashed now, of course.

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.220 align:middle line:10%
The media will
completely switch over

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.222 align:middle line:10%
to the public side, because
that's where the money is.

00:47:36.222 --> 00:47:37.430 align:middle line:10%
That's where the ratings are.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:38.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:39.700 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: You
know the idea that,

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.330 align:middle line:10%
oh, well, let's stand with the
government and help protect it.

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:43.330 align:middle line:10%
No, they're on our side.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:45.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I mean, I
will say, I told you.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:47.853 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: There'll
be a little of that.

00:47:47.853 --> 00:47:49.270 align:middle line:10%
So essentially
what you'll have is

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.645 align:middle line:10%
you'll have the government,
all its institutions, and all

00:47:51.645 --> 00:47:55.690 align:middle line:10%
of their press
representatives essentially

00:47:55.690 --> 00:48:00.910 align:middle line:10%
up against the entire American
populace and all of the media,

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:04.180 align:middle line:10%
basically saying, now,
what else do you know?

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.020 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: And it's going to
be a very intense struggle.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.215 align:middle line:10%
It's going to go on, in
which the government is

00:48:10.215 --> 00:48:12.090 align:middle line:10%
going to be trying to
limit how much they say

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:12.820 align:middle line:10%
and when they say it.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:14.778 align:middle line:10%
The public is going to
want everything at once.

00:48:14.778 --> 00:48:18.340 align:middle line:10%
But ultimately, I believe you
will have a flow of information

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:23.232 align:middle line:10%
that will slowly fill
up the truth barrel,

00:48:23.232 --> 00:48:24.940 align:middle line:10%
with certain things
withheld, ultimately.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.940 align:middle line:10%
There will be some things
withheld, indefinitely perhaps.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:29.620 align:middle line:10%
But we'll know a great deal.

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.170 align:middle line:10%
And we will be fully in
the post-disclosure world

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.068 align:middle line:10%
and a part of that
era and that time.

00:48:35.068 --> 00:48:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He said that during
an earlier "Beyond Belief"

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.160 align:middle line:90%
show, Glenn.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:38.960 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.918 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, the
answer to your questions

00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that you reiterate
in there have already

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.960 align:middle line:90%
been answered over time.

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:48.010 align:middle line:84%
But as far as
disclosure is concerned,

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:51.040 align:middle line:84%
personally, I see
it as a pipe dream.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:58.420 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you don't spend
as much energy and denial as you

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:02.290 align:middle line:84%
have during the '40s, '50s, and
'60s in order to suppress this

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:05.860 align:middle line:84%
information then
carry it through

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.740 align:middle line:84%
the '60s, '70s, and '80s
in the Space Program,

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.740 align:middle line:84%
because if you deny the
existence from the beginning,

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.330 align:middle line:84%
you cannot now go into
space and say, oh,

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:17.050 align:middle line:84%
we were wrong or we've been
telling you something else

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.217 align:middle line:90%
during this particular time.

00:49:18.217 --> 00:49:19.967 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
to keep the lie going.

00:49:19.967 --> 00:49:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: The
lie has to continue.

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going to
spend that much energy, money,

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and effort in order to
maintain the status quo of how

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:34.300 align:middle line:84%
this planet is run, its economic
system, its military system,

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.580 align:middle line:90%
and all these factors, religion.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.800 align:middle line:84%
They have spent a
lot, invested on a lot

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:43.600 align:middle line:84%
to maintain a very micromanaged
environment upon which

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.380 align:middle line:84%
the progress is usually one step
forward, two steps backwards,

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.370 align:middle line:90%
very slow.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's contained
within a nucleus of power

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:54.340 align:middle line:90%
that is very centralized.

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:57.070 align:middle line:84%
You have one world government
already for a long time.

00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:59.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's not broadcast.

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And so they are not going
to suddenly say to you,

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:04.810 align:middle line:84%
well, we've been pulling
your legs for 60 years,

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:06.830 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
give you the truth.

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And even if they did,
the greatest resistance

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.950 align:middle line:84%
would come from
the UFO community,

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:15.440 align:middle line:84%
because they've been out telling
everybody everything else.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.667 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing, it's
going to collide with them.

00:50:17.667 --> 00:50:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going to
say, you can't trust them.

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:21.160 align:middle line:90%
They lied to you for 60 years.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.930 align:middle line:90%
What they tell you now is a lie.

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're back to right
where we started before.

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:29.230 align:middle line:84%
The only way we
would unify is if we

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:33.280 align:middle line:84%
could convince the world's
population that outer space

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.130 align:middle line:90%
visitations is a threat.

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And they've been trying very
hard since 1961, the case

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.610 align:middle line:84%
study, in order to take
the UFO interactions

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and contacts divergent so that
you will be scared, horrified,

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.930 align:middle line:84%
fearing of your
life, deceptive, all

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:53.250 align:middle line:84%
these plain psychological
manipulations, basically

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.050 align:middle line:90%
psychological.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there any
truth to any of that?

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well, let's
just put it this way.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:04.270 align:middle line:84%
For all of the millennium
before, space contacts,

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.970 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you go
historically on the planet,

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and you can name every
civilization that existed,

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:12.850 align:middle line:84%
have been always of
a benevolent nature.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:14.180 align:middle line:90%
They came.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.470 align:middle line:90%
They helped us.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:16.930 align:middle line:90%
They helped reveal things to us.

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They left.

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: And left.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So when they came
to us in the 1950s,

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and George went to all the
government bodies and military

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:30.400 align:middle line:84%
bodies and religious bodies
with this information,

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and they decided not to
give it to the public,

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:36.640 align:middle line:84%
the space people started to land
amongst the general population

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.080 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, this greatly concerned that
power structure I talked to you

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:45.400 align:middle line:84%
about, because they could
not control them landing.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.640 align:middle line:84%
We have no weapon that
possibly can deter them.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.720 align:middle line:84%
They're 4,000 years ahead
of us in technology.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You better not try.

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: Well,
they aren't aggressive.

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:55.510 align:middle line:84%
We have actually shot
down some of their craft

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:56.510 align:middle line:90%
and killed some of them.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:57.730 align:middle line:90%
And they've never retaliated.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:59.313 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could
have destroyed us.

00:51:59.313 --> 00:52:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: They could have
destroyed us in a heartbeat.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And so these are the type
of interactions we had.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:07.990 align:middle line:84%
'61, we ran the
test study in order

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:10.750 align:middle line:84%
to take this divergent in
order to scare the people.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And then we have been
running with it ever since.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, that's
another issue

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that I plan to address
most vigorously.

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
there aren't abductions.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:26.260 align:middle line:84%
But they are not
extraterrestrial abductions.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:29.440 align:middle line:84%
These people are 4,000
years ahead of us.

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.940 align:middle line:84%
To travel space is a huge
technological advancement.

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.950 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea what that is.

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:37.510 align:middle line:84%
You go far enough
from this planet,

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:40.120 align:middle line:84%
you're surrounded by a
three-dimensional star field.

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.425 align:middle line:90%
Every star looks the same.

00:52:41.425 --> 00:52:42.550 align:middle line:90%
And they're not just stars.

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:45.010 align:middle line:84%
They're galaxies,
solar system, planets.

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:48.210 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know exactly
what you're doing,

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:50.370 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go
and never come back.

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And we had do it an immense
disservice to the space

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:57.060 align:middle line:84%
contacts to actually say that
they have this technology,

00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:00.120 align:middle line:84%
but they're still brutal in
their sociological development.

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:01.890 align:middle line:90%
That's absolute garbage.

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Glenn, I got to ask
you this about the Bible,

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.820 align:middle line:84%
whether you are a
biblical person or not.

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:13.350 align:middle line:84%
To me, when you read
Genesis, it sounds

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:17.250 align:middle line:84%
like an extraterrestrial
visitation, fallen angels

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:19.810 align:middle line:90%
coming down to planet Earth.

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that's what it was?

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Absolutely.

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I think the Bible, both the
Old and the New Testament,

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:28.747 align:middle line:84%
is full of records
of extraterrestrials.

00:53:28.747 --> 00:53:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
negate God, by no means.

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: No, it
in fact reinforces it.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Vatican church of
late has become very supportive

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.790 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
visitations, because they say,

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and it's rightfully said, that
it only exemplifies the greater

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:47.590 align:middle line:84%
magnificence of
the creator or God

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:50.230 align:middle line:84%
that has spread throughout
the entire cosmos.

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:51.610 align:middle line:84%
You can't look
into the Milky Way

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:53.050 align:middle line:90%
and think you're the only one.

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:56.390 align:middle line:84%
You have to be really rather
narcissistic for that.

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Foolish.

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And so
it's absolutely true.

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:04.360 align:middle line:84%
You have the flying scroll,
the flying shield, the wheel

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:08.905 align:middle line:84%
within the wheel, that you have
entertained angels unknowingly.

00:54:08.905 --> 00:54:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fatima.

00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: That's
right, Fatima.

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Another example, the Bible says
that there were giants of old.

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:21.140 align:middle line:84%
This is like giants of industry
or giants of character.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:22.920 align:middle line:84%
But some fool goes
out and says, oh, they

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.840 align:middle line:84%
must have been 20 feet
tall, because it says giant.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Another misinterpretation
that is one of the many that

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.580 align:middle line:90%
are in this field.

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But the Old Testament, the
Sanskrits, the Indian texts,

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:36.015 align:middle line:90%
the Tibetan texts--

00:54:36.015 --> 00:54:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and nobody ever
questions the fact

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:42.070 align:middle line:84%
that the Hawaiian royal
pedigree of the cape and the hat

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:45.112 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same
color design as of Tibet.

00:54:45.112 --> 00:54:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think
that comes from?

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:48.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:54:48.475 --> 00:54:51.010 align:middle line:84%
If you could change one
thing about our thoughts

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:54.430 align:middle line:84%
about UFOs and ETs,
what would that be?

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:56.020 align:middle line:90%
If you could convince us?

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I would say that
we need to educate ourselves.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we have become
more and more distracted

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and displaced from
searching, inquisitiveness,

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:13.142 align:middle line:90%
looking for ourselves.

00:55:13.142 --> 00:55:14.850 align:middle line:84%
We have become a
society where everything

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:17.520 align:middle line:84%
has to be on the plate in
front of us, on the internet

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.020 align:middle line:90%
or on our PDA.

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And as we well
know, the internet

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:24.750 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful vehicle for
presenting information and even

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.120 align:middle line:90%
more for misinformation.

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So consequently, we
have distanced ourselves

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.090 align:middle line:90%
from our desire to know.

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And if we would spend
some time wanting

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:40.420 align:middle line:84%
to know about ourselves,
like the old saying goes,

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.450 align:middle line:84%
know thyself, and you
shall know all things.

00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:47.110 align:middle line:84%
How we work, how our
molecules come together,

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:50.420 align:middle line:90%
how the elements form our form--

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:53.230 align:middle line:84%
we really sit here, and we
have no cognizance of what's

00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:55.380 align:middle line:90%
going in our own form.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:59.260 align:middle line:84%
The space people teach this
from day one of education.

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:03.820 align:middle line:84%
They are totally cognizant of
who they are, how they operate,

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.750 align:middle line:90%
where they come from.

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So there is no
ambiguity, where here, we

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:11.360 align:middle line:90%
do exactly the opposite.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:14.350 align:middle line:84%
We're more inclined
to care who wears what

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:16.620 align:middle line:90%
or how can I afford this.

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And so we are totally
disconnected from what

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I would call the natural world.

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:24.130 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean you put on a
loincloth and live in a cave.

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.220 align:middle line:84%
That means the connection
to nature, which

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.790 align:middle line:90%
is the second part of creation.

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: George Adamski
would be proud of you.

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:36.310 align:middle line:84%
He would have looked at this
little boy, Glenn Steckling

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and said, my gosh, look
what he's done now.

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:41.490 align:middle line:90%
That's got to feel good.

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:43.448 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: I don't know
if it would be pride.

00:56:43.448 --> 00:56:44.650 align:middle line:90%
I remember George.

00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:47.090 align:middle line:84%
We have a picture of my
family sitting with George.

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm writing something,
and I'm looking at him.

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And George used to always say to
me, he says, don't try, do it.

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:56.478 align:middle line:90%


00:56:56.478 --> 00:56:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You never forgot that.

00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:59.312 align:middle line:84%
>>STECKLING: And I
never forgot that.

00:56:59.312 --> 00:57:03.990 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, when
you do something well,

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:07.260 align:middle line:84%
when you do something
that you should do,

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.510 align:middle line:84%
you feel a sense
of accomplishment.

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:11.730 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of what
we have lost today.

00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:14.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't complete anything,
so there's no more sense

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:16.050 align:middle line:90%
of accomplishment in anything.

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And that builds you
up from the inside.

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:21.000 align:middle line:10%
So I don't think George
would be so much proud as he

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:26.000 align:middle line:10%
would look at me and say, you're
doing what you should be doing.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.660 align:middle line:10%
That's only natural.

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, don't stop.

00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: I won't.

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you, Glenn?

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.405 align:middle line:90%
How do they track you down.

00:57:32.405 --> 00:57:35.330 align:middle line:10%
>>STECKLING: They can reach
me on AdamskiFoundation.com.

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:37.520 align:middle line:10%
We have a website.

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.280 align:middle line:10%
We have a Facebook page,
which is George space

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:43.030 align:middle line:10%
AdamskiFoundation, one word.

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.210 align:middle line:84%
We've got quite a
few members on that.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's an open forum
for everybody to talk to.

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:49.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to police things.

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in that.

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And so they can reach me.

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:55.970 align:middle line:84%
They'll find my email on
AdamskiFoundation.com.

00:57:55.970 --> 00:58:00.153 align:middle line:84%
And we try to do the
best we very can.

00:58:00.153 --> 00:58:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
doing a great job.

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Glenn, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>STECKLING: Thank you, George.

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:06.503 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure
to interact with you.

00:58:06.503 --> 00:58:09.275 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing story,
the story of Georgia Adamski,

00:58:09.275 --> 00:58:11.150 align:middle line:10%
a person, of course,
I followed since I

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:13.670 align:middle line:10%
was a youngster,
fascinated by a guy who

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:15.630 align:middle line:10%
claimed that he went to Venus.

00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:19.270 align:middle line:84%
But you get a better perspective
now talking to Glenn Steckling.

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:20.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
