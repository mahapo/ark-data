And I think many people

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.009 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.634 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.156 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ANGELA THOMAS:
How can you tell

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.081 align:middle line:84%
if the psychic you've
chosen is real or not?

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm psychic Angela
Thomas, and I'm here

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:84%
today to discuss with
you legitimate psychics

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.400 align:middle line:90%
versus scammers.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.450 align:middle line:84%
As an advocate for the
psychic services industry,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm appalled at how many
con artists are out there,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
hiding behind the
name "psychic."

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:84%
These scammers use methods,
such as cultivating

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
fear, or techniques
such as cliffhangers,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.560 align:middle line:90%
to take your money.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
There are legitimate
psychics out there

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:84%
that are wanting
to serve others.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:84%
However, there are scammers who
are only serving themselves.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Join me today on
"Beyond Belief" where

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:84%
we will discern the difference
between legitimate psychics

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:90%
and scammers.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And so how
do you tell the difference?

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:10%
And through the
magic of television,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.440 align:middle line:10%
here is the psychic and
clairvoyant Angela Thomas.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.966 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Hello, George.

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:25.466 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We morphed you from
a little tiny television

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:10%
set to here you are.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.108 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMAS: There you go.

00:01:30.108 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.015 align:middle line:84%
How bad is the situation
with these scammers

00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:90%
that are out there?

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: You know, it's
very bad at this point.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:10%
Those type of scammers--
they're all worldwide now,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:10%
with the internet going on,
they're cropping up everywhere.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:10%
They're charging a lot of money.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:10%
They're not really offering
what they claim they can offer.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, there are
opportunists out there.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.570 align:middle line:90%
And people are falling for it.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In Los Angeles, I'll
drive up and down Ventura

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Boulevard, and I'll see these
shops that say, you know,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.407 align:middle line:90%
So and So Psychic.

00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Certainly.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or So and So Psychic.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.076 align:middle line:90%
Are those folks legit?

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Uh, the
majority are not legit.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, the majority of
professional psychics--

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:90%
they don't set up shop.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Or they won't put a
sign up in the yard.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're very professional
and they run their--

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
nominal in cost, right?

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well,
you know, the range

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:84%
is-- the cost varies,
depending on the psychic.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.054 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the
demand of the psychic.

00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does that
tell you about people?

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
What are they looking for
when they go to a psychic,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and they seem to
really be into this.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I think that people
are looking for answers.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're
looking for some insights

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:84%
from a psychic that
allows them to make

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:90%
a more informed decision.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
There are others though
that kind of give away

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:90%
their control.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And so they are looking
for information.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:90%
They're looking for hope.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:90%
They want love, jobs--

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: To change
their situation.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Love, career, everything else.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But, a professional
psychic can offer insights

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:90%
to that individual.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:84%
They can give them details
about their areas of concern.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:90%
But a scammer does not.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:84%
They might just feel the
words, and fill up the time.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So, I hate to see people
taken advantage of.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have
known some people

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.890 align:middle line:84%
who will go into some
of these psychic shops

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.134 align:middle line:84%
and totally misrepresent
who they are.

00:03:18.134 --> 00:03:18.675 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Oh!

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To the psychic.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.780 align:middle line:90%
On purpose.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.446 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right.

00:03:21.446 --> 00:03:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they may
say something about,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:84%
I need to know
about my dead uncle.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
have no dead uncle.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But the psychic goes
on and on and on,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:84%
rather than say, I'm not
feeling a dead uncle right now.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Who was he?

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you kind
of trap 'em that way.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, you know, the
legitimate psychic mediums

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.562 align:middle line:84%
would be able to
pick up on that,

00:03:45.562 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
that someone is lying
to them upfront.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But I also say that if someone
goes in with an untruth, then

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:84%
of course, you
know, that psychic

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.270 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
misinterpreting or whatever.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:84%
But a true psychic
medium would know

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that there's not an Uncle Joe,
or an Aunt Jane in spirit.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So yes, a lot of
opportunists out there.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people that
like to set up psychics.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.936 align:middle line:84%
Because these are the type
of people that are skeptics.

00:04:16.936 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And
rightfully so, right?

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some time ago I had
a psychic who has passed on--

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not going to
mention her name.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Charged a lot of money,
she did, to people.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But, she was on the air with me
one night on "Coast to Coast."

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And we had a tragedy occur
where some miners were trapped.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking about that.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:84%
At that time, an Associated
Press article popped up.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And the world was told all
miners were found alive,

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:90%
except one.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty good
news, actually.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.305 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Absolutely.

00:04:54.305 --> 00:04:55.846 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so I
asked her about it,

00:04:55.846 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and she said, yes, I
knew that would happen.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:90%
That's great news.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.413 align:middle line:90%
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.

00:04:59.413 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:90%
We'll go to a commercial break.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.280 align:middle line:84%
We come back, and they
retract the story.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:90%
They're all dead except one.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.650 align:middle line:90%
They really made a mistake.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Yet I had this
psychic saying, yeah,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.941 align:middle line:84%
I knew that would
happened, that they'd all

00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:90%
be alive-- and dah-dah-dah.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So I confronted her
on that on the air.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.450 align:middle line:90%
I said, they're all dead.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:90%
There was a mistake.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I knew that would happen.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:90%
And that was it for me.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:90%
We never used her anymore.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.043 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Certainly.

00:05:28.043 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Subsequently, she
had been on a regular TV show

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and would tell family
members of missing children,

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
you know, they're dead,
and things like that.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And then lo and behold,
15 years later, the kid

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:84%
is found alive--
you know, kidnapped

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:90%
and abducted by some lunatic.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But the family went through
this grief and this horror.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:90%
And now they're in shock.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Because their kid's alive.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.189 align:middle line:90%
That's fraud, isn't it?

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Well, you know.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It depends on
whether it's fraud.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:84%
If the psychic that you
were just sharing with me,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.917 align:middle line:90%
the information that she told--

00:06:04.917 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I bet
you know who it is,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.791 align:middle line:90%
but we won't mention who it is.

00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I do
know, but that's OK.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, was that
her intention to go,

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really psychically
getting anything.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just going to tell
George and the audience that.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people
out there that do that.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, you
know what, I have no idea.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm not getting an
impression on that.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe that psychics
should be able to be wrong.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, I teach
psychic development

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.400 align:middle line:90%
in a college setting.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And I tell those
people practicing,

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'm showing
them techniques--

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:90%
you must be willing to be wrong.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're not
willing to be wrong,

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:84%
then you are
fearful of judgment.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So the psychic that told
you about the miners,

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
or the psychic that said about
that particular missing child

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.970 align:middle line:84%
case, where he reappears
15 years later-- she

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:90%
was fearful of being judged.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So instead of saying, you
know, I'm not getting anything

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:84%
on that, or leaving it alone,
she just wanted to fill the air

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.696 align:middle line:90%
or to--

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But
maybe-- see, I think

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
a legitimate psychic
would say that.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't get this.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm right 65% of the time.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not getting
any feeling--

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I think a person who jumps
in and gives responses

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.135 align:middle line:90%
to everything may not be legit.

00:07:33.135 --> 00:07:34.315 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I agree with you.

00:07:34.315 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
been suspect, Angela,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:84%
when somebody calls in my
show about a dead person

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and the psychic on the
other end of the line

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:84%
immediately has a communication
with that dead person.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:90%
What?!

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:10%
How does that happen so fast?

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.197 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a little suspect,
too, of the scammers.

00:07:52.197 --> 00:07:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Certainly.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.594 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now how does
somebody avoid that?

00:07:56.594 --> 00:07:57.635 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Avoid scammers?

00:07:57.635 --> 00:07:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm hmm.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.856 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, number one,
you have to look at-- are they

00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:90%
cultivating fear?

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, are
they going, George,

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing this
terrible car accident.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:10%
Or, oh my goodness,
you know, I'm

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:10%
so sorry about-- I
don't think that you're

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:10%
going to have an income
for too much longer.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.135 align:middle line:84%
Anything to cause
anxiety to you.

00:08:17.135 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.093 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And then when you
ask them about more details,

00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
they'll go oh--here's the
cliffhanger they use--

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.682 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm not
getting any more on that.

00:08:25.682 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They trap you.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.223 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But, why
don't you come back

00:08:28.223 --> 00:08:29.835 align:middle line:84%
next week or next
month or whatever.

00:08:29.835 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your hour's up, right?

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Your hour is up.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:90%
I don't get any information.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:84%
But they're telling you when you
should come back and pay them

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:90%
more money.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:84%
A professional psychic is
not going to cultivate fear.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Do they speak about negatives?

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, some do.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But they're not going to go--
oh, I see a car accident,

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:90%
and to keep you anxious.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:58.020 align:middle line:84%
They also may be promising
you an item such as a crystal

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.569 align:middle line:84%
or a rock or a candle, and
say, you know what, George?

00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
solve your problems.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And for $700 for
that dollar candle--

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That crystal, yeah.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.165 align:middle line:90%
And we take credit cards.

00:09:11.165 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: We take credit cards.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
solve your problem.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Instead of, going to
a professional psychic

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:84%
who would say, this is what's
coming up in your career house,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:90%
or your money house.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Or I do see this unique
situation happening.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you making your
own decision based on that.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I
really believe, Angela,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:84%
that people are
clairvoyant, that people

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:90%
have psychic abilities.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.730 align:middle line:90%
People are intuitive.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has happened
to me time and time again.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I would not say that
I'm a psychic psychic.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
times that, you

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.730 align:middle line:84%
know, I'll send someone a text
message out of the blue, hey,

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:90%
are you OK today?

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, somebody I may
not have even communicated

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:90%
with for a month or two.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.565 align:middle line:84%
And out of the blue they say,
oh my God, dah-dah-dah just

00:09:57.565 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:90%
happened to me.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Or this or that.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.670 align:middle line:90%
I think that's intuitiveness.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that is a little
bit of being a psychic.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMAS: Well, it is.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
George, you're
absolutely correct.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I teach
psychic development,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I let those people know
everyone is psychic.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has the ability to
give some sort of message.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Or like you, had perfect timing
in sending that text message.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.140 align:middle line:84%
The thing is is
that not everyone

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.380 align:middle line:90%
believes that they are.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:90%
And nor is that everyone's path.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a passion
to pursue, how do I

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.962 align:middle line:84%
develop my ability so
that I can help others.

00:10:32.962 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
love the unknown.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:90%
They love it.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:90%
It thrives.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the reasons
my radio show continues

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:90%
to grow and grow.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:84%
People like mysteries
in areas like that.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Give me a technique,
if you can Angela,

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:84%
on what somebody should do
when they go to a psychic.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Is it word of
mouth, first of all?

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Does somebody say,
hey, Angela Thomas--

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:84%
that's the one you
want to deal with.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:58.869 align:middle line:90%
So you go to her.

00:10:58.869 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And then do they
make an appointment?

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, I mean, I'd
say that 95% of the new clients

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:84%
that come to me
are from referrals.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.210 align:middle line:84%
They may find me
from being online.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I have Angela Thomas
dot org website.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:90%
You want to make an appointment.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Because again, the legitimate
psychic has a schedule.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
They're not waiting
behind a hotline, a 1 800

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:90%
or 900 hotline.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 900, yeah.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Click.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Click.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Click.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.434 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: For, I don't
know-- $3.99 a minute,

00:11:30.434 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:90%
or $5.99 a minute.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So yes, a professional
psychic-- you always

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:84%
want to schedule
the appointment.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.009 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a psychic,
in your particular case,

00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
did this start when
you were a little girl?

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen for you?

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: You know, it
did start as a child.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't anywhere
near what I am now.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.157 align:middle line:90%
You know, as I aged--

00:11:50.157 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You developed it.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I developed more.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:90%
It came when it wanted to.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I say "it" being the
messages, or the images

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:90%
that I was seeing.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
But again, most psychics
that I've spoken to that

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.790 align:middle line:84%
have the experiences as a
child, they all thought--

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and I did, too-- this
is what everybody does.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing different.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's normal.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: It's normal.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So yes, so as I aged,
I became stronger.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:90%
And I dedicated more time to it.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.400 align:middle line:10%
And I dedicated
more time to-- so

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:10%
that I could direct
it, or be of help

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:10%
to not only myself and
family, but also to others.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Share a case
with us, if you could--

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:84%
confidential of the
person's name-- on some kind

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
of psychic involvement
you did with a client.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Oh goodness,
there's so many stories.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say that one of
the ones that stand out my mind

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:84%
is, I had a young woman that
was actually from Colorado,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
but living in Ohio
with her mother.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And she was working part time.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:00.536 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't have too much in
the bank account at the time.

00:13:00.536 --> 00:13:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And I told her
that she was going

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.260 align:middle line:84%
to be getting a car between
now and the next two months.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
know Angela, I relate

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
to everything you've
told me thus far.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, I don't
have the money to do that.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Long story short George,
she ended up with a car.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Because she was a masseuse
at a chiropractor's office--

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah ha.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And one
of the patients

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that she was with one
day said, by the way,

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.037 align:middle line:90%
do you ever take trade?

00:13:28.037 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
yes, I would take trade.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I happened
to buy a brand new vehicle.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And my old vehicle is
sitting in the driveway.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.620 align:middle line:84%
If I traded the old
vehicle, which was a Volvo,

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
would you, indeed,
do so may sessions?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.936 align:middle line:90%
And she said absolutely.

00:13:44.936 --> 00:13:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But I do have a
lot of different incidences

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of clients
that say, oh my goodness,

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:90%
you said blah, blah, blah.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And I want to look
forward to now.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been one
of the most emotional cases

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:84%
that you've handled,
where someone literally

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
breaks down right
in front of you?

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, I don't see
too many people in person

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:90%
any longer.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Most of my clients I never see.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't even see their images.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I can say that one of
my most emotional cases

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:84%
wasn't actually in
person, but rather, I

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.630 align:middle line:84%
used to volunteer to track
missing children-- stranger

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:90%
abduction cases.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was actually
a case in England

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:90%
of a 9-year old, 10-year-old.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:35.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: England?

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:36.725 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: England.

00:14:36.725 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And so, I would provide
a police format,

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:84%
all the information I
could-- street name,

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and so on, and so forth.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And I sent it forward and let
the investigators do their job.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:10%
But what was emotional was that
I knew that they had already

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.500 align:middle line:10%
been-- they were dead.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And I could vision
them lying under a tree

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:84%
with their little
hands held together.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Almost very straight like.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Laid out that way?

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Laid out that way.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I saw the-- because they
were in a field under a tree,

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:90%
I looked for a marker.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was very fortunate to
be able to see the marker.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So the emotional part was,
it wasn't as a psychic--

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:84%
because you have to stay on
the outside in order to help.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But it was
rather afterwards,

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
when I wasn't in
my psychic mode.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a mother.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And I received
the call that they

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.860 align:middle line:84%
had found the girls,
just as I had said.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And then it hit me emotionally.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And then there are very
positive situations out there.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And certainly I feel that
professional psychics

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.880 align:middle line:84%
would be able to offer
insight to say, listen,

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.655 align:middle line:90%
you may be struggling right now.

00:15:54.655 --> 00:15:58.150 align:middle line:84%
But between now and
the next three months,

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.320 align:middle line:84%
the problem that
you're going through

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
will have a resolution,
based on your decision.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
positive things that I'm

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:84%
seeing come around
the corner for you.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So people get a reading,
really, to either prepare

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:84%
for what's coming
around the corner,

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
to divert the
situation, if possible,

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:84%
or to just make a more
informed decision.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:90%
So nothing is set in stone.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.182 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you almost
like a counselor?

00:16:26.182 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I do not counsel.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You won't do it?

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I will not counsel.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe that if
people are spending money

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.385 align:middle line:84%
for a psychic reading
or a psychic session,

00:16:38.385 --> 00:16:40.695 align:middle line:84%
that they're wanting
the information.

00:16:40.695 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
They could go out and
schedule an appointment

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:90%
with a counselor.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And so going back to scammers
or opportunists or con artists,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:84%
they're-- many of them are
doing is offering their advice,

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:90%
or counseling.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Their opinion, right?

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Their
opinion or handholding.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:84%
That's not my job, not as
a professional psychic.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.970 align:middle line:84%
It's here's the information,
and it's up to you

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.141 align:middle line:90%
now to make your own decision.

00:17:05.141 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you go
through the yellow pages,

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:10.940 align:middle line:84%
under Psychics, are you going
to see in any particular city

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:90%
a whole list of people?

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: You would see a lot
of people under those listings.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And especially now
that it's worldwide,

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and we can jump on the internet,
and type psychics in, you know,

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Boulder, Colorado, or
Denver or whatever,

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see a
variety of psychic listings.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a fair price
for somebody to pay a psychic,

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:84%
so they're not
getting ripped off?

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, you
know that's like saying,

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
what's the fair price
for your doctor?

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Because depending
on the psychic,

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and depending on their
rates-- you know,

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:49.704 align:middle line:84%
I know there are psychics out
there that charge $500, $800,

00:17:49.704 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:90%
$1,000--

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A session.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: For 50 minutes.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people would
say, that is ridiculous.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But it depends on
the type of psychic.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It depends on if there
are 20,000 people lined up

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:84%
to see that psychic, so a
supply and demand situation.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:84%
One psychic may be comfortable
with charging $500.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Another psychic may say,
ooh, I can't charge 500.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:90%
So there's no really set price.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Somebody may charge $25.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.444 align:middle line:90%
But, right?

00:18:26.444 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Some people would go,
well I would never

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:90%
go see a $25 psychic.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.425 align:middle line:84%
Because people associate
price with quality.

00:18:36.425 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Angela, have
you ever seen a psychic

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:84%
or heard of a psychic that
just didn't charge any money?

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they wanted you
to buy their candles

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and their crystals, but in terms
of the psychic session-- hey,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.860 align:middle line:90%
this is free.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Absolutely.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:84%
You now, that is really
kind of baiting in one way.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And I say baiting, not
baiting for the information

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that they're giving, but
rather baiting the customer,

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.200 align:middle line:90%
saying that this is free.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to, of
course, promote my products.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Or they'll say donation only.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to donate.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.511 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pay me what you think.

00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:14.125 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Pay me what you think.

00:19:14.125 --> 00:19:15.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I kind of like that.

00:19:15.565 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, you know,
is that going to be $5, $1?

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or 100 bucks?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.095 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Is it
going to be $100?

00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to be $500?

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So, I really don't feel that
there's too many psychics

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:84%
out there that are doing
that donation type of thing.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:84%
But there are many that
say, my readings for free.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Because after all, it is
a gift, a gift from God.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.825 align:middle line:84%
And what God gives us,
we shouldn't charge for.

00:19:40.825 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: However,
parking is 50 bucks.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: However,
parking is $15.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:90%
So, absolutely.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a
few out there now.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you ever tell
somebody something horrible

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:90%
if you felt it, if you saw it?

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.659 align:middle line:90%
Like, their imminent death--

00:19:56.659 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --or
something like that?

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:90%
You won't tell them that?

00:19:59.020 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.158 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Because, number one,
you know, that is not my place.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm not God.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't determine that time.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.456 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say, I think
you need to go see your doctor.

00:20:09.456 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I do.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would do that?

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I do.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.930 align:middle line:84%
So when I am getting that
someone is ill or has

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:84%
a crisis on their hands,
or something that's

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.320 align:middle line:84%
about to become a
crisis, I then refer them

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:90%
to their medical physician.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I may say, listen,
I'm getting something

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:90%
about the area of the body.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not a physician.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend that you go,
between now and the next two

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:84%
days, or two hours, or
whatever the case may be.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
Harry Houdini was

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.730 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with trying
to find his mother.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And he went to mediums
all over the place.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:90%
He could never find one.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.832 align:middle line:90%
Always debunked them.

00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Are there some
people like that who

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.840 align:middle line:84%
are just obsessed with
debunking psychics?

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I think there
are a good many of them

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:84%
out there, you
know, who have had

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:84%
their own personal experience
with a psychic medium.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And then now, they're
passionate about exposing

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:84%
those who truly
are not a medium.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But there are wonderful
psychic mediums out there

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And then there are,
again, scammers.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who give
people a bad eye.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Who give
people a bad reputation.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:26.490 align:middle line:10%
And so, as an advocate for
the psychic services industry,

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.990 align:middle line:10%
Victoria Duff and I--
she's a financial expert--

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:33.280 align:middle line:10%
and I have teamed up
with a website called

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.600 align:middle line:10%
YourPsychicServicesBusiness.com
in hopes

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:10%
of standardizing the industry.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.462 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
like a clearinghouse?

00:21:42.462 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Not quite
like a clearinghouse.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly
there's no-- we

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:84%
don't have a staff of
individuals that can really

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.110 align:middle line:84%
do background checks and
really become involved

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:90%
with all legitimate psychics.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But we can help to point
out those who are scammers.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:84%
We can help offer
information not only

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:84%
to psychics who are
trying to show the public,

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:90%
I am a legitimate business.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.850 align:middle line:90%
I am a legitimate psychic.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But also to help
those people out there

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that are looking to say,
is he or she a scammer?

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.502 align:middle line:90%
A known scammer.

00:22:21.502 --> 00:22:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you realize
someone's out there scamming

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:84%
people, is there
anything you can do?

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, can they be licensed?

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:90%
Can you call the police?

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.539 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are they doing
anything illegal?

00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, I mean they
are doing something illegal

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
if they are
misrepresenting themselves.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:84%
But that's a very
difficult thing to prove.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you don't find too
many psychics or headlines that

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:51.345 align:middle line:84%
read "Psychic Arrested
for Crystal Whatever."

00:22:51.345 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.205 align:middle line:84%
But some have been involved
in investment scams.

00:22:55.205 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's backfired on
them in a big, big way.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Absolutely.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But here again,
very difficult to

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.520 align:middle line:84%
prosecute those
type of psychics.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's because
it's their opinion, right?

00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well,
it's their opinion

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:90%
or a matter of interpretation.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Or the psychic
gives their insights

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%
to that financial investor.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And then that financial
investor then, in turn,

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:90%
decides which way to go.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the psychic
probably qualifies it, saying,

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:90%
this is just my opinion.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:29.790 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm not--

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Or the fact that I'm
getting a clear yes or no

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:90%
about this type of investment.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't take it away
from people out there.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:84%
There are some
psychics whose forte

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.265 align:middle line:90%
is in the financial industry.

00:23:44.265 --> 00:23:45.306 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's worked.

00:23:45.306 --> 00:23:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But I have to
tell you, that's not mine.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's worked a lot.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.380 align:middle line:84%
What does this
entire field tell you

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:59.070 align:middle line:84%
about people and their need
to know about their future?

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well I think that the
need to know about your future

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.570 align:middle line:84%
is all about planning
out your life.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Now I personally go between
now and the next 18 months.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So when I do a
session, George, I

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.470 align:middle line:90%
don't say this is for your life.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like the need
is out there by individuals

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:90%
because they do have to plan.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Or they are going through
some sort of large problem.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they need to seek
a psychic that offers them

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:84%
the information that
they need, again,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.486 align:middle line:84%
to make a more
informed decision.

00:24:32.486 --> 00:24:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you like
doing what you're doing?

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.955 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I love what I do.

00:24:35.955 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a
passion for you?

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: It's a passion.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a passion, and it has
been a passion for many years.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So not only do I see
people-- not in person.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Generally, I rarely see
people in person these days.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But besides psychic sessions, I
also teach psychic development.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So my passion is to educate
the masses out there.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who likes to get
psychic readings-- men

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.140 align:middle line:90%
or women primarily?

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS:
Predominantly women do.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.854 align:middle line:84%
But I have a lot of
clients that are male.

00:25:06.854 --> 00:25:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about children?

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't
read children at all.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.215 align:middle line:84%
They must be 18 years
of age or beyond.

00:25:15.215 --> 00:25:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's do
one little one.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to put
you on the spot.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:90%
But give me a scenario using me.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:90%
How would this work?

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Do I come in to you?

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Do I ask the questions first?

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.708 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:25:26.708 --> 00:25:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well
personally, I would

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.210 align:middle line:90%
prefer not to see you in person.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you absolutely
insisted, I'd say,

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.807 align:middle line:84%
I would accommodate
George Noory, right?

00:25:35.807 --> 00:25:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But mainly you
can say, George, call me.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And I would ask you if
there's any specific questions

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:84%
or areas of concern you
wish to ask upfront.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:51.110 align:middle line:84%
After that, I need you
to sit back and listen.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Because through my own
personal experience,

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:84%
the information comes
to me very rapidly.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:01.005 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a psychic clairvoyant,
and so I'm constantly--

00:26:01.005 --> 00:26:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm highly clairaudient--
so I'm constantly

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:90%
getting that information.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And I need to tell you quickly
before it passes me by.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it always
about future events

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.330 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking
for, as individuals?

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Or do we want to talk
about the past at all?

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I personally
rarely go into the past,

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.140 align:middle line:84%
unless it's something coming
back to bite you in the bottom.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Or something that's going
to reoccur that you're

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.220 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
stop and deal with.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Why would someone pay me, or
anybody else for that matter,

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:84%
to tell them about
something they already know?

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at what's
going on now in our lives,

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:90%
and in our near future.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:84%
So again, I don't
go beyond 18 months.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.050 align:middle line:84%
I may say between now
and the next two months

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.170 align:middle line:90%
or five months or three hours.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But do you really care what's
happening 10 years from now

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:84%
when you're too busy working in
the right now, in the present?

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
an amazing field.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And are there other
countries that

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:84%
are more adept at psychic
abilities than, let's say,

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.925 align:middle line:90%
the United States?

00:27:08.925 --> 00:27:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Absolutely.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:90%
I'd say Asia is huge.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very strong.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.076 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Very strong.

00:27:14.076 --> 00:27:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Because they've had the
thousands and thousands

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:17.990 align:middle line:90%
of years, you know.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.400 align:middle line:84%
United States is the
new kid on the block.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.890 align:middle line:90%
And also Europe.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Europe is very big in
their psychic abilities.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Because, again, history.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And they've had the
time to work with it.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:36.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think as a
race-- around the world--

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:84%
we are becoming
more and more aware.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.350 align:middle line:90%
We're becoming more intuitive.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Whether we like
it or not, there's

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.992 align:middle line:84%
some people that
truly resist that.

00:27:46.992 --> 00:27:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What percent of
the psychics out there

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.370 align:middle line:90%
are scammers in your opinion?

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.815 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I would have to
say at least a good 90%.

00:27:54.815 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge!

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: It is a
huge, a huge statement.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is
that, when I say,

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:04.880 align:middle line:84%
you know-- it's not to
say there's 10% only.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But I guess we could go back
and say 85% are scammers.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And the rest are--
there's a few that

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.480 align:middle line:84%
need to work on their
abilities so that they're

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.360 align:middle line:84%
able to offer
information and details.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And the rest are
actually genuine.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.362 align:middle line:84%
You know, some people are
born with that ability.

00:28:23.362 --> 00:28:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: As we all are.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But then there are people
that develop their ability.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.180 align:middle line:90%
And they work it.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:90%
And they've dedicated to it.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And they are real, where
others are hit and miss.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:90%
They don't put any time into it.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Nor do they care.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people, it
comes easy, doesn't it?

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.145 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Absolutely.

00:28:44.145 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Others, it does not.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:46.411 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Very difficult.

00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What creates that
block for those people?

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.661 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I think it's
the way that they're

00:28:50.661 --> 00:28:51.800 align:middle line:90%
trying to interpret.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's their
own personal feelings

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.800 align:middle line:90%
about their own abilities.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Because there are psychics
that resist being psychic.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They fight it.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: They fight
it all the way.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Because they may have a cultural
background that says, no no no.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't do that.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.640 align:middle line:10%
You shouldn't have intuition.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:10%
They may have a religious
or spiritual belief

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:21.592 align:middle line:10%
that says no, I'm
treading into bad waters.

00:29:21.592 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Dangerous territory.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.120 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMAS: Dangerous
spiritual waters.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.882 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people do
fight their own abilities.

00:29:27.882 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Angela, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.256 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Thank you, George.

00:29:31.256 --> 00:29:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that's
great information.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.240 align:middle line:84%
85 to 90% of the
psychics out there

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.450 align:middle line:84%
are scammers out to
take advantage of you.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:41.990 align:middle line:90%
So be careful.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:10%
In an upcoming episode
of "Beyond Belief"

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.680 align:middle line:10%
Angela will talk about tarot
cards and what they mean.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
