>>LIONEL FRIEDBERG: I had
an exorcism from a shaman.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.172 align:middle line:84%
This man, in Swaziland,
was a shaman--

>>GEORGE NOORY: Shapeshifted?

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.672 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --of some--
yeah, but he went on all fours

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:22.300 align:middle line:84%
as though he was an animal,
as though he was a hyena.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:90%
And his eyes were blood red.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:84%
He just came along,
smelled me, detected

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:84%
what was wrong with me,
and regurgitated up--

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And taking it--

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG:
--getting rid of it.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.628 align:middle line:90%
He was absorbing it.

00:00:32.628 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yes, he was.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, welcome

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Lionel, welcome to the program.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: George, It's a
great pleasure to be here.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have heard
so many good things

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:90%
about you, my friend.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.705 align:middle line:84%
It is a pleasure to
meet you finally--

00:01:21.705 --> 00:01:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Well, thank you.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --after
all these years.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Thank you.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.447 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get started
in this kind of business?

00:01:26.447 --> 00:01:27.822 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Well,
I'll tell you.

00:01:27.822 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in South
Africa, as you said.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:10%
And I always wanted
to make movies,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:10%
ever since my mother dragged
me to my first Esther Williams

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.077 align:middle line:10%
movie when I was four years old.

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.368 align:middle line:10%
>>FRIEDBERG: And
that was my dream.

00:01:40.368 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:10%
And my passion was
to come to Hollywood.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:10%
But how to make that happen
was almost inconceivable.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Nevertheless, I grew up there.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.812 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up during
the Apartheid years.

00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:90%
It was an iniquitous system--

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tough years.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.193 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --and they were
very, very difficult years.

00:01:55.193 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Because even as a kid, one was
very, very aware of the fact

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
that this divisive society
and this way of life, there

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:84%
was something inherently
wrong with that.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.630 align:middle line:90%
And I was conscious of that.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And my father immigrated
to South Africa

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
from Europe, from Latvia,
and he was very unhappy

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:90%
about that whole situation.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:84%
When I finished my
high school, my father

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:84%
decided it's time to
leave South Africa,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
to get away from this
Apartheid situation.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was done
with that, wasn't he?

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.928 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: He
was done with that.

00:02:23.928 --> 00:02:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, he was trained as
a watchmaker in Europe.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And he took a job
in a mining town

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.155 align:middle line:84%
way up in the northern part
of Africa, sitting down

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
at the southern border
of the Belgian Congo,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:84%
in an area called
Northern Rhodesia.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And he got a job at
a new jewelry store

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.467 align:middle line:90%
there as a watchmaker.

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:43.267 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And when he
did that, I said, Dad,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming with you.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.432 align:middle line:90%
And my mother said, you're not.

00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get a university
degree and get a life.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, I
want to go up there.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd been making
movies since I was 11.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: I had a cousin who
gave me a little 8 millimeter

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:90%
camera.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And I made movies about my
buddies and birthday parties

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and sporting events
and whatever.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I had this dream of
making films about Africa--

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
"The African Queen,"
"King Solomon's

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Mines," the "Tarzan" movies.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted to do.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And here they were going up
to live in Central Africa,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.603 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, here's my chance.

00:03:16.603 --> 00:03:17.403 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look.

00:03:17.403 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:90%
How naive was that?

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, but it showed guts.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.273 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Anyway, so I
went up there with them,

00:03:22.273 --> 00:03:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't take me long to
realize that was a very, very

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:90%
bad choice.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Because what was there?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Nothing but tiny little towns
and copper mines and jungle.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.947 align:middle line:90%
Bush from horizon to horizon.

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That wasn't it for you.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:84%
You were bored out of
your mind, weren't you?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Exactly.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.620 align:middle line:90%
So what to do?

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So for the first couple
of months, I would--

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:90%
I bought myself a little car.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And I would go into the
bush and photograph old--

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:84%
in African villages
and some of the culture

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:90%
that was going on there.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
It was still very,
very traditional, other

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
than the people who worked
in the copper mines.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was wonderful,
but that wasn't a career.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And then one day
in the newspaper,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:90%
it was like manna from heaven.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I saw a little ad looking for
staff for a new television

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:90%
station.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah-ha.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.665 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Now,
this was the first TV

00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:90%
station in Central Africa.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:84%
The money came from South
Africa and from Britain.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And they were building it there
because the miners were crying

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:90%
out for entertainment at night.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:90%
They had money to burn--

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, and
there was nothing to do.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.998 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: The copper
prices were high.

00:04:21.998 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided to put
up this television station.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, it was
like manna from heaven.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So I knocked on the door
and I said, I need a job.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:90%
I'll do anything.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:90%
I'll clean the windows--

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.883 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old were you?

00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: I was
like 16, 17 years old.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, just a kid.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yeah.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd finished
high school.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me
a job in the props

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.220 align:middle line:90%
room taking care of props.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And after six months, I
said to the studio manager,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:90%
it's enough of that.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Please put me behind
one of your cameras.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And we had interesting
programming.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
We had programming for kids
in the morning in vernacular

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:90%
languages.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.828 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it was all live?

00:04:57.828 --> 00:05:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: It was all live
because there were no teachers.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:84%
There was a shortage
of teachers.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So we had live programming
for kids in the morning.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
In the afternoon we had what
was called cultural programming

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
for local tribal groups
who lived in the community,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:90%
in the area.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And we'd have people arriving
with drums and rattles

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:90%
and grass skirts.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:84%
It was this multidimensional
world of cultures.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.175 align:middle line:84%
Because at night, we had "Leave
it to Beaver" and "Bonanza"

00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.187 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you brought in some
of the United States shows, OK.

00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: At night for
the white miners, yeah.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So we had this
wonderful mixed world.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was a great
place to work.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And I got a job behind the
camera after six months

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:84%
because the studio manager
knew about my background

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.200 align:middle line:90%
as an amateur filmmaker.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.117 align:middle line:84%
And he said, all right,
get behind the camera.

00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:90%
See what you can do.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And I did, and he said,
right, we'll keep you on.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.495 align:middle line:90%
You can be a cameraman.

00:05:48.495 --> 00:05:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.085 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And that was
the start of my career.

00:05:51.085 --> 00:05:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that story.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And
I had no inkling

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:90%
as to where that would take me.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
The first three years
were absolutely wonderful.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, remember, it was 1961
when all this was happening.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I was there for
like three years.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And the British empire was
falling apart at the seams.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
All the European powers were
giving up their colonies

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:90%
in Africa.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
The Belgians had
given up the Congo.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And Britain had now started
giving up Ghana and then

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Tanganyika and Kenya.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.215 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And now it was
the turn of Northern Rhodesia

00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:84%
to become the
Republic of Zambia.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And the minute that happened,
and the local government

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:84%
took power, they
nationalized the station.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Which was understandable.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
The country belonged
to these folks.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.283 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And so it was
time for them to take over.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, the
problem for me what was--

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
you going to do?

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: --I going to do?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.447 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:06:42.447 --> 00:06:44.832 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And we had a
guy working for us at home.

00:06:44.832 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I was still living with my
folks because I couldn't afford.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:84%
They paid me a
pittance, you know?

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was a young guy.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And we had this wonderful
young man, a Bemba guy

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:90%
by the name of David Phiri.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.920 align:middle line:90%
And the next day I said to him--

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:84%
when I got the
pink slip the night

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.780 align:middle line:84%
before, all of us at the
station got a pink slip

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
from the government
to say, you've

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.220 align:middle line:84%
all done a great job,
that thank you very much--

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.553 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you, but goodbye.

00:07:09.553 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: In three
month's time, goodbye.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what am I
going to do with my life?

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Where is the road to
Hollywood from here?

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So I told this guy who
worked for us, David,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.840 align:middle line:84%
I said, David, a terrible
thing has happened.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.967 align:middle line:90%
I've been fired.

00:07:23.967 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what
are you going to do?

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.883 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I may have
to go back to South Africa.

00:07:27.883 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:90%
There is a film industry there.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And he and I used to talk
about photography a lot.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:84%
His dream was to have his own
wedding photography studio.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.705 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but I
don't really want

00:07:37.705 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:90%
to go back to South Africa.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:90%
What should I do?

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And he thought about
this, and he said,

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:90%
I'll find someone for you.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea who
he had in mind.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:84%
What would he know anyway
about a future for me?

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.577 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You found out.

00:07:50.577 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: A couple of
days later, he came along

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and he said, on
Thursday afternoon,

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
we're going into
the bush, and we're

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:84%
going to meet someone who may
have some answers for you.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, it
was the beginning

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
of an unbelievable series
of adventures and insights

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:84%
into a world that I had
no inkling of whatsoever.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Because there we were, we
were driving in my little car

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:84%
to this little
village, and he knocked

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.420 align:middle line:84%
on the door of a
little hut in there,

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and this little
old woman came up.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:84%
She was Bemba, of the
Bemba ethnic group,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and she was all hunched
up and wrinkled.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.780 align:middle line:84%
She was ancient,
spoke no English.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 90 years old probably.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yeah,
or more, or more.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but
she'd probably never

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:84%
been more than 10 miles away
from this little settlement

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:90%
where she lived.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, where
has he brought me?

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, we went inside.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And she told to David
to tell me to please

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:90%
sit down on the floor.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:90%
It was very spartan furnishing.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was a grass
mat on the floor.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.890 align:middle line:90%
And we sat down there.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And on the scratch
mat was a little bag,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:90%
a little animal skin bag.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down there, and
she looked at the bag,

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and she looked at me
and she said, to David,

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:90%
and she said, explain to him.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:84%
She said, tell him to pick
up the bag and blow into it.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Into the bag?

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yeah.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Which I did.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I picked up the
bag, I blew into it.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And then she took some snuff,
which is ground up tobacco

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.486 align:middle line:84%
leaves, and she explained
to him she said, to him,

00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:84%
this is an offering
to his ancestors.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Because his ancestors are here.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.090 align:middle line:84%
His ancestors who came before
him are going to help him today

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:90%
find his way.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's the offering
we make to them.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.640 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what--

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
watching this going,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:90%
what the heck's going on?

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.395 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --any
of this meant.

00:09:38.395 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:84%
This was like straight
out of witch doctor land.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, those serials that
I used to see at the movies?

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was amazing.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what this
held for me at all.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me, turn the
bag upside down, which I did.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And what spilled out
onto the grass mat

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
were all these little bones
and stones and little items

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.383 align:middle line:90%
like beads, glass--

00:10:01.383 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the place?

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: All over the place.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And the paradigm that these
people use-- because obviously,

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I kind of figured out that
she was a shaman of some kind,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.430 align:middle line:84%
but really not being
too sure of it at all.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:90%
But that's what she clearly was.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And the paradigm
that these people use

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
is that they use bones as
a method of communicating

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:90%
with the ancestors.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember a
movie called "The Viking"

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.320 align:middle line:90%
with Kirk Douglas.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yes!

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And some
little old lady

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
was crying out to
Odin, throwing bones.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Exactly
the same deal.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Exactly the same thing.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.708 align:middle line:90%
And the way these bones fall--

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and they have to come from
certain animals, by the way.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.320 align:middle line:84%
A lion, the hyena,
a goat, I think

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:84%
from a certain type of antelope
plus whatever else the shaman

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:90%
uses as part of his or her kit.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.123 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And she
threw these bones

00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and she leaned over like
this and she peered at them,

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and she started to try
to make sense of them.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.597 align:middle line:90%
Now, the whole--

00:11:03.597 --> 00:11:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By the way they--

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: The way they felt--

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --configured.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --the way
one bone crossed another.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:84%
It all meant something to her,
but it was more than that.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.415 align:middle line:84%
She was obviously seeing
things that I was not seeing.

00:11:14.415 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, of course not.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: She
looked at it like this

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and she suddenly
said, oh, what are

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.140 align:middle line:90%
these bright lights in my eyes?

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.822 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at David, and David
looked at me, he said to me,

00:11:23.822 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:84%
she wants to know what
these bright lights are.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
saying, what bright lights?

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.862 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: It's the
place where you work.

00:11:28.862 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly thought,
wow, she's seeing the lights

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:90%
in the television studio.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha!

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: If this
woman is seeing that,

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not seeing
that in the bones,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and she's never met
me before, I better

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.885 align:middle line:84%
listen very, very carefully
to what she has to say.

00:11:42.885 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.135 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: This
woman obviously

00:11:45.135 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:84%
has powers that I
don't understand.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And she opened up a
whole world for me.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
She basically told me
how my life would pan out

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:90%
for the next 60 years.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she was
right, wasn't she?

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.928 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: She was spot
on about everything--

00:11:57.928 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:84%
about my marriage, about
how many kids I would have.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And the strangest thing
was, that she said to me,

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.300 align:middle line:84%
don't worry because
you are going

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.470 align:middle line:84%
to go across the
very, very big water,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and you will go
into that direction.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:90%
And she pointed to the north.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.993 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what that meant.

00:12:18.993 --> 00:12:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And she made a lot
of other predictions,

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.155 align:middle line:90%
and they all came true.

00:12:22.155 --> 00:12:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you a
couple of examples.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:84%
She said, one day, you
will work in a world

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:90%
where there is no color.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.750 align:middle line:90%
It is all white.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:90%
The whole place is white.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:90%
No color at all.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:90%
You will go there for your work.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you eventually cross
the big water to the north,

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.950 align:middle line:84%
you will work in a place where
there are more big lights.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And there are very
famous people.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hollywood?

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: I wasn't making
any sense of all of this,

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
but I'm desperately trying
to make notes, as David

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:90%
was translating for me.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:84%
She said to me, you
will meet a man one

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:84%
day who knew the most
evil man who ever lived

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.780 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:84%
That scared me like
you have no idea.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: What is
she talking about?

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.737 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:03.737 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: She said you
will go, as part of your work,

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:84%
into the bush one day, and
there will be a great beast.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And you will almost
come very close to dying

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.768 align:middle line:90%
because of this beast.

00:13:13.768 --> 00:13:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And obviously
that happened?

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.852 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: What
did she talk about?

00:13:16.852 --> 00:13:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And so as the years went by,
all these things came to pass.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.863 align:middle line:84%
The great beast was an
elephant that almost killed me.

00:13:24.863 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trampled you?

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yeah,
on a safari film

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that I did with the inventor of
the Hula Hoop and the Frisbee.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.890 align:middle line:84%
He went out there on safari with
two buddies from California.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I was hired as a cameraman
to photograph the safari.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And the one guy shot at
an elephant and missed,

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.608 align:middle line:90%
and the whole herd went--

00:13:43.608 --> 00:13:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They went crazy.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: --crazy.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And there was a cow who had
a calf with her, a baby.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And when she saw
this guy with a gun,

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:84%
she came running
straight towards him.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And my shot was--

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They know.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.623 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: --right behind him.

00:13:57.623 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
He was in front of
me like this, and she

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:90%
came running towards us.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:90%
She wanted to kill him.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
He ran out of picture, and
I was rooted to the spot.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:90%
I was absolutely terrified.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.665 align:middle line:84%
Besides it was a
heavy film camera,

00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
battery attached to it.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
very, very big.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yeah.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.342 align:middle line:84%
And all I could hear were
people saying, run, run, run!

00:14:17.342 --> 00:14:19.090 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And at the very last moment, the
white guy who ran the safari,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:90%
he shot her right--

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, no.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --between her eyes,
and she died maybe 6 feet away

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:90%
from me, and saved my life.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly
realized when that

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
happened, that that woman
had foreseen that event.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:84%
As she had foreseen the
fact that I had eventually

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
left South Africa in 1966,
moved to the northern hemisphere

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:45.490 align:middle line:90%
by sea.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:90%
You went by sea those days--

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: --not by air.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was early
one night, I was

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.340 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the top
deck of the ship going

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.730 align:middle line:84%
to Southampton from
Cape Town, and the sky

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:90%
would change every night.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where you could
see every star in the sky.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yeah.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
The southern stars
were disappearing,

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and the northern stars
were making an appearance.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, it was
like, oh my god, I

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:84%
am traveling across this
planet, from south to north.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And it hit me
then-- she saw that.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.740 align:middle line:84%
This old lady
foresaw everything--

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.207 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --that
happened in my life.

00:15:18.207 --> 00:15:21.760 align:middle line:84%
The white world, by the way,
that she talked about, in 1991,

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I was on an expedition
to Antarctica doing--

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All snow, right?

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.392 align:middle line:90%
And there you go.

00:15:27.392 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Well, ice, yeah.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:90%
I was doing a show for PBS.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.680 align:middle line:90%
And I went up there one night--

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.780 align:middle line:90%
it was Christmas Eve in 1991.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.920 align:middle line:84%
The captain stopped the
ship, full of scientists.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
We were doing investigations
into global warming.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And, too, are the seas
becoming more acidic

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:90%
because of human activity?

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:84%
You can see all that
in the Antarctic.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was Christmas Eve.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:90%
The captain stopped the ship--

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.740 align:middle line:84%
party time-- and it was
in the southern hemisphere

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.440 align:middle line:84%
in December, so it was
perpetual daylight.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.907 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to go
and sit on the top deck

00:15:58.907 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:84%
after I had a couple of drinks
with the guys downstairs.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was making my notes, as I
did every night as a filmmaker.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly tried to
describe the world I was in.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm like in a
translucent, white egg--

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is what
she basically said.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: It's
nothing but white,

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly what
this lady had foreseen.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.385 align:middle line:84%
It was incredible
what this woman saw.

00:16:22.385 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it just dawned
on you-- she was right again.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.635 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Exactly.

00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
dawned on me.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect them to happen.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I only realized when they
did happen how right she was.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And it made me realize
these folks know

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:90%
more than I can understand.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're very
tuned in, somehow.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And what is the
system that they are using?

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
What is it that gives
them that power?

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:84%
What is it that gives
them that insight?

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Here is a person
with no education,

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:84%
never been anywhere in her
life, living under a thorn tree.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:90%
How does she know this stuff?

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And that, for me, was
an absolute revelation.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.108 align:middle line:84%
And I kept that thought in
mind for the rest of my life.

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what led
you to write this book?

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: That's what led
me to write this book, "Forever

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:90%
in My Veins."

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:10%
And the title
comes from the fact

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:10%
that her predictions
is it basically

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:10%
comes from an African paradigm.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And as I am from Africa,
the essence of Africa

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.310 align:middle line:84%
is very much in my
veins to this very day.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did she
predict the disease?

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: She
predicted that I would

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.640 align:middle line:90%
get very, very ill one day.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And my goodness, she was
absolutely spot on because--

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.290 align:middle line:90%
She was right about that, too.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: In
the mid '90s, I was

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with this chronic
kidney condition that

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:90%
almost killed me.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.557 align:middle line:90%
And nothing was working, either.

00:17:43.557 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was helping.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend
who was a surgeon

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:90%
living in Santa Barbara.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.132 align:middle line:84%
And he was also from South
Africa, he was my age.

00:17:54.132 --> 00:17:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me
one day, he said,

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Lionel, nothing's
working for you.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Can I make a suggestion?

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, I'm
studying the shamans of Africa,

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:90%
what they call sangomas.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Sangoma is a Zulu
word which means

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:84%
like soothsayer,
opener of the truths,

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:90%
being able to foresee things.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: I'm
studying the teachings,

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:84%
the practices of sangomas in
South Africa because I want

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:84%
to know why these medicines
that these people concoct from

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:84%
berries and roots and herbs
and whatever else in the bush--

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They work.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Work.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:90%
They actually work.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.200 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:90%
We've got big pharma here.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
How come that stuff that
they make by going out

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:90%
into the field, it works?

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm studying that.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I've got
a suggestion for you.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going out there
in a couple of months.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you come with me?

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one of those
shamans might have

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:84%
some idea as to how to help you
cure your kidney disease, which

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:48.970 align:middle line:90%
is what I had.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he saved your life.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And
that's, I think,

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.490 align:middle line:84%
what actually did
save my life was to--

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to show
you a clip of Robbie Holz.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And she talked about how
she healed herself when

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Western medicine could not.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.850 align:middle line:90%
From Gaia's "Open Minds."

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBBIE HOLZ: Most people
are not supposed to be sick.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it is part
of your soul's destiny.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I needed to go through that
to put me where I am today.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Often children
are born that way.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Babies come in
with these things.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
But most of us are not
supposed to be sick.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are just crumbling
under the emotional weight

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:90%
that we're putting them under.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's important, is that
you have the ability to heal.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.340 align:middle line:84%
More than likely you
are supposed to heal.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Know that.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Get your power back.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the fourth step of the
"Aboriginal Healing Secrets"

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:90%
is, take your power back.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.488 align:middle line:84%
If I had believed what
the doctors had told me,

00:19:35.488 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:84%
that this is incurable, you'll
have it the rest of your life,

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I probably wouldn't have
made it another 10 years.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
And nor would Gary

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.607 align:middle line:84%
have made it an extra 12
years had he believed that.

00:19:43.607 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLZ: No, no.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And now I've since
healed that hepatitis.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:84%
The doctors have tested me every
year for at least eight years,

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:50.870 align:middle line:90%
and I have not had it.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't have it, I'm cured.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:90%
So these things are doable.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:84%
It's only what they
know at the moment.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's really important
to keep that in mind.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
go back to Africa,

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.410 align:middle line:90%
and you talk to a shaman.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And what do they give
you, some potion?

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Well, she's
absolutely right what she said.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
She said the doctor sees what
the doctor sees at the moment.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.033 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: They
don't see the whole.

00:20:14.033 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
They don't see the whole
entity of who you are.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:90%
The shaman does.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.990 align:middle line:10%
The shaman has a far more
embracing perspective,

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.700 align:middle line:10%
I think, of who one is.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Whereas Western medicine
teaches you, they heal the ear,

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
they heal the eye, they heal
the nose, but not the whole.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And they don't take into account
the spiritual aspect of who you

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.630 align:middle line:90%
are, whereas the shaman does.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And the shaman also
consults the ancestors.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
in your lineage

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.680 align:middle line:84%
which may be able to be tweaked
and corrected to help you

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:90%
with your current illness?

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you
that my nephrologist in LA,

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and I had the best care in the
world, he said, in 10 years,

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.425 align:middle line:84%
you are either going
to be in dialysis

00:20:58.425 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:90%
or you're going to be dead.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.177 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And
that's 30 years ago.

00:21:02.177 --> 00:21:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And here you are today.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.843 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And it's the
African paradigm that actually

00:21:05.843 --> 00:21:07.043 align:middle line:90%
has brought me this way.

00:21:07.043 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they do for you?

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.435 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: They did a bunch
of really amazing things.

00:21:12.435 --> 00:21:18.035 align:middle line:84%
They gave me herbs and
powders in which to bathe.

00:21:18.035 --> 00:21:21.847 align:middle line:84%
I started ritual bathing once
a week with little things

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.430 align:middle line:84%
that they gave me
to put in the water.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anything to ingest?

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: They did.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.340 align:middle line:84%
While I was at their
villages, they did.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:90%
But not to bring back to LA.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
start feeling better?

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.842 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: I started feeling
very, very strange when

00:21:35.842 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:90%
this first started happening.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:84%
It was like I didn't quite
understand what was going on,

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:84%
but I knew something cathartic
was happening to my body

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
when they started
dealing with me.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But the most
extraordinary thing was

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I had an exorcism from a shaman.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:56.040 align:middle line:84%
He basically-- this man
in Swaziland was a shaman,

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:02.220 align:middle line:90%
and he became another entity.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.560 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though he took
on the being, the essence of--

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like he shapeshifted?

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.162 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --some-- yeah,
but he remained who he was.

00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:90%
But his eyes were blood red.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.040 align:middle line:84%
He was dressed in all
his tribal regalia.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.570 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely
magnificent in this mud hut.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And he went on all fours as
though he was an animal, as

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:84%
though he was a hyena,
and he came up to me

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:90%
and he smelled me.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And when he came to my kidneys,
he vomited into these--

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: --barrels.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:90%
He vomited--

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without really knowing
what was wrong with you?

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.867 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Without having a
clue what was wrong with me,

00:22:31.867 --> 00:22:35.230 align:middle line:84%
he vomited this ghastly,
yellowy, slimy stuff--

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ugh!

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.155 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --into these
barrels, as though he had

00:22:38.155 --> 00:22:40.990 align:middle line:90%
taken something out of my body.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And, again, this guy
didn't even speak English.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:84%
He just came along,
smelled me, detected

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:50.438 align:middle line:84%
what was wrong with me, and
regurgitated up this evil--

00:22:50.438 --> 00:22:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It reminds me
of "The Green Mile."

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Remember that movie?

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Exactly
like "The Green Mile."

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had stuff
coming out of him.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.542 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yeah,
exactly like that.

00:22:56.542 --> 00:23:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And, obviously,
what he was doing

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.760 align:middle line:84%
was picking up on
negative energy.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.320 align:middle line:90%
He was picking up--

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.910 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't like a traditional
exorcism, such as Linda Blair

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:90%
went through in the movie.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: He was picking
up on negative energy that was

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:13.970 align:middle line:90%
inside me--

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And taking--

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.870 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:90%
He was absorbing it.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --and
getting rid of it.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he was.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And how do these
people know this stuff?

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, this goes back
thousands of years.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:84%
These folks have been
doing it forever.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about your
TV special, "Beyond Death."

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: "Beyond
Death" was a show

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.210 align:middle line:84%
that I did for cable
television in the '90s.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And the premise was--
well, the instructions

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.860 align:middle line:84%
were no ooga booga stuff and no
haunted houses, none of that.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:90%
We want science.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.400 align:middle line:84%
You go out and find
people who really

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.822 align:middle line:84%
have had near-death experiences
and who can tell you

00:23:47.822 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:90%
about their experience.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the
science behind it.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.665 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: It was
a two-hour special.

00:23:51.665 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:84%
But in the process
of making that show,

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I met extraordinary people,
including Robert Jahn,

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.650 align:middle line:84%
who ran the Princeton
Engineering Anomalies Research

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Unit at Princeton University.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Monroe
Institute in Virginia.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.673 align:middle line:90%
These people do phenomenal work.

00:24:08.673 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was Robert
Monroe alive at that time?

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: He was not.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:90%
He'd passed on.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He died, yeah.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yeah.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's all to do
with consciousness.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was what
happens to consciousness?

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:90%
What is your consciousness?

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness
is your personality.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it your soul?

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Is it your spirit?

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it the essence of your being?

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.730 align:middle line:90%
And what is it?

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not just thoughts going
on in synapses in your brain.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's something more.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: There's
something more,

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and it does exist outside
of the physical body.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.133 align:middle line:90%
This we proved.

00:24:40.133 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you look at
reincarnation, too, Lionel?

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And we absolutely
looked at reincarnation.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to show you
a clip from Gaia's "Legacy"

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:84%
of the historical Dr.
Raymond Moody, who

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:90%
talks about reincarnation.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.463 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Great guy.

00:24:51.463 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RAYMOND MOODY: Reincarnation
was there at the beginning.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Plato was a reincarnationist
and had some very brilliant

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:84%
perceptions, I think, about
the reincarnation process.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:84%
One of them being that he
made an articulate statement

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
about why we don't
remember our past lives.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was
he formulated it

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:20.310 align:middle line:84%
in terms of an experience
that every one of us has had.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's called in
psychology an event boundary.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.140 align:middle line:84%
What an event boundary
is, is an event boundary

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the fact
that the mind puts things

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:84%
into little packets
for processing.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
out of that packet,

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:39.210 align:middle line:84%
you may not have access
to that information.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And the most common example is
that you're in the living room

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and you think of something you
want to get in the kitchen.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is as soon
as you go through the doorway

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:90%
into the kitchen, what?

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:84%
You forget what you
came in there for.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's an event
boundary, and Plato

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:84%
articulated how that is
involved in the reincarnation

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's spot-on, isn't he?

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.607 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: I think
absolutely spot-on.

00:26:06.607 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:84%
In reincarnation, there's
no question of that.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Jahn said to me, when
I'd finished interviewing him

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:84%
at Princeton
University-- and this

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:90%
is a guy who's an engineer.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And he said
we are here for a purpose,

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and we are here for
a learning purpose.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.070 align:middle line:90%
The body is purely a vehicle.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:84%
We are only here-- that this is
the method by which we learn,

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.170 align:middle line:90%
pick up these experiences.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of
it is to actually

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:84%
learn something, to improve
on the soul, on who we are.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And in reincarnation
is how we do that.

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:84%
We go from body to body to body,
as we pick up stuff as we go.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And I have no doubt
that is the case.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Africans
don't believe in that,

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.940 align:middle line:84%
but they have the
same kind of concept.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Because we talk
about the ancestors.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:84%
The ancestors are always
there and they're accessible.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hasn't
pharmaceutical companies,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
haven't they gone to
places like Africa,

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:84%
look at what the shamans
are doing, and recreate it

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.163 align:middle line:90%
and make it synthetic?

00:27:07.163 --> 00:27:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: That's
exactly right.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.163 align:middle line:84%
Where do we get most
of our medicines?

00:27:10.163 --> 00:27:11.827 align:middle line:84%
Most of our medicines
come from nature.

00:27:11.827 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And plants.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yeah.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they got--

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.962 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The aspirin came
from the willow bark.

00:27:15.962 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Precisely.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:23.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they go into
nature to find their drugs.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And by picking up the
wisdom of the local people--

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:84%
whether it's South
America or whether it's

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.951 align:middle line:84%
North American Native
Americans here,

00:27:33.951 --> 00:27:36.360 align:middle line:84%
the original folk who
lived in North America

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.100 align:middle line:90%
or back in Africa--

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.600 align:middle line:84%
they're picking on what a
wisdom that these folks already

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.695 align:middle line:90%
know about.

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what does
this tell you, Lionel,

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:49.590 align:middle line:84%
about this planet
that has on the planet

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.070 align:middle line:84%
remedies for
diseases that happen?

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's an
incredible design.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: It's amazing.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think my years
of making documentaries

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:84%
on all kinds of subjects,
working with NASA

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.465 align:middle line:84%
and doing ethnographic
filmmaking,

00:28:06.465 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and all that kind of
stuff that I've done,

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.307 align:middle line:84%
has taught me that there's more
to this world than we know.

00:28:12.307 --> 00:28:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.165 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: I mean, there's
just absolutely no question

00:28:15.165 --> 00:28:15.965 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:28:15.965 --> 00:28:18.120 align:middle line:84%
When you think about the
work of Dr. Emoto in Japan

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and his work with water, and the
fact that water molecules can

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.760 align:middle line:84%
be changed purely by
thinking about it--

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
right, bombarding it

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.355 align:middle line:84%
with nice music or
evil music, basically.

00:28:28.355 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Exactly.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more
that we don't know.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think, you talk about
big pharma, some of them

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.870 align:middle line:84%
may know about this stuff, but
they keep it to themselves,

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:37.140 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Because
they're in business,

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's good for
business to not

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:90%
make it generally available.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it's almost
like energy devices

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:84%
when you go into
the UFO community.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.540 align:middle line:84%
We may know stuff
that extraterrestrials

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.240 align:middle line:84%
have given us, but heaven
forbid that should go out

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.050 align:middle line:90%
in the mainstream.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.197 align:middle line:84%
Because we have the oil
companies to deal with,

00:28:57.197 --> 00:28:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and we have the automobile
companies to deal with,

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's not good
for business if we

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.780 align:middle line:84%
can find a way of not
polluting the Earth

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:90%
and not using fossil fuels.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's all of
this in the way.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Commercialism and
all that stuff often

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.260 align:middle line:90%
stands in the way of things.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.490 align:middle line:90%
We've done wonders.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.130 align:middle line:84%
We've done wonderful things,
and the medical fraternity

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.220 align:middle line:90%
certainly has.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But there's a little bit
of jealousy going on there.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Some things are held back
in order for their profits

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.160 align:middle line:90%
to continue to happen.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.218 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, because there's
no money in natural remedies.

00:29:30.218 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: There we go.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, if
Tesla was right,

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.450 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't be burning
fossil fuels at the moment.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: That's not good for
business for the oil companies.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When
Westinghouse backed Tesla,

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.730 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't figure out how to
make money doing it because he

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.170 align:middle line:90%
kept talking about free energy.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Exactly.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.543 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just take it
out of the atmosphere.

00:29:48.543 --> 00:29:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Exactly.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.922 align:middle line:84%
I think all of these
things are possible.

00:29:51.922 --> 00:29:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And we are capable of
so much, but we're only

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.930 align:middle line:90%
allowed to know so much.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a boundary,
there's a barrier.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's built into
the educational system.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know the
work of Dr. Joe Dispenza?

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yes.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the Gaia
program "Rewired,"

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:12.750 align:middle line:84%
he talked about how you can
change your physical body just

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.310 align:middle line:90%
by thinking positive.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.525 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Absolutely.

00:30:16.525 --> 00:30:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE DISPENZA:
People are living

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.450 align:middle line:84%
in the routine of the
predictable future,

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:84%
or they're memorized to
emotions of their past,

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and they can't think or act
greater than how they feel.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Then those series of
events in their lives

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.720 align:middle line:84%
has began to influence
their gene expression.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Then once the gene
has been signaled,

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and the person is
constantly living out

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:42.050 align:middle line:84%
of homeostasis or
balance, that imbalance

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:90%
becomes their new balance.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And now the internal
environment of their body

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.070 align:middle line:84%
is sending specific
signals to the cells,

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and the cells are getting
the same instructions.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And the same instructions
produce the same proteins.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And now the person begins
to experience ill health

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:90%
or disease.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So I became very
interested in this topic

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:08.450 align:middle line:84%
because I started reading
research where scientists

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:84%
were taking people that
had Type 2 diabetes

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:15.720 align:middle line:84%
and exposing them to
an hour of comedy.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And when they rated the comedy
show, many of the participants

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:84%
rated the show on
a scale of 1 to 5.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:84%
A 5, which means for a whole
entire hour they laughed.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.460 align:middle line:84%
But what they were measuring
before and after the comedy

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:90%
show caught my attention.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
measuring gene expression

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:39.530 align:middle line:84%
to see if changing
their emotional state

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:43.650 align:middle line:84%
was able to, in one hour,
select and instruct new genes.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, over 20
genes were upregulated just

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.210 align:middle line:90%
by people changing their mood.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So by changing their
internal state,

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.700 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
select and instruct

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.010 align:middle line:84%
new genes that
made new proteins.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:84%
People began to function with
diabetes within a normal range

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:04.970 align:middle line:84%
or slightly elevated
blood sugar levels

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.530 align:middle line:84%
compared to where
their blood sugar

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.747 align:middle line:90%
levels were every single day.

00:32:08.747 --> 00:32:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think Dr.
Joe's right on, Lionel.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: I think
he's absolutely

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:90%
spot-on with all of that.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.725 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, there's no
question about that.

00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:19.280 align:middle line:84%
It's all to do-- and
the mind over matter,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.848 align:middle line:90%
we can change ourselves.

00:32:20.848 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think that's what
you did to yourself in addition

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.218 align:middle line:90%
to the help they give you.

00:32:26.218 --> 00:32:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: With some help from
some very, very wise people.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
wisest people I know

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:34.580 align:middle line:84%
live on mountaintops and out
in the middle of the boondocks,

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.340 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily from
academic institutions.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I've learned so much from people
like that, that I have exactly,

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.530 align:middle line:84%
probably reconfigured
my own body

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.900 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's helped me
to cope with my illness.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think--

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.033 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: It's extraordinary.

00:32:51.033 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --the fact that he
got sick and vomited out energy

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.350 align:middle line:90%
that he was picking up from you.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yeah, there's
no doubt about that.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.890 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you something.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And another interesting
thing, I mentioned earlier

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.375 align:middle line:90%
about that elephant that--

00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it knew.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.510 align:middle line:90%
It knew what was happening.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: That elephant,
when that incident happened,

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I felt a very, very
strange thing happen to me.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.600 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though
the soul of that elephant

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and my own consciousness, if
you like, melded together.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Because every time
I went to a shaman

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and they threw the bones
for me, they always said--

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen about 30,
40 different shamans

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.413 align:middle line:90%
in my life, sangomas.

00:33:33.413 --> 00:33:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:35.747 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: They
throw the bones,

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and the very first thing they
say is, you have protection.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:40.690 align:middle line:84%
There is something
protecting you.

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Why is there an
elephant around you--

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: --all the time?

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.133 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
would they know this?

00:33:46.133 --> 00:33:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Exactly.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:51.520 align:middle line:84%
The essence of that being is
around me and protecting me,

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
wisdom of the few.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why you?

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: I
don't know, George.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.720 align:middle line:84%
I have an affinity with
the non-human world.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the reasons
that I think that I'm here

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.010 align:middle line:84%
is one of the lessons
I think I have

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.310 align:middle line:84%
to learn in this lifetime
is one of compassion.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:16.330 align:middle line:84%
We need to get on a little
better with our fellow beings

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:17.560 align:middle line:90%
than we do at the moment.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: The way we
treat the animal kingdom,

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.050 align:middle line:90%
for example--

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's horrible.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.275 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --is
absolutely atrocious.

00:34:22.275 --> 00:34:24.040 align:middle line:90%
And it disturbs me deeply.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And I have that
connection with the animal

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.179 align:middle line:90%
kingdom all the time.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Did she know that,
that elephant?

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Is that what inspired
me to feel this way?

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.469 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the fact that she
charged the guy with the rifle

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:84%
tells me it knew
that it was in danger

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.437 align:middle line:90%
and tried to protect her baby.

00:34:44.437 --> 00:34:45.354 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Her baby.

00:34:45.354 --> 00:34:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Her baby was in danger, yes.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And when she was shot,
she knew that I was not

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.600 align:middle line:84%
the one responsible
for trying to kill her.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.830 align:middle line:90%
It was the other guy.

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:58.390 align:middle line:84%
But she was shot in front of
me, and she has been with me

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.480 align:middle line:90%
ever since as a protector.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.280 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I have elephants
all over my office.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.610 align:middle line:84%
It hangs from my rearview
mirror in my car.

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:05.410 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's something.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: Yeah.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, the spirit world
is something that I really

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:14.440 align:middle line:90%
think we know so little about.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.350 align:middle line:84%
There is a whole realm, a
whole universe out there

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:21.220 align:middle line:84%
that we are blind to or not
sufficiently conscious of.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you a
really interesting event

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.600 align:middle line:90%
that happened.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.390 align:middle line:84%
When I was doing a series
called "The Tribal Identity"

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:84%
for television
back in the '70s--

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.185 align:middle line:84%
it was an ethnographic
series on all the tribes

00:35:33.185 --> 00:35:33.985 align:middle line:90%
of Southern Africa.

00:35:33.985 --> 00:35:35.610 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely fascinating.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I met a number
of other sangomas, many, many

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:84%
of them, and lived with people
going through initiation

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:44.770 align:middle line:90%
rites in the bush.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:45.890 align:middle line:90%
It was extraordinary.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:47.590 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing experience.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of the events
that we had to cover

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:53.200 align:middle line:84%
was an offering
to what was called

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:57.490 align:middle line:84%
the great spirit of the
Venda tribe in South Africa.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:84%
They live right up on the
northern boundary near Zimbabwe

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.400 align:middle line:90%
near the Limpopo River.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.840 align:middle line:90%
They are wonderful people.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
wonderful tradition.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:07.960 align:middle line:90%
They have a wonderful culture.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.400 align:middle line:90%
They have wonderful music.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And they have a profound
spiritual belief.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And once every five years,
they make an offering

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.410 align:middle line:84%
to the great spirit of the
tribe to keep the tribe safe,

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:18.640 align:middle line:90%
to keep the people safe.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And it fell into the
timeline of our production.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And so we went
up there to cover this event.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And the old guy who
arrived to do the ceremony,

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:90%
he was absolutely ancient.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:34.030 align:middle line:84%
He must have been about
a hundred years old.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And he came down to the lake.

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
number of other people

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.480 align:middle line:84%
from the tribal area
who came all dressed

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.128 align:middle line:84%
in their tribal regalia,
beads, and grass

00:36:42.128 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:90%
skirts and whatever else.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:47.190 align:middle line:84%
But this old priest
arrived to do the offering

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.640 align:middle line:90%
to the ancestor.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And I had a host,
who was a white guy,

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:84%
he was an anthropologist
presenting the series,

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.410 align:middle line:90%
a man called Peter Becker.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.490 align:middle line:90%
A wonderful guy.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And when we got
down to the lake,

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.150 align:middle line:84%
it was regarded as
sacred territory,

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:02.070 align:middle line:90%
we had to take off our shoes.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Remember what it
says in the Bible,

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.030 align:middle line:84%
take over thy feet from
the land upon which

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.470 align:middle line:90%
thy stand as it's holy ground?

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: You know, the
Hindus take off their shoes,

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.400 align:middle line:84%
the Muslims take
off their shoes.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.322 align:middle line:84%
It's a tradition in
so many cultures.

00:37:14.322 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take it
off in your house.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: In your
house, too, yeah.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And so these people said,
take off your shoes, please.

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.700 align:middle line:90%
You're on holy ground here.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Which we did.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.113 align:middle line:84%
And my host, Peter Becker,
took off his shoes as well.

00:37:25.113 --> 00:37:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to be
in front of the camera,

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and the old priest in the
background over there.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So I had the shot of
Peter here, the old priest

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.810 align:middle line:84%
in the background, and
the sacred lake shimmering

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:35.610 align:middle line:90%
over there.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And Peter was going to
explain what this old man was

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.830 align:middle line:84%
doing as he was doing
these incantations

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.210 align:middle line:90%
and chanting to the lake.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But he stubbed his toe on a rock
and he went, ouch, ouch, ouch.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And the sound man
started giggling.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.327 align:middle line:84%
And then the assistant
guy started giggling.

00:37:51.327 --> 00:37:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know what it's like when
you start, when that happens.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's infectious.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.477 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: It's
infectious, it spread.

00:37:56.477 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So we all started kind
of stifling our laughter.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.020 align:middle line:90%
It was funny.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And the old priest could
not hear any of this.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.980 align:middle line:90%
He was like 30 feet away.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Now, that was bad behavior.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And the old priest
was going like this,

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.830 align:middle line:84%
making his incantations
to the lake.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And the minute we started
laughing, his hands dropped--

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He thought you
were laughing at him.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --he turned
around, and he looked at us,

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and at that very moment,
the camera stopped running--

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.492 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --the Nagra tape
recorder stopped running.

00:38:25.492 --> 00:38:27.250 align:middle line:90%
There was no power in anything.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.200 align:middle line:90%
It was like we had a blockage.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.122 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He shut it down.

00:38:31.122 --> 00:38:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And so
I said to our fixer--

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:35.500 align:middle line:84%
we had a guy there called a
fixer, you know the guy who

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.510 align:middle line:90%
fixes things up for you?

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:37.343 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:38:37.343 --> 00:38:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: I said, please
go and ask him if you could,

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.357 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, could
he stop until we fix--

00:38:42.357 --> 00:38:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get things going again.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:45.023 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: --the problem here.

00:38:45.023 --> 00:38:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So he went to the
priest and he said,

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.410 align:middle line:84%
these guys, the film crew,
would like you to please wait.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.640 align:middle line:90%
And the old man--

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and he was old, he was
like a hundred years old--

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.670 align:middle line:84%
he said, no, they have
offended the ancestors.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And
the ancestors do not

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.000 align:middle line:84%
want them to photograph
them because they are not

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.260 align:middle line:90%
behaving properly.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.140 align:middle line:10%
And they have blocked--

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:10%
they cannot do it because
of them, the ancestors.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.600 align:middle line:10%
And I said, you are kidding me.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A fascinating story.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: And Peter
and I looked at each other

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.142 align:middle line:84%
and we said, there's more
going on here than we know.

00:39:14.142 --> 00:39:15.850 align:middle line:10%
There's something
very, very supernatural

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:17.240 align:middle line:10%
happening here at the moment.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.230 align:middle line:10%
Please offer our apologies
to the ancestors.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:22.750 align:middle line:90%
We did not mean to offend them.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And the fixer went back
to the priest and said,

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.770 align:middle line:90%
these guys are very, very sorry.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And the old man just nodded
like this, turned around,

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.180 align:middle line:84%
held up his hands, and started
his incantations again.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, needless
to say, at that moment,

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:39.707 align:middle line:84%
the camera starts running
again, the sound--

00:39:39.707 --> 00:39:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: --system
starts running again.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.570 align:middle line:90%
There's power in the mics again.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything's back
to working order.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.770 align:middle line:84%
We were blocked by some
kind of supernatural force.

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's real.

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FRIEDBERG: It is real.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.522 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely real.

00:39:52.522 --> 00:39:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lionel, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FRIEDBERG: Thank you,
George, it's been a pleasure.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is
an amazing person

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.820 align:middle line:10%
who has been into
the African grounds

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:10%
and has seen the other side
through the eyes of a shaman.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.590 align:middle line:10%
It's remarkable.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.420 align:middle line:10%
It saved his own life.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.490 align:middle line:90%
