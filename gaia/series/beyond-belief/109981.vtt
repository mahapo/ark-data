Deorr since Friday afternoon.

>>JESSICA MITCHELL: We
didn't hear people around us.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.740 align:middle line:90%
We didn't see anybody.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DEORR KUNZ, SR.: Because
it's such a small area.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.790 align:middle line:84%
That's what a lot of people,
they don't understand.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.206 align:middle line:84%
They assume, how could you let
your kid out of your sight?

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:19.040 align:middle line:84%
This area is pretty
well blocked in,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and you can see-- there's no
way you couldn't not see them.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REPORTER: Crews in the air, on
ATVs, on horseback, and on foot

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.647 align:middle line:90%
have been searching for Deorr.

00:00:27.647 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCHELL: This is his blanket.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.434 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't go anywhere
without his blanket, his cup,

00:00:32.434 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
or his monkey, and
all three of them

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.152 align:middle line:90%
were left at the campground.

>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.568 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%

all the information.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.825 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:57.011 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:10%
And in our last program
with David Paulides,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:10%
the researcher and author, one
of his books, "Missing 411,"

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.010 align:middle line:10%
we talked about people who have
just vanished, disappeared.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Yes, a few of them have
been found dead, as well,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:84%
but it's a riveting,
shocking story.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
tell you, David, I'm

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:84%
not sure I would want to take my
family through a national park

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.255 align:middle line:84%
after talking to you and
reading "Missing 411."

00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID PAULIDES:
You know, George, one

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.830 align:middle line:84%
of the things that I do
when I talk to groups

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.230 align:middle line:84%
is I tell them I'm a big
advocate of the National Park

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.120 align:middle line:90%
System.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:10%
I go all the time, but there's
a couple things I won't do.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:10%
I won't go alone, and I
always carry a firearm.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I always carry a
personal transponder.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you're taking kids,
keep your kids in front of you,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and always keep them in sight.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.428 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good
insight, now, we just

00:01:45.428 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:84%
saw a clip of a horrible
situation in Idaho

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:84%
where a family has lost in the
park system their two-year-old.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.577 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
more about what we know.

00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:10%
>>PAULIDES: So this family, the
last name was the Kunz family,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:10%
they were camping in a rural
area in a US National Forest.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.256 align:middle line:84%
And the husband and
the wife thought

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that they were leaving
the two-year-old

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
with the grandparents, and they
were going to go for a hike.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:84%
The grandmother said that
literally she turned around,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and the boy was
gone, two years old.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a creek
that runs nearby.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:84%
The sheriff came in,
and he said a couple

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:84%
of times he was 100% positive
the boy wasn't in the creek.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was not in the creek.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: They searched
it, walked up and down it.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, nearby,
there's a reservoir.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
They've searched the
reservoir three times

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.500 align:middle line:84%
with divers and
sonar, et cetera.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they
think at this point.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's an unusual
situation because there's

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.130 align:middle line:84%
a steep valley that surrounds
this reservoir and camping

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
area, and I do believe
that the searchers don't

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:84%
think that the boy could
get outside that valley.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.845 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not to
say it can't happen.

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've
both been parents.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:84%
We know what it's like
to watch little kids.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:90%
They're fast.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: They are
very fast, but there

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.530 align:middle line:84%
are some stories
in the books that

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:84%
talk about a small
two-year-old that disappears

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:84%
in an area east of
Bridgeport, California,

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:90%
in the Eastern Sierras.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:84%
This was in the late 1950s, and
the boy, almost exact scenario

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
as this one, except this
boy disappeared almost

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of his parents.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.899 align:middle line:84%
And what happened,
searchers came in.

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:90%
They said he's not in the lake.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:90%
He's not in the valley.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.290 align:middle line:84%
That meant there's only one
place to go, and that's up.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.812 align:middle line:84%
And this is a straight up wall
with a series a switchbacks.

00:03:42.812 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you stand
on the switchback,

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.365 align:middle line:84%
you would look down in the
valley and see the campsite

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:90%
and see everything.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And they brought in
some Marines that

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.760 align:middle line:84%
were at high-altitude,
low-temperature training

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:84%
in the Eastern Sierras, and
a couple of these Marines

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
just took off on a
hunch on their own.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
3,000 feet above
the valley floor,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:84%
over one mountain, down
a valley, and up another

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and in a boulder
area, they found

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:90%
this boy naked, deceased--

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.892 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: --five days later.

00:04:12.892 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, every Search
and Rescue person

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to off the record
said there's no way that boy--

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.384 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He couldn't
get up there on his own.

00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: That's
my personal feelings.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
ever find his clothes?

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.872 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Not that was
in any report I read.

00:04:27.872 --> 00:04:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.288 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Very.

00:04:29.288 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's something
else going on here.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well,
in the last couple

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.090 align:middle line:84%
weeks, last couple months, we've
been in several national parks.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And we sit back,
and we're filming,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and people don't really
know what we're filming.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:84%
But you watch the families
with these young kids,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and I think they enter
the park with the belief

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:90%
that it's Yogi the Bear.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:90%
This is solitude.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:90%
It's serenity, no dangers here.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately,
the truth behind

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
that is 99.9% of the time,
it's probably totally true.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:84%
But every once in a
while, something very,

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:84%
very bizarre and
strange happens,

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and these people disappear
and aren't found.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking just
on very rural trails.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about on some of
the main trails inside the park.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a man named
George Penca disappeared

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.922 align:middle line:84%
on one of the biggest trails
in Yosemite two years ago,

00:05:23.922 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and I know some of the people
that were involved with that.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there's
no way that guy

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:90%
could have disappeared.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:84%
He was a robust man,
not in terrific shape.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't going to go
anywhere off the trail.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.140 align:middle line:84%
He vanished, and to this
day, they've never found him.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So I think it can happen
very, very quickly,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and I can just only imagine the
grief that some of the parents

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:84%
would have felt. And,
again, interviewing

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.444 align:middle line:84%
some of those parents in
the last couple months,

00:05:48.444 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:90%
that grief never leaves you.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It doesn't leave you.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But you would think that you
would hear screams, yells,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:90%
help me, none of that.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: No, every
once in a while,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.562 align:middle line:90%
there will be a small shriek.

00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:84%
But, again, a lot of times, it
can't be attributed directly

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.630 align:middle line:90%
to the victim.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.588 align:middle line:84%
It's just something that
happens in conjunction

00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
with the disappearance,
and sometimes it's

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.670 align:middle line:84%
not even in that exact area that
they believed that their son

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.749 align:middle line:90%
or daughter was in.

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not even sure
if it's related,

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:90%
but they report it sometimes.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this
story scare you?

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.869 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've been uncovering
it for a number of years now.

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So I can say
that my own behavior has

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:90%
changed just a little.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Like, I will not go
in the woods alone.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.927 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because of this story
that you've been uncovering?

00:06:37.927 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Correct.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: I will always
carry a personal transponder.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people, I
don't care who you are.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.597 align:middle line:84%
And I know Les Stroud,
Survivorman, personally,

00:06:50.597 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think he
would go into the woods

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.390 align:middle line:90%
without a personal transponder.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So I can say that it's a
foolish thing not to do that.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.490 align:middle line:84%
If you can't afford one, almost
every sporting goods outdoor

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.100 align:middle line:84%
store will rent one to
you for $5 to $10 a day.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.167 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's smart.

00:07:06.167 --> 00:07:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: So carry that.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:84%
If you're proficient with a
firearm, I always carry a gun.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Carry that.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And always tell a
close friend where

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.890 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go in, when
you're going to come out.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not out by a
certain day, you tell them.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what's
happening to me, based

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.494 align:middle line:84%
on what I've read
with your book,

00:07:23.494 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:84%
"Missing 411" and stories
we've talked about on "Coast

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
to Coast" is that there's no
gun involved by an individual.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Somebody would have heard it.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
If you shoot off a .44
caliber or a rifle,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:84%
somebody's going to
hear that, especially

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:90%
echoing through a park.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.650 align:middle line:90%
That's not being done, is that?

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.487 align:middle line:84%
Have we heard any cases of
gunshots in the background?

00:07:48.487 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Not that
I can recall, no.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, if the individual
has a gun, you don't hear that,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:84%
trying to protect themselves,
trying to shoot at something.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.067 align:middle line:90%
It happens like that.

00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: It does.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, in preface to that
statement that you just

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:84%
made, a lot of the times the
hunters that disappeared,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.270 align:middle line:90%
they're always alone.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
the gunshot would

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:84%
be heard if it was
a defense shot,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:84%
but more hunters on the
bow-hunting side of the fence

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.660 align:middle line:84%
than the firearms side
of the defense disappear,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:84%
meaning for some reason
bow hunting seems to be

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:90%
a more dangerous thing to do.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, these aren't
predator attacks,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:84%
meaning bear, mountain
lion, et cetera.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And at the times where
their clothing is found,

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:90%
there's no evidence of that.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'd
be torn to shreds.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: There
would be evidence.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A bear doesn't
conveniently unbutton you.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.411 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: No, or roll up your
belt buckle or fold your pants.

00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And put your
shoes by your pants, yeah.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Exactly.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.038 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That doesn't happen.

00:08:53.038 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: No, so there
are those instances where

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.090 align:middle line:90%
remains are found.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.210 align:middle line:84%
There was a case here
in Northern Colorado.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
A boy named Jaryd
Atadero disappeared.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:84%
His dad told a group
of singles people

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
that they could take his son to
the fish hatchery a mile away.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And unbeknownst
to the dad, Allyn,

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.557 align:middle line:84%
this group of young
adults decided

00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that they were going to go walk
a trail and never told the dad

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and took Jocelyn and Jaryd
on this walk up this trail.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:90%
They were single people.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.810 align:middle line:84%
They didn't that you're supposed
to watch kids real close.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Jaryd ran ahead of
the group, walked up,

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.360 align:middle line:90%
and saw a couple fisherman.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And Jaryd asked the fishermen,
are there any bear around here?

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And the fishermen
got upset and said,

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:90%
there's no bear around here.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And he was hitting the
water with a stick,

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:90%
and they told him, hey.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.411 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chasing
the fish away, yeah.

00:09:47.411 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Right.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, you and I,
being dads, if we

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
saw that kid in the middle
of nowhere, walking along,

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.833 align:middle line:84%
I'd grab the kids and say,
you sit down right here

00:09:54.833 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:90%
and you wait for your guardian.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.680 align:middle line:90%
They let this kid go.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Jaryd walked on.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:90%
He was never seen alive again.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not smart.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Now, four
years later and 600 feet up

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
the trail-- I've been on this
trail 20 times-- and my son

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and I went up to
that location to film

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.214 align:middle line:90%
where his remains were found.

00:10:16.214 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And, George, I can tell you.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.171 align:middle line:84%
I've never made a
tougher climb in my life.

00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
It was probably 70
degrees almost straight up

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.547 align:middle line:90%
for 600 feet.

00:10:23.547 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exhausting.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Exhausting,
and at the top

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and in this boulder-ridden
area, they found his skull cap,

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and they found one tooth
sitting on top of a log.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One tooth?

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And
then they his shoes,

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.670 align:middle line:90%
sweatshirt, and his pants.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.087 align:middle line:90%
Now, imagine the scenario that--

00:10:44.087 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Four years later?

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.832 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Four years later,
four winters in Colorado,

00:10:47.832 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:84%
they turn all the evidence
over to the Colorado

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Bureau of Investigation.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:90%
And I have held the shoes.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.540 align:middle line:84%
George, they look brand
new, like they were never

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.269 align:middle line:90%
sitting outside.

00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never weathered.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And then the
pants were turned inside out.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And the sweatshirt
he was wearing still

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
had vibrant colors,
but the sweatshirt,

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:84%
the pants, the shoes,
there was no blood on them.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've interviewed
Allyn, his dad.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they didn't
look like they were out

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:90%
in the weather for four years?

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: No,
not in the least.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's as if
something brought it back,

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.915 align:middle line:90%
maybe within days.

00:11:23.915 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.182 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: That's to
me what it looks like.

00:11:29.182 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
keep clothes out there

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.850 align:middle line:84%
in Colorado for four
years without it

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.202 align:middle line:84%
looking like somebody was
in a mud wrestling contest.

00:11:36.202 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well, then
you think about the wind

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.620 align:middle line:90%
and the rain and the snow.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's dirty outside.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: You think it
would have been blown off.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, right?

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So in speaking to
Allyn and interviewing him,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:84%
he said one thing my son never
did is he never tied his shoes.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:90%
He was a little boy.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to a lot of
people, and I don't understand.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:84%
If a mountain lion
had grabbed him

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:84%
or a bear had grabbed him
and drug him up that hill,

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.770 align:middle line:84%
there's no way those shoes
would have stayed on his feet.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.535 align:middle line:84%
The clothing was presented to
four different mountain lion

00:12:04.535 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:84%
experts, and each of
them said, there's

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.401 align:middle line:84%
no way a mountain
lion killed that boy.

00:12:08.401 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
There would've been blood
all over the clothing.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.609 align:middle line:84%
His garments would have
been torn to shreds.

00:12:12.609 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't the scenario.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shocking.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:84%
You know what we don't
talk a lot about--

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get into
some of these case studies

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:24.360 align:middle line:84%
in a minute-- is the grief that
the parents are going through.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Have you done some followups
with some of the parents years

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:90%
later?

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Has their life changed?

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Are they never the same?

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:90%
What is happening to them?

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: That is the part
that is just unbelievable to me

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.910 align:middle line:84%
is that, again, as
a parent, I always

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:84%
had heartache when
I didn't see my son

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.544 align:middle line:84%
or daughter under
scenarios I should

00:12:47.544 --> 00:12:48.710 align:middle line:90%
have for just a few seconds.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:53.810 align:middle line:84%
It happens so quickly that
I think that sometimes

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.230 align:middle line:90%
our emotions just take over.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:84%
But imagine if your son or
daughter had disappeared,

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:90%
and it's now 15 years later.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No closure, no closure.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: No closure, no help,
no assistance, no explanation,

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.475 align:middle line:84%
and people just want to
wash their hands of it

00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:90%
and walk away.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And that is a
recurring scenario.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what country you're
in, that is what's happening.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these
parents speculate on what

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:90%
they think might have happened?

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So in the case of
the little boy, Jaryd Atadero--

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.882 align:middle line:84%
Allyn, his dad, is a
teacher in Colorado.

00:13:32.882 --> 00:13:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed
him many times,

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:40.021 align:middle line:84%
and he has a very open mind
because he knows a couple

00:13:40.021 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:84%
He knows a mountain lion or
a bear did not kill his son.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
He has a difficult time
believing that that clothing

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.590 align:middle line:90%
was out there for four years.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.614 align:middle line:84%
He got a phone call right in
the middle of this big search

00:13:54.614 --> 00:13:57.155 align:middle line:84%
effort, maybe two weeks into
it, by somebody saying that they

00:13:57.155 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:84%
were from the Sheriff's Office,
and they were withholding

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle line:90%
information from you.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I hope you
find the truth someday,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.816 align:middle line:90%
and they hung up.

00:14:05.816 --> 00:14:08.689 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh, that's weird.

00:14:08.689 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Very weird,
and Allyn's told me

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:84%
before, it's bothered him,
you know, 16, 17 years later.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And he and I have some
really good discussions.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:90%
He read my book.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
He contacted me,
and he said, Dave,

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.670 align:middle line:84%
you're one of the few guys who
was willing to tell the truth

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.885 align:middle line:90%
and tell the whole story.

00:14:23.885 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
know, a lot of people

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
just want to think
it's something natural.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.904 align:middle line:84%
The local press
will just say, oh,

00:14:29.904 --> 00:14:31.070 align:middle line:90%
it's a mountain lion attack.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A mountain
lion or a disappearance,

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
wandered off and died,
the elements got him.

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Exactly,
and he said few

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
want to get in and know the
facts and hear from experts.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, in our documentary, we're
going to present those experts

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:90%
and let the facts be known.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Let people decide on
their own what's going on.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Geez, are you close
with any of the family members?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Several, yeah, and
when we first got into this--

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I believe in something.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in not replicating
other people's research

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:90%
in pain and agony.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I contacted a couple of
missing person's organizations,

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:84%
explained to them what I
was going to do, and I said,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.369 align:middle line:90%
help me out.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to step
on any landmines

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.484 align:middle line:90%
that you've stepped on.

00:15:14.484 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things they said is

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
that if you're going to write
a book about disappearances,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:84%
don't be proactive
in reaching out

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to the victims
and their families

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:84%
because they may feel
as though they're

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%
being revictimized
by you writing

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.250 align:middle line:90%
a book about their event.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So we've been very
careful about that.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sensitive,
very sensitive.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.535 align:middle line:10%
>>PAULIDES: One of the
things that I won't do

00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:10%
is I won't be proactive and
contact a victim unless they've

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:10%
contacted me.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:10%
If they've contacted
us and initiated that,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.610 align:middle line:10%
I'll go introduce myself.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Every time that's happened,
that has been very rewarding

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:84%
on my end because of
getting to know them.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.939 align:middle line:90%
They're good people.

00:15:50.939 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about some of the cases

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:84%
of these disappearing
people, David.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:90%
How about Larry DeWayne Krebbs?

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:04.025 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: He was at Lake
Texoma in southern Oklahoma,

00:16:04.025 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
a little boy, two years
old, with his dad camping

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:90%
on the weekend.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were out
middle of the afternoon

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:84%
one day collecting firewood,
and the little boy, his dad

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
said was just eight
paces behind him.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.990 align:middle line:90%
He could hear him.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This desk
is four feet long.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.090 align:middle line:90%
So you just double it.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:26.730 align:middle line:90%
That's nothing.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Not far,
and you wouldn't

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
call that negligent either,
I mean, we've all done that.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, and you
turn around, you turn around.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Yeah,
well, his dad said

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.353 align:middle line:84%
he turned around at one point,
and his son wasn't there.

00:16:41.353 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.191 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And Search
and Rescue came in,

00:16:44.191 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:90%
and they searched.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.065 align:middle line:84%
And they said that they
followed a series of prints

00:16:47.065 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:84%
behind his dad's that walked
into a puddle of water,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.779 align:middle line:90%
and that was it.

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And the puddle of water
was a couple inches deep.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't big.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.761 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it
wasn't like a hole.

00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: No, and a
massive search found nothing.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, Larry's
never been found.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So little
two-year-old prints leading up

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.207 align:middle line:90%
to a puddle and then nothing.

00:17:09.207 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Nothing.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.006 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.006 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:90%
So imagine law enforcement.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you explain this?

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.425 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Imagine law
enforcement or Search

00:17:17.425 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:84%
and Rescue, never worked a case
like that before, sees that.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.329 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, at the
beginning, your focus

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.310 align:middle line:90%
is going to be on the dad.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.410 align:middle line:90%
And after you exclude him--

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you realize the
dad is in tremendous mourning.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:90%
He's in shock.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Oh, yeah, and
then imagine you're the dad,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and law enforcement
is looking at you.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you've
got to understand that.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Hopefully, you do.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:39.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know, I would.

00:17:39.955 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I would.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:84%
As upset as I would be for
them even to question it,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand that
you're the first suspect.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:84%
You're the last
one to see the kid.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.852 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Right, it's a
hard line for law enforcement

00:17:51.852 --> 00:17:54.060 align:middle line:84%
to walk, and it's even a
harder line for the parents.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:84%
But having that belief system,
what you just explained,

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
would be perfect for getting law
enforcement passed that point.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, Larry's
never been found.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Logic tells you
that the kid was picked up,

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.255 align:middle line:90%
picked up and disappeared.

00:18:13.255 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.670 align:middle line:90%
He obviously didn't walk around.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:90%
There was no scuffle.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
There weren't serial killer
people or sickos or cults.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:90%
You would've seen all that.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.417 align:middle line:90%
He would have heard that.

00:18:26.417 --> 00:18:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And, again,
you would have found

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:90%
tracks on the ground.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.282 align:middle line:84%
There would've
been a scent trail.

00:18:31.282 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And even under that
scenario, he couldn't

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.406 align:middle line:84%
have gone in the ground because
the water was still there.

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lindsay Page,
Eloise Lindsay Page.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: That is one
of the more unusual stores

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:84%
along the Appalachian
Trail in South Carolina.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:84%
She was in Table
Rock State Park.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've written a lot
about the Appalachian Trail.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
really unusual things

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.070 align:middle line:84%
that have happened there and a
lot of strange disappearances

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:90%
all along there.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:90%
She was an older lady.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I think she was
in her early 20s,

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:90%
going to do a hike of 43 miles.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.474 align:middle line:84%
And she was well prepared,
lots of experience.

00:19:11.474 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:84%
She was going to get picked
up I think seven to eight days

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:90%
after her drop off point.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, she wasn't there
for the pick-up point.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Her story is that about
three days into it,

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:84%
there were a series of men
that were following her

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:90%
and harassing her on the trail.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.587 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you just take
it at that point, hey,

00:19:29.587 --> 00:19:30.420 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's happened.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: This
went on for days,

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and eventually, 14,
18 days, a hunter

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:90%
finds her cowering in the woods.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cowering, she's alive.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Alive,
they bring her out,

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and she tells this story
that these men followed her,

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:90%
harassed her.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:90%
She dumped her backpack.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.946 align:middle line:90%
She got rid of everything.

00:19:53.946 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And then she eventually
went to the hospital.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:84%
The interesting part
of the story to me

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
isn't what she said
because she never

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:90%
explained exactly what she saw.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle line:84%
But when her mom was
interviewed, her mom said,

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what really
happened to my daughter

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:84%
in the woods, and I don't
really know for sure what

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:90%
my daughter saw in the woods.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Huh, like she was not
accepting the story of the men?

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Or her
daughter obviously

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
wasn't comfortable in
telling the whole story.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.260 align:middle line:84%
But that scenario of the men
along the Appalachian Trail,

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:84%
there's been many
disappearances there

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:84%
over the years where people
are just never found.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman named
Geraldine Largay

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:84%
that was in Maine, that was
walking the entire Appalachian

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Trail.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And every day, or every
two days, her husband

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:90%
would resupply her.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:84%
She was 66 years old, I
think, maybe a little older,

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.230 align:middle line:90%
phenomenal shape.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
She called her husband all
the time, one day didn't call.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Massive search,
Maine Warden Service

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
threw everything at that
search, and even the wardens

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.530 align:middle line:84%
said they couldn't believe
they didn't find anything

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:90%
of her, still never been found.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.840 align:middle line:90%
That was a real troubling one.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:84%
The other real troubling
one occurred in the '60s.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.275 align:middle line:84%
Dennis Martin, him,
his dad, his grandpa--

00:21:20.275 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little kid, again?

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Oh,
yeah, six years old.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, something
about little kids.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Little kids.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And they were on Spence Field
in Great Smoky Mountain National

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Park.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
strange parts to this story.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:39.744 align:middle line:84%
And as they were camped in this
area, a family walks up to them

00:21:39.744 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and introduced
themselves and says, hey,

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.300 align:middle line:90%
can our kids play together?

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:90%
Sure, that'd be great.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And he reaches out and shakes
Mr. Martin's hand and goes,

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:84%
um, our names are
the Martins, too.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's pretty--
what would be the odds?

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Odds are high.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:90%
You've got a kid.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Your name is Martin.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like a doppelganger
or something, you know?

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Yeah,
and so Mr. Martin

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.800 align:middle line:84%
says that he sees Dennis-- they
start playing hide and seek--

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:84%
sees Dennis go behind
a tree just a few feet

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.580 align:middle line:90%
off the Appalachian Trail.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.857 align:middle line:84%
They're playing hide and
seek for 50 seconds, nothing,

00:22:15.857 --> 00:22:17.190 align:middle line:90%
everyone's supposed to come out.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Dennis doesn't come out.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Martin said, I knew,
Dave, something was wrong.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:90%
I ran right to the tree.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:90%
Dennis wasn't there.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Martin was a
long-distance runner.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.484 align:middle line:84%
He ran for two miles, nonstop,
down the Appalachian Trail.

00:22:28.484 --> 00:22:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the place.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Just straight down
the trail because he figured

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:90%
that's the only place--

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.211 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the only way
you're going to go, right?

00:22:34.211 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Right,
so he comes back.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:90%
His dad runs down, gets rangers.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.315 align:middle line:84%
This is one of those scenarios
where it started at about 4:30

00:22:42.315 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:90%
that afternoon.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:90%
It started to rain.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:47.000 align:middle line:90%
It rained nonstop for two weeks.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, during that
two-week period,

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:52.011 align:middle line:84%
the Park Service threw
everything at it.

00:22:52.011 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:84%
They not only threw
everything they could at it,

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:58.122 align:middle line:84%
but they also called in the
Green Berets, reportedly.

00:22:58.122 --> 00:22:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wow, that's
heavy hitting.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: I get a case file.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
It's about two inches
thick on this incident,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:90%
from the Park Service.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.320 align:middle line:90%
One of the times, they complied.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And in that report, it
never says anywhere,

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.810 align:middle line:84%
anywhere in any of
those reports, who

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.852 align:middle line:90%
called the Green Berets.

00:23:13.852 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, Dwight McCarter
was the head tracker

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.600 align:middle line:84%
for the Park Service when
he retired in that region.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:90%
And I asked Dwight.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I said, so, Dwight,
who called them?

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.260 align:middle line:90%
He says, I don't know, Dave.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so was
there anything unusual?

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, he says,
when the Green Berets

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.660 align:middle line:84%
came in, they set up a camp
away from everybody else.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:84%
They set up their own
communication system.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
They supposedly had
never been in the park.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And they said the
Park Service offered

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.900 align:middle line:84%
to partner a few of
them with one of theirs

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.070 align:middle line:90%
because they knew the park.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Green Berets said,
no, we'll work alone.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And Dwight said that they
never talked to them.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.190 align:middle line:90%
They never dealt with them.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.210 align:middle line:90%
They were there a week.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.450 align:middle line:84%
They flew in in helicopters,
left in helicopters.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:01.530 align:middle line:84%
No one ever took responsibility
of who called them.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, as this is
going on, there's

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:84%
a family that enters the
park, and their last name

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.420 align:middle line:84%
is the Key family,
K-E-Y. Now, what's

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:84%
interesting about that
is that this is what

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.350 align:middle line:90%
I think the key to the case.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.112 align:middle line:84%
They ask a ranger where
they could go to see bear.

00:24:20.112 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
The ranger sends them
to this area called

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Rowans Creek in the park.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:84%
It's about two or three
miles from Spence Meadows,

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:34.030 align:middle line:84%
where the Martin family
was at, and it's downhill.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.870 align:middle line:84%
They go into the
Rowans Creek area.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:84%
They walk in on
this rural trail,

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of get
split up a little bit.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And the dad and
his sons are ahead.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And as they're walking up,
they hear this, in their words,

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:90%
sickening, loud scream.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Finally, we hear
a sound from something.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Correct.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is hours after
Dennis disappeared,

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.170 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't know
anything happened.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And their 12-year-old
boy looks up on the hill,

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.360 align:middle line:90%
and he says, Dad, look at that.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
A bear is running
around on the hill.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Key looks up on the hill and
says, son, that's not a bear.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.315 align:middle line:90%
That's a man.

00:25:10.315 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:90%
And he says, really?

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't get
a good view of it

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:84%
because it kept
hiding behind trees.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So they watch it
for a little bit.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.550 align:middle line:84%
They never see a bear, so
they ended up going back.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know anything
happened that day.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.200 align:middle line:90%
They leave.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:90%
They go home.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.406 align:middle line:84%
And the next day in
the Knoxville Times,

00:25:27.406 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
a headline is this
boy disappears.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.410 align:middle line:84%
They think they should
contact the park.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:35.820 align:middle line:84%
They do, and by this
time, an FBI agent

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.610 align:middle line:84%
is on scene
monitoring the search,

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.650 align:middle line:84%
but not participating,
according to them.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:90%
He's monitoring.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So the FBI and an investigator
from the Park Service

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:90%
take the call.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.940 align:middle line:84%
The Key family says, hey,
we'll come to the park

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and show you exactly
where we were

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.090 align:middle line:84%
at when we saw it, which
as a former investigator,

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.770 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what I'd want.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.960 align:middle line:84%
I'd want to see
their perspective.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened is
that they told them,

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.280 align:middle line:90%
don't come to the park.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.256 align:middle line:90%
We'll meet you.

00:26:05.256 --> 00:26:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mr. Martin
had an agreement

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:84%
with all the investigators
that anything they heard,

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:90%
he would immediately know.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.390 align:middle line:84%
He was never told
about this for weeks

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.700 align:middle line:84%
later until a reporter from
the Knoxville Times came to him

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and said, do you
know about this?

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.870 align:middle line:90%
He said he blew his lid.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He should have.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.254 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: But the FBI
told the Key family, hey,

00:26:24.254 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:90%
it's impossible.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not related.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:26.670 align:middle line:90%
He told the FBI.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:90%
He told the press.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not related.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, the press
didn't believe it.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So they go to Dwight
McCarter, the tracker.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And since the FBI agent
said it's impossible,

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:84%
the timing doesn't work,
McCarter told Mr. Martin,

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:43.360 align:middle line:90%
let's make the walk together.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how far we can go.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:84%
McCarter proved it could
be, it could happen.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.620 align:middle line:90%
The timing could work.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, myself and another
investigator went to Knoxville.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.210 align:middle line:84%
We went right to Mr. Martin's
house, knocked on the door,

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.970 align:middle line:90%
and met the man.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And this was about four years
ago, and I explained who I was.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.634 align:middle line:84%
And I explained, Mr. Martin,
there's probably nobody

00:27:07.634 --> 00:27:09.800 align:middle line:84%
else you know of that knows
as much about your son's

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.230 align:middle line:90%
disappearance as you and me.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to ask a
little bit of your time.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And I could see his
wife in the next room,

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Dave, we
spend a lifetime trying

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.260 align:middle line:90%
to get this behind us.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I agreed I wouldn't talk
to anybody else about it

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's caused
me nothing but grief.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I said, give me 15
minutes, please.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I came all the way from
California for this.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:90%
He says, OK.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.996 align:middle line:90%
He steps outside.

00:27:31.996 --> 00:27:33.370 align:middle line:84%
George, in all my
career, I don't

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:84%
know if I've had a tougher
conversation with anybody.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.350 align:middle line:84%
He said that there's
so much about the story

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:90%
that the press won't talk about.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Dave, thank you for
taking the time to understand,

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.490 align:middle line:84%
but I can't tell
you how much I'm

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:84%
disturbed by the Park Service
and the newspaper and the press

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.830 align:middle line:84%
not telling the truth and trying
to hide the truth from me.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the part
about the Key family.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And he says, do you
know what they never

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.840 align:middle line:84%
would put in the paper and they
would never put in a report?

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.362 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's that?

00:28:09.362 --> 00:28:10.820 align:middle line:84%
You know what they
saw on the hill?

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:11.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
It was carrying something
on its shoulder.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.470 align:middle line:84%
He said, I talked
to the Key family.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:84%
The newspapers wouldn't
put that in the newspaper.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.856 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, did you find that
in any Park Service report?

00:28:21.856 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, there was nothing--

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.938 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was the little
boy on the shoulders

00:28:24.938 --> 00:28:26.690 align:middle line:90%
of whatever that was.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.916 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well,
there's nothing

00:28:28.916 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:84%
in that two inches of
document about the Key family

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.060 align:middle line:90%
observation.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And I asked
him, what else is there

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:36.819 align:middle line:90%
I should know about this case?

00:28:36.819 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:84%
This is after 15, 20 minutes,
and Mr. Martin said, well,

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.992 align:middle line:84%
do you know that FBI agent
that was on the scene?

00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:44.700 align:middle line:10%
I said, yeah, he was
on the scene for all

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.550 align:middle line:10%
the disappearances in Smoky
Mountain National Park

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.910 align:middle line:10%
and the other nine
disappearances I documented

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:50.410 align:middle line:10%
in the area.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.967 align:middle line:10%
He was that agent.

00:28:52.967 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:10%
Because you know
what happened to him?

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:55.961 align:middle line:10%
I said, no.

00:28:55.961 --> 00:28:57.710 align:middle line:10%
He says, he committed suicide.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.506 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:28:59.506 --> 00:29:01.130 align:middle line:10%
>>PAULIDES: And about
a month later, we

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.080 align:middle line:10%
confirmed he committed suicide.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
unbelievable story.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.220 align:middle line:84%
David, you keep
doing what you're

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.820 align:middle line:84%
doing, all right,
because somebody's

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.730 align:middle line:90%
got to watch this story.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you much for being on.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: My pleasure, George.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: These
stories are probably

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.230 align:middle line:10%
the scariest I have ever heard
in my 46 years of broadcasting,

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.680 align:middle line:10%
uncovered by a man will
not give up until he gets

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.350 align:middle line:10%
these answers, David Paulides.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:37.984 align:middle line:90%
