>>RICHARD MARTINI:
On her deathbed,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:84%
my close friend said she thought
she was going to another galaxy

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.770 align:middle line:90%
after her death.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
She said she had a
recurring vision.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:84%
She was in a classroom with
everyone dressed in white,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.690 align:middle line:90%
in a class about spirituality.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:10%
And some months
after her death, I

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:10%
had a spontaneous out-of-body
experience, where she guided me

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:10%
to that place, her galaxy.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:10%
I felt I had actually
been to visit

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.199 align:middle line:10%
my dear friend in her
new part of the universe.

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:10%
You know, nothing
fascinates me more

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.570 align:middle line:10%
than the existence of
the afterlife and that's

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.174 align:middle line:10%
what we're talking
about on tonight's show.

00:01:02.174 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:10%
>>ANNOUNCER: He's your tour
guide to the afterlife.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:10%
In his book and
related documentary,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.960 align:middle line:10%
"Flipside," author and
award-winning filmmaker Richard

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:10%
Martini uncovered new
evidence for life after death.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:84%
"Flipside" explored the work
of hypnotherapy pioneer Dr.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Michael Newton, including
hypnotherapist interviews,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
footage of past
life regressions,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and sessions that
explore what happens

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.700 align:middle line:90%
during the time between lives.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:84%
After a literary
quest that took him

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:84%
as far as Tibet and to the
frontiers of consciousness,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.875 align:middle line:84%
Richard reveals what he has
found today on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And Richard's
other book, of course,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.630 align:middle line:10%
"Hacking the Afterlife."

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.865 align:middle line:10%
I love that title.

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Isn't that cool?

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:10%
It's high technology.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Well, it
sounds like high tech

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:10%
but I realized as I was
doing this research that I

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:10%
was getting information from
people on the other side

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:10%
that we could use here.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
there was a method

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
that we could figure out how
to talk to somebody who's

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
no longer on the planet
and ask them for help,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:84%
whether it's how
to turn salt water

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
into fresh water for
pennies or whatever

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:90%
those questions might be.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
what a wonderful way

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.979 align:middle line:84%
to get information from people
who've been here before.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, people
have been doing that

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:84%
since the dawn of time, mediums
and psychics and everything.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.022 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, I'm sort
of taking the research

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
that I've done
before in "Flipside"

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and "It's a Wonderful Afterlife"
kind of like the blueprint

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:84%
of the flipside, the
blueprint of the afterlife,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and taking a look at it to
see how can I ask people

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
over there the
answers to questions

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:90%
that we'd like to know here?

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, the usual thing
when you see a medium is you

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:84%
sit down and you're there
to learn two things.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:84%
What's my future and
do I have a soul mate?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And my idea was instead of
doing that, why don't we

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:84%
sit with somebody who has a
mouthpiece to the other side

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and ask them if they can
ask people questions.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.380 align:middle line:90%
That's

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.905 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So I'm doing your
gig with people on the flipside.

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: It's like I'm-- I
mean, I learned at your foot.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:10%
I mean, because you're
so good at what you do.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:10%
But the idea of.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You may kiss my ring.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: But you are
really good at that.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:10%
You're really good at allowing a
guest to sound completely sane,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:10%
we know that.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:84%
But also to elicit
things from people.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm trying
to do, elicit information

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
from people who are no
longer on the planet.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, people could argue,
you're imagining this.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But if what they
say or you imagine

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
turns out to be something
that's valuable to people then

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:90%
is there any harm?

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So be it.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Exactly.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So be it.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger, I read
"The Tibetan Book of the Dead"

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a little
experience with things

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:90%
that happen in Tibet.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.660 align:middle line:90%
What's so important about that?

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.784 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, I'll tell
you, that kind of set me

00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:84%
on this journey because I had
a friend who had passed away

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and she came to visit me or it
felt like she came to visit me.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.200 align:middle line:84%
But a number of things
that I observed.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
She was younger than
when I knew her.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Her spirit seemed like
she was in her 20s.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.501 align:middle line:90%
I had met her in her 30s.

00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:84%
But she had passed
away and so now,

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:84%
here she was showing me
things, taking me around

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.880 align:middle line:84%
in what felt like an
out-of-body experience.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, how
does she know how to do this?

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.085 align:middle line:84%
How can she have access
to me in this way?

00:04:30.085 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, she had been

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.320 align:middle line:90%
a Buddhist for a long time.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, maybe
Buddhism has some clue

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.750 align:middle line:90%
into the afterlife.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I was flying to New York City,
and I picked up the "New York

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Times" magazine and there was
an article about Robert Thurman.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the article,
Robert talked about

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
how the old professor
that he had had--

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's Uma's father.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.148 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD MARTINI: Uma's
father, correct, yeah.

00:04:50.148 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And talking about the
old teacher that he had.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:10%
When he had gone to visit the
reincarnation of his teacher,

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:10%
the teacher-- and Bob
has told me this story

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:10%
a couple of times--
teacher looked at him

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:10%
and said, Thurman-- he was five
years old-- he said, Thurman,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.490 align:middle line:10%
I was so disappointed in you
when you left the monkhood.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.360 align:middle line:10%
And Thurman said--
because no one knew

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:10%
that he was coming to this
meeting-- and he said,

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:10%
the kid looked just like,
suddenly his face looked just

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:10%
like his old teacher.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:10%
And he tried to
explain to him, well,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:10%
I felt it was necessary to teach
Buddhism on a grander scale.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:10%
And the kid seemed
happy with that

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.240 align:middle line:10%
and went off on his tricycle.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, Thurman must

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
have some insight into the
flipside, how to get there.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And Bob had actually done
a wonderful translation

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.530 align:middle line:84%
of "The Tibetan
Book of the Dead."

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to
New York City and I

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:90%
audited his philosophy class.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, film guy,
television guy,

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:84%
working on the "Charles
Grodin Show" by day

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and then I sneak into
this philosophy class.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But it was fascinating
and as a result of that,

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Bob and I became friends and
we went to Tibet together.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.626 align:middle line:84%
I filmed a documentary
of us going around Mount

00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Kailash, many other things.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:84%
But as I studied "The
Tibetan Book of the Dead,"

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
it's one monk's observation
of what happens when we die,

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:90%
very accurate.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, if you have any
hospice people that come by,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.740 align:middle line:84%
they have a list of what
happens if somebody passes away.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
It's identical to "The
Tibetan Book of the Dead,"

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.880 align:middle line:90%
the different dissolutions.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But in "The Tibetan
Book of the Dead,"

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
this one monk said, once
we get into the bardo,

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.690 align:middle line:84%
the between lives realm,
we're like a wisp of smoke

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and we float around
until karma dictates

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:90%
where we're going to return.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, in my experiences
visiting Luana Anders,

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:84%
my friend who had passed
away, I felt fully conscious.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like
a wisp of smoke.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, that
doesn't seem accurate to me.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I ran into the
work of Michael Newton, who

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:03.170 align:middle line:84%
over his 30, 40-year career,
he had over 7,000 patients

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:90%
under deep hypnosis.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.219 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He just passed.

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: He just
passed away last week

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:10%
and appeared with
me a couple days ago

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.699 align:middle line:10%
while I was having
lunch with a medium.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: After he passed.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.865 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: After he passed.

00:07:16.865 --> 00:07:20.210 align:middle line:10%
She turned to me and said,
Michael Newton is here.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:90%
And I went, what do you mean?

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.400 align:middle line:84%
She said, he just appeared
over your shoulder.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.270 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't know Michael Newton.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, what's he
here to tell us?

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:84%
He said it's important to
remember the people who

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.460 align:middle line:90%
have gone on the flipside.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
He said everyone has the
ability to communicate

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.937 align:middle line:84%
to their loved ones who have
passed, not just mediums.

00:07:40.937 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has that ability.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a matter of tuning.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.725 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And
then I said, well,

00:07:47.725 --> 00:07:49.620 align:middle line:84%
how can I-- I'm going
to be on George's show.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
you want me to say?

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said, try to find
a space in your life

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:84%
where you remember those
who were your loved

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
ones because they still exist
and they're happy to be called

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.820 align:middle line:90%
to your dinner table.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So, I said, you mean, like
Thanksgiving dinner put out

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.820 align:middle line:84%
some extra chairs like
Elijah and the Seder,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.682 align:middle line:84%
put out an extra chair
for your loved ones

00:08:12.682 --> 00:08:14.265 align:middle line:84%
and talk about them
over Thanksgiving?

00:08:14.265 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
look weird doing that?

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, of course,
you know, is it a seance?

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got Thanksgiving
come up, who knows?

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.626 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Here's
what I'm saying,

00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:84%
is when you do your Thanksgiving
put out an extra chair and then

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:84%
just say-- and maybe
put out something that--

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or your
Christmas or whatever.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Whatever.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Put out something they owned,
maybe a scarf, maybe a thing,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:90%
because it helps you focus.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Or a photograph, very
simple, and then,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:84%
meditate a little bit on
where was that picture taken,

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
who were these people,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And allow yourself to ask them
questions in present tense.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
how are you doing?

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:90%
And I hope you're having fun.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm sure you're
aware of this,

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.610 align:middle line:84%
many cultures treat
the dead differently

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.920 align:middle line:90%
than we do in the West.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.319 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We are a
little standoffish.

00:09:05.319 --> 00:09:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, we're like,
oh, put them in the coffin

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:90%
and get them under.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:10%
But I noticed that the
Mexican culture and there's

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:10%
a lot of cemeteries
in Los Angeles

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:10%
right around New Year's,
Christmas, families

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:10%
go and put out a picnic.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.255 align:middle line:10%
And they sit around
and they celebrate.

00:09:21.255 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They celebrate.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.148 align:middle line:10%
They have a great time.

00:09:23.148 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Exactly and so
here's what I'm saying,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.152 align:middle line:10%
the research shows, the
data shows, we don't die.

00:09:31.152 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're convinced
of that yourself, right?

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I'm convinced that
that's what the data shows.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Even if I didn't
believe it, I can't

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.220 align:middle line:90%
argue with thousands of people.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The facts.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.895 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: The facts.

00:09:41.895 --> 00:09:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And so once you allow
that we don't die,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.980 align:middle line:84%
then everything kind of goes
up-- so why punish people

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:84%
or why try to kill
somebody for vengeance?

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:90%
You can't kill them.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: They're
still going to exist.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.954 align:middle line:10%
You've given them a
one-way ticket out of here

00:10:00.954 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:10%
and maybe they wanted to go.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They may come back and
get you and take you with them.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.769 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: They
haven't disappeared.

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And so "The Tibetan
Book of the Dead"

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.750 align:middle line:84%
talks about that, in
terms of how we get there.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.394 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's a training guide
for the living, isn't it?

00:10:15.394 --> 00:10:17.560 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: It's a training
guide for how you depart.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:10%
However, as I've
talked to Bob about,

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:10%
Newton had these 7,000
people, Helen Wambach,

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Helen Wambach, also
10 years before Newton,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:10%
same thing, hypnosis,
same amount of clients,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:10%
2,000 clients.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:84%
They all talk about that we
choose to come back here.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:90%
We choose our parents.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
We choose who we're going
to be, male or female.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have that choice.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: It's apparently
based on free will.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:84%
That report is consistent
and if it was different

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.100 align:middle line:90%
I would report it but it's not.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And so if it is
true, that we choose

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.190 align:middle line:84%
to come here and choose--
that we're not a wisp of smoke

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:84%
between lives, that what people
say is that only about a third

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:84%
of our energy comes here
but 2/3 of our energy

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:84%
is always outside
the pool, offstage.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
choose, though, Rich,

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.300 align:middle line:84%
why do some people choose
lousy parents, you know--

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Excellent question.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who abuse them
and things like that?

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Excellent question
and I ask people that.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I say, to them, you know, so
why did you choose your parents?

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.436 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, I did well.

00:11:21.436 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:90%
I picked great parents.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Me, too.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But most of our friends
will say, I didn't choose.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Are you out of your mind?

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Why would I choose these people?

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And I say, that's
why you're sitting

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:84%
in front of me telling me this
sentence because you got away

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:90%
from them as fast as you could.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:90%
You overcame the difficulty.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
When we go to the
theater and we watch

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.880 align:middle line:84%
somebody overcome a
problem or a dilemma,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.360 align:middle line:90%
they've learned something.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:90%
They've mastered that.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.640 align:middle line:84%
They turned the big piece
of charcoal into a diamond.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, they
take an adverse situation

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:90%
and make it better.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.138 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And they
have learned from it.

00:11:58.138 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:90%
They've overcome it.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:84%
They're smarter than we
are because we didn't

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:90%
have to overcome that stuff.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Those people have mastered
those lessons and we don't die.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost
like a university.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:90%
You come to class.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:90%
You go through difficult things.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.890 align:middle line:84%
I know this is stressful
for people to hear,

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.187 align:middle line:84%
especially with they've gone
through stressful things.

00:12:17.187 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:90%
I totally understand that.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everybody has.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Everybody has but
if you can just reframe it--

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
because in this
book, this new book,

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I interview people under deep
hypnosis about their life

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
planning session, where
they talk about who's

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.400 align:middle line:90%
going to play the bad guy.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:90%
And the person has to volunteer.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, would you
play my alcoholic parent for me

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:90%
and that person could say, no.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
I did it, you know,
the Viking era.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't want to go there.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.655 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I don't
want to do it again.

00:12:46.655 --> 00:12:47.890 align:middle line:90%
I hated that.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:84%
But this person says,
you were so good at it

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't
play the part, I'll

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.910 align:middle line:84%
never learn the lesson
I'm signing up for.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.879 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is,
like on a stage, who

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:90%
are the characters we remember?

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
We remember the bad
guys, you know, the ones

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:90%
who make it difficult for us.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Very rarely do we
remember the good things.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.140 align:middle line:90%
People remember the bad.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why but they do.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, I think it goes
back to the original Aristotle

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:84%
thing of poetics, that the
essence of drama is conflict.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're coming
here to experience things

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.240 align:middle line:84%
like being in a
play, then the stuff

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:84%
that you want to really get
into on the football field

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:84%
or inside the pool is
the dilemmas, you know,

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:90%
the conflict.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And so you overcome
that conflict

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:90%
so that you can master it.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And if we come
here often, a lot,

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.170 align:middle line:84%
doesn't that make sense to
leave behind a campground that's

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:43.970 align:middle line:90%
fresh air.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would think so.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.059 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: You would think so.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about the
title, "Hacking the Afterlife."

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, what
I mean specifically

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:84%
is, once I came
upon this conclusion

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:84%
for myself, that we don't die,
then that means, oddly enough,

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:84%
everybody who's ever
been here still exists.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.950 align:middle line:84%
If that's true then therefore,
can't we access them?

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So I started asking
people who have access

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:84%
to the flipside or people
who are under deep hypnosis

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
or what I've recently
discovered is

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:84%
that just having a conversation
with someone, because I'm

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.500 align:middle line:84%
so familiar with
this architecture,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm so familiar with the
process-- I know this sounds

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.990 align:middle line:84%
odd-- but just having a regular
conversation with somebody

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:84%
over coffee and asking them
to recall a previous lifetime,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:90%
they can do it.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:84%
What I say is, try not to judge
whatever comes to your mind.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll say, let's go
to a previous lifetime that

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.730 align:middle line:84%
has some significance
in this lifetime, which

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.688 align:middle line:84%
is what they say in the
hypnotherapy questions,

00:14:50.688 --> 00:14:52.850 align:middle line:84%
but you're in a
noisy coffee shop.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And I say, let's imagine
yourself going through

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.284 align:middle line:84%
a tunnel, imagine yourself
going down some stairs,

00:14:59.284 --> 00:15:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and now, when we get
there where are we?

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Is it day or is it night?

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, I don't know.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, just
whatever comes to mind.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.102 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious is always
aware of what I'm asking.

00:15:11.102 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's always working.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: It's always
working and it has access

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:84%
to all that information
because there

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:90%
is no delete key in the brain.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything is stored.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So I will then ask-- or
wherever memory is held.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So I ask, is it
day or is it night?

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Are you a man or
are you a woman?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Are you tall?

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Are you short?

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:90%
How old are you?

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Friend of mine--

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
get those answers?

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: A friend
of mine suddenly--

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:10%
it started like this.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:10%
My friend said, oh, in
college, I did hypnotherapy.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.032 align:middle line:10%
I tried it and it didn't work.

00:15:41.032 --> 00:15:42.240 align:middle line:10%
And I said, what did you see?

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:10%
He said, I saw a
guy with a beard.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.489 align:middle line:10%
And I said, OK,
let's-- can we talk?

00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:10%
Who was the guy with the beard?

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I don't know.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, just
open up your mind.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.281 align:middle line:90%
Who was the guy with the beard?

00:15:54.281 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:90%
He went, oh, it's a prince.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he
came to the story

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:06.710 align:middle line:84%
that he was an assassin in 1820,
sent to kill a Spanish royalty

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.140 align:middle line:90%
but they caught him.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:84%
They tortured him and he
gave up all his friends

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:90%
and they were all executed.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.990 align:middle line:90%
This is over coffee.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, so
where did you live?

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:90%
He said Taormina.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:90%
He had never heard of Taormina.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I know Taormina is in Italy but
was part of the Spanish empire

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:90%
in 1820.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.684 align:middle line:84%
So I said, let's go
into the between lives.

00:16:26.684 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I said, let's go to the
last day of your life.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.725 align:middle line:90%
Where would you like to go?

00:16:29.725 --> 00:16:31.410 align:middle line:90%
He says, I want to go home.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.677 align:middle line:90%
And now we get somewhere.

00:16:32.677 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And I say, is there anybody who
can help us answer a question?

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Somebody came forth and I said,
why are you letting my friend

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:90%
experience this today?

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Why are you allowing him
to see this lifetime?

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And she said, to
show him that there's

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:84%
no action that you can commit
that you can't recover from.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I would
assume that afterlife wasn't

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:90%
a very pleasant one for him.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: But it's
memorable because it's still

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.010 align:middle line:90%
under the surface.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you learn
lessons when you come back?

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I've always thought
reincarnation, Rich,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:84%
was a process of getting better,
reaching stages of perfection.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Where one day you don't
reincarnate anymore.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
You're in heaven or
whatever that state is.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
You just don't
come back anymore.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:21.810 align:middle line:84%
But each time you do, you get
better and better and better.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
said, the mere fact

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:84%
that you and I are
talking about this,

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:90%
we've been elevated somehow.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many more
reincarnated lives we both have

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:84%
but we're getting
pretty close to the top.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, I think
that depends on you.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you get back
to the flipside,

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, and you're back
with your soul group

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's around
you and they go, George,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:90%
that was an amazing life.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:90%
You helped so many people.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:90%
You opened so many doors.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.180 align:middle line:84%
You connected so
many different dots

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:84%
that people hadn't
connected before.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, yeah, thanks.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do so good when I
was like 17 but whatever.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:03.120 align:middle line:84%
You go through that stuff and
then your loved ones say, now

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.454 align:middle line:84%
listen, I'm thinking
we have a new scenario

00:18:05.454 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:90%
we would like to go through.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Would you participate?

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can say,
I don't think so.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I've got
enough information.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.037 align:middle line:84%
But your guides may say,
George, isn't there something

00:18:18.037 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
you might want to work out that
you haven't worked out before?

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And you start
thinking, well, yeah

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.740 align:middle line:84%
there is that little weird thing
about jealousy or whatever.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I can work that out.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:90%
I'll do that.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.032 align:middle line:84%
In my case-- and I mention this
in "Hacking the Afterlife."

00:18:32.032 --> 00:18:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I did one of these
sessions where--

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I've done five now, where I just
focused on the life planning

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.090 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And I saw myself sitting on
a sound stage, a sound stage,

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.984 align:middle line:90%
with an audience.

00:18:44.984 --> 00:18:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting around
with a bunch of people,

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:90%
including my father.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying,
well, it just went

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:84%
without saying that wherever
my dad was going to be

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:90%
I was going to show up.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't matter
to me whether I

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:84%
was going to be a girl
or a boy because that's

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:90%
kind of our journey.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:90%
We like to go on trips together.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I saw it from that perspective
that I hadn't really

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
thought out-- like, I had chosen
to be a filmmaker because I

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:84%
said, under the hypnosis, that
every action, thought, word,

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:84%
or deed, every time you
paint a picture, sing a song,

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.150 align:middle line:84%
do a show, some
part of your energy

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:84%
goes into the universe
and heals people,

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:90%
changes people's disposition.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.840 align:middle line:84%
In my case, I chose
comedy because laughter

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.760 align:middle line:90%
is the best medicine.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is a great medicine.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.763 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Great medicine.

00:19:33.763 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, tears work
but they require

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.810 align:middle line:84%
catharsis, a word I've never
used in a sentence before.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
the reason I chose

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Rich was because I
thought, in a casual way,

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:84%
that film would be a
way of healing people.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So George, the question is this,
here we are in our soul group

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:90%
100 years from now.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.725 align:middle line:84%
And I say to you, I
got this great idea.

00:19:58.725 --> 00:20:00.100 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
come back, you're

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:84%
going to be a
captain of this ship.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.290 align:middle line:84%
You're going to save all
these-- what do you think?

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:90%
It'll be fun.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:90%
We'll have a blast together.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to you to say,
I'm having may cappuccino back

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.700 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:90%
So you see what I'm saying?

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.420 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Art critic
Robert Hughes

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.940 align:middle line:84%
would write a lot
about Francisco Goya,

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.849 align:middle line:84%
the incredible
artist at the time.

00:20:23.849 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at that video.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.482 align:middle line:90%
That will explain a lot.

00:20:27.482 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT HUGHES: Ever since I
started writing art criticism

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:10%
more than 40 years ago I've
dealt with thousands of images

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:10%
but I've always been fascinated
by one particular artist,

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:10%
a Spaniard, Francisco Goya.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.230 align:middle line:10%
This man was one of the
most radical artists

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:10%
that ever lived.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.860 align:middle line:10%
For years, I've been
trying and failing

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.760 align:middle line:10%
to write a book about him.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:10%
And in a weird way that I
didn't expect, but how could I,

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:10%
he took me over.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
About three years ago, I was
nearly killed in a car wreck.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.070 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Six weeks in coma,
months in hospital.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:90%
No white light.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.325 align:middle line:90%
No smiling Jesus.

00:21:09.325 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Only darkness and
hallucination and the creatures

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:20.132 align:middle line:84%
of Goya's imagination
mocking and chattering.

00:21:20.132 --> 00:21:24.916 align:middle line:84%
The whores and duchesses and
witches, corrupt priests,

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:28.546 align:middle line:84%
all laughing at me in the
certainty that this wrecked

00:21:28.546 --> 00:21:32.010 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] imprisoned
by the ruin of his body

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:84%
could never reach into
their world, Goya's world.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But in some way, nearly dying
brought me nearer to him.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That experience
changed Robert Hughes's life

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:90%
after that motorcycle accident.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.370 align:middle line:84%
It literally scared the living
daylights out of him again.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.475 align:middle line:84%
What is that darkness that
you sometimes encounter?

00:21:58.475 --> 00:21:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Thank God.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Thank God it scared
Robert Hughes.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a guy, as a
critic, who's been criticizing

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.780 align:middle line:90%
people his whole life.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly he got
a glimpse of what

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.710 align:middle line:10%
it was like to be a critic.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:10%
And it could very well be that
his higher guides are saying--

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They did that to him.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Yeah,
take a look at what

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.410 align:middle line:84%
you've been doing to
people your whole life.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Change.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Making
people feel miserable

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:90%
and this is what it feels like.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.550 align:middle line:84%
My experience with this is-- and
I've seen it a number of times

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:84%
during a session-- I'm not
doing the hypnosis, I'm filming.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.580 align:middle line:84%
But the hypnotherapist
says, after a lifetime

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:84%
has been lived, where
would you like to go?

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.390 align:middle line:10%
And now they sense
themselves in a dark place,

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:10%
the sulfur smelling--

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: As he did.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.554 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: As he did.

00:22:39.554 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:10%
But of course, everybody
sees it differently.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:10%
He sees Goya.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:10%
Nobody else sees Goya.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD MARTINI: I
wouldn't have seen Goya.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.160 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: I wouldn't
have seen Goya.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
but this one woman
we were filming,

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:84%
who worked with Steve
Jobs, she suddenly

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:90%
saw sulfur and scary things.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the hypnotherapist
said, so why are we here?

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Why did you choose to come here?

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And when he asked
that question, it

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:84%
dissolved because everything
we experience is a choice.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Rajiv Parti-- I think he
might have been on your show--

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:84%
but he was a guy who had
a near death experience

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and within it, he went
to a hellacious place,

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.090 align:middle line:90%
where he saw people with horns.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:90%
I would think it would be hell.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Exactly and I
said, well, hang on a second.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.430 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with horns?

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Horns are made of matted hair.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:90%
That's what horns are.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Many animals have horns.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:84%
You saw a rhino walk
onto your set today,

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.586 align:middle line:84%
would you think,
oh, I'm in hell?

00:23:33.586 --> 00:23:35.760 align:middle line:84%
You'd think, how
did you get on here?

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:84%
My point is, we
associate these things

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:90%
with what we're familiar with.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right,
things we're taught.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.281 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: As soon as
you ask, while you're

00:23:44.281 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:84%
in either conscious or
unconsciously or under

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.710 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis, why did you
choose to come here?

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:84%
It dissolves because those
are just mental pictures

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:90%
that we have created.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.650 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is, consistently,
near death experiences,

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences,
and the thousands of cases

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I've examined and
the 35 I've filmed,

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.165 align:middle line:84%
these people eventually--
once they go beyond the Goya,

00:24:11.165 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:84%
if they choose to
go to the Goya--

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:84%
they go to a place of
unconditional love.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Even Alexander goes to that
place of unconditional love

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:90%
and he gets a tour.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm focusing on,
"Hacking the Afterlife,"

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:84%
is new information
gained from over there.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Alexander's
case is great.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.385 align:middle line:84%
He goes-- he has a
near death-- great.

00:24:33.385 --> 00:24:34.260 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.630 align:middle line:90%
He has a near death experience.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Changes his life.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.371 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Changes his
life but while he's there,

00:24:38.371 --> 00:24:41.479 align:middle line:84%
he is given a tour by a
young, beautiful woman who

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:90%
he has never seen before.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.270 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know who
she is but he feels

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:90%
like he's known her forever.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.240 align:middle line:90%
She guides him around.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Six months after the
experience, the family

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that put him up for adoption
sends him a photograph.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know that he
had a sister who died.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:84%
When he sees the photograph,
he recognizes her instantly.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's new information
from the flipside.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:84%
New information,
meaning he never--

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.450 align:middle line:84%
couldn't have been cryptomnesia,
couldn't have been hypoxia.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:84%
He's meeting someone that he's
never met before in this life

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.670 align:middle line:90%
but he has before.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And so that idea
of new information

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.120 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm focusing on.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.960 align:middle line:84%
My father, after he passed,
woke me up one night.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Shook me.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:90%
I felt his hand on my shoulder.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I heard him say, I'm
experiencing indescribable joy.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:84%
That's something I'd
never heard him say.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want you
to tell your mother,

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:84%
get a pencil and
a piece of paper.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.982 align:middle line:90%
Write this down.

00:25:33.982 --> 00:25:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Tell your mother I love here.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:36.023 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful here.

00:25:36.023 --> 00:25:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm with so-and-so and
so-and-so, people I knew.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, and I'm also with,
and he named six people.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.560 align:middle line:90%
I wrote their names down.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.700 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
conversation, also

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.754 align:middle line:84%
not wondering if I'm making
this up, I said to him,

00:25:48.754 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:90%
why are you telling me this?

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, because you can hear
me, as opposed to my brothers.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
morning, I said to my mom,

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.626 align:middle line:90%
who are these six people?

00:25:57.626 --> 00:25:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
those are his friends

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:90%
who died in World War II.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:01.492 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:26:01.492 --> 00:26:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Not people
that I've ever been aware

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.700 align:middle line:90%
of or heard their names before.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
He's giving me a new piece
of information, you see?

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:84%
So once you get beyond
the, oh, my god, this

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.630 align:middle line:84%
is my father talking
to me or, oh,

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.825 align:middle line:84%
my god, this is Goya's scary
people, start asking questions.

00:26:17.825 --> 00:26:18.625 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:18.625 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:90%
You're fully conscious.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.320 align:middle line:90%
You're aware.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:84%
You're able to ask
questions, to look around.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.900 align:middle line:90%
So I'm saying, drop the fear.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the fear.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.814 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to ask
questions of the flipside

00:26:32.814 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:84%
that you never thought you
could get the answers to.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it easy to
drop the fear, Rich?

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:41.152 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people are
petrified of the other side.

00:26:41.152 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Yeah,
what's that about?

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:44.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They think
it's evil and dark.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So here's
what I try to picture.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Imagine us in a pool.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:84%
We're in a pool,
swimming around.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And we're not above the surface.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we go up for oxygen
but most of the time

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.160 align:middle line:90%
we're down here.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:54.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are we scuba diving?

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.149 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Yeah, we're scuba
diving but without masks.

00:26:57.149 --> 00:26:59.739 align:middle line:10%
And we see, we have our
journey in this water.

00:26:59.739 --> 00:27:00.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You need a mask.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: OK, so we're in--
but we're having this journey,

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.640 align:middle line:90%
right, under the water.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Once we step out of the
pool, and we can all

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.590 align:middle line:84%
sit there and go, outside
the pool it's really scary.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:16.440 align:middle line:84%
It's finding Nemo time once
you're outside the pool.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.900 align:middle line:84%
But once we get
outside the pool,

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:84%
we find out that's
not the case at all.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:84%
That everybody in the pool
has been using that as power

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:90%
to try to scare us.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
people use it as power

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.157 align:middle line:90%
to try to scare us to behave.

00:27:29.157 --> 00:27:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To control.

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: To toe the
line, to do the thing

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.830 align:middle line:90%
that you're supposed to do.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, dude, once
we're outside the pool,

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:84%
once you see that it's all
about unconditional love--

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.380 align:middle line:84%
the reason we get in the pool
is so that we can remember what

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.090 align:middle line:90%
it's like outside the pool.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So we can remember what
unconditional love is.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So we get into the
pool and experience

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.350 align:middle line:84%
non-conditional or
conditional love.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:84%
I only love you if you're
going to vote for me.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.320 align:middle line:84%
But once we get
outside the pool,

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:84%
beyond the light,
as people say--

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.860 align:middle line:90%
and I ask people this question.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And I can do it now talking
to someone consciously who

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:90%
had a near death experience.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, go to the moment
when you got to the light.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.637 align:middle line:90%
Experience it again.

00:28:12.637 --> 00:28:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And while we're
having coffee, they're

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.020 align:middle line:90%
able to say, OK, I'm there.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I say,
describe it to me.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:20.120 align:middle line:90%
What's the light look like?

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Then they give me
their definition.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask,
what's it feel like?

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And almost always, they say it
feels like unconditional love.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If more people
will experience that,

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:90%
we'd have a better planet.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well it's a term
that you and I both know

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:84%
what I'm talking about but
we don't use it in real life.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.407 align:middle line:90%
You don't see it on TV shows.

00:28:41.407 --> 00:28:42.490 align:middle line:90%
You don't see it anywhere.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.530 align:middle line:84%
We are aware of it,
mother to child or parent

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to child, unconditional-- or
a pet, unconditional love.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.310 align:middle line:84%
You did something bad
but I still love you.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:55.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the natural
state of things.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:58.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the natural
state of who we are,

00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:59.460 align:middle line:90%
which is what people say.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not me.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.970 align:middle line:84%
This is what
thousands are saying.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Our natural state is
unconditional love

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:84%
for everybody, regardless
of race, creed, color,

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.460 align:middle line:84%
age, doesn't matter,
unconditional love.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:17.290 align:middle line:84%
We come here to experience like
being on stage, adventures,

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.205 align:middle line:90%
drama, flight, planes.

00:29:20.205 --> 00:29:22.820 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I mentioned
Amelia Earhart showed up

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.635 align:middle line:90%
in this research.

00:29:26.635 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've talked about
that on our "Coast to Coast"

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:90%
show.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:90%
You channel her, don't you?

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Not me.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:84%
A close friend of mine, Phillip
Noyce, the film director,

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.015 align:middle line:84%
said (AUSTRALIAN
ACCENT) Martini--

00:29:37.015 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:90%
he's Australian, sorry.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Pardon my strange accent.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Martini thinks he
talks to the dead.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no Phillip, I talk
to people who talk to the dead.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, I was
working on the movie "Salt"

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.255 align:middle line:84%
with Phillip in 2008,
having lunch with a friend.

00:29:52.255 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And the friend says,
I want you to meet

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Pattie Canova she's a medium.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:90%
I was like, eh, mediums.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that
much about them.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:84%
James Van Praagh, he had
helped me talk to Luana once.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's one of the best.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.583 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: He's one of the best.

00:30:04.583 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Luana
came through to him

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and said to James Van Praagh,
Richard's got a photograph

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:84%
of us on his refrigerator
that's the essence

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.370 align:middle line:90%
of our relationship.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I put that picture
up, I said it aloud.

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Look, the essence
of our relationship.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So I knew beyond a
shadow of a doubt that

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.960 align:middle line:84%
was her talking to me
through James Van Praagh.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rich, you've
done extensive work

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:29.920 align:middle line:84%
investigating the life and
the death of Amelia Earhart.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a look
at a little video first.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:37.850 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:10%
>>ANNOUNCER: Amelia
Earhart came of age

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:10%
as the golden age of aviation
was getting into swing.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.648 align:middle line:90%


00:30:46.648 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:84%
In 1920, Amelia went to an air
show in Long Beach, California,

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.910 align:middle line:84%
where stunt pilots
showed off their skill

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and daring in front
of stunned audiences.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.320 align:middle line:84%
She fell head over heels
in love with the spectacle.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Amelia was desperate
to try it herself.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:90%
She wrote in her diary.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:08.972 align:middle line:84%
"Finally, one day came
the chance to ride.

00:31:08.972 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:84%
By the time I got 200 or
300 feet off the ground,

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.027 align:middle line:90%
I knew I had to fly.

00:31:14.027 --> 00:31:16.710 align:middle line:90%


00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Flying was seen as
unfit for ladies

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.490 align:middle line:84%
but Amelia was no
ordinary young woman.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.040 align:middle line:84%
She took a job as a truck
driver to finance her pilot

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:90%
certificate.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Flying had become her passion.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Richard, that's
a little set of her career

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:90%
and how she got into flying.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:84%
But then she took
that ominous trip.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.650 align:middle line:10%
You're convinced,
of course, she crash

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:45.702 align:middle line:10%
landed somewhere near an
island, probably died there.

00:31:45.702 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Not on the island.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But not on the island.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.080 align:middle line:10%
Does she, through the
afterlife communications,

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:10%
talk to anybody about
what happened to her?

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, in
my case, all I can do

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:90%
is just what happened to me.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And in my case,
like I was saying,

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:03.354 align:middle line:84%
Patti Canova and I were
having lunch and she said,

00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:84%
you're doing a
film about Amelia--

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.478 align:middle line:84%
I had been working on
a film about Amelia

00:32:06.478 --> 00:32:08.240 align:middle line:84%
for about 20 years
at that point.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.531 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you're doing
a film about Amelia Earhart.

00:32:10.531 --> 00:32:11.760 align:middle line:90%
She wants to talk to you.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.241 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I thought,
did she look me up online?

00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I looked at my friend,
like, what is this?

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, what
am I being resistant for?

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:22.380 align:middle line:90%
OK, let me talk to her.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I spent two
hours interviewing her.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.190 align:middle line:90%
She told me new information.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.070 align:middle line:84%
She told me the name
of her lover, a woman,

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.670 align:middle line:84%
that she had an open
marriage with her husband.

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.250 align:middle line:84%
She told me how
she met this woman.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.140 align:middle line:84%
She told me that there was a
military nature of the flight

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:40.830 align:middle line:84%
but that she wasn't part of that
planning, et cetera, et cetera.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:84%
A lot of details,
details many of which

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I already knew because
of all my research.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.680 align:middle line:90%
I worked on the movie "Amelia."

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I was their digital
media curator,

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:90%
doing research and stuff.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, some years later,
I ran into channelingerik.com

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and I became friends with Dr.
Medhus, you've had on the show.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:03.636 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, you should
talk to Amelia sometime.

00:33:03.636 --> 00:33:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And she said, we're
talking to her next week.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.250 align:middle line:90%
So I submitted the questions.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To Amelia.

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: To Amelia
but I wasn't there.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's Dr. Medhus
asking the questions

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:84%
to Jamie Butler in Atlanta
and Amelia answering them.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.710 align:middle line:10%
And in the course
of the question,

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.790 align:middle line:10%
I threw in this
question, disguised--

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.172 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: To trick them, right?

00:33:22.172 --> 00:33:24.130 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Well, to see
if this was really her.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:24.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: To see if
this was real or not.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.380 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Yeah and
the question was,

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.470 align:middle line:10%
who was the love of your
life and was it a painter?

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:30.780 align:middle line:90%
No gender.

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody would
have known this, right?

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.575 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Yes, nobody
would have known this.

00:33:33.575 --> 00:33:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And she paused and said,
I hate to rewrite history

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:40.994 align:middle line:84%
but yes, the love of my life
was this woman who was a painter

00:33:40.994 --> 00:33:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and then went on to
describe this woman.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: When
you heard that answer--

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.458 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I was
like, oh, my gosh.

00:33:45.458 --> 00:33:48.010 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, at the
very end of the interview,

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:50.700 align:middle line:84%
when asked about her death,
she suddenly stopped and said,

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
talk about my death.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I think people who are
trying to dig for me,

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.520 align:middle line:90%
it's a waste of time.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm here on the flipside.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.080 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to waste
your time looking for me.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, well,
that's a message to me.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.575 align:middle line:90%
And so I kind of put it aside.

00:34:03.575 --> 00:34:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But when I was
writing this book,

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I was transcribing that session
and when I got to the end,

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.920 align:middle line:84%
she said-- I just
didn't hear it.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.120 align:middle line:84%
But the person who
supplied these questions,

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.312 align:middle line:84%
if he wants to talk to me
privately, I'll talk to him.

00:34:16.312 --> 00:34:17.145 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's you.

00:34:17.145 --> 00:34:18.280 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: That's me.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.469 align:middle line:10%
So now, I swear, a week
later, I get a call

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:22.489 align:middle line:10%
from Jennifer Shaffer.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer, she's here in
Manhattan Beach in Los Angeles.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:27.219 align:middle line:90%
She works with the FBI.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:90%
She does missing person cases.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.989 align:middle line:90%
She was just in Colorado.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:33.239 align:middle line:84%
They were just doing
a thing about her.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:35.698 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look, I'm not
that much into mediums

00:34:35.698 --> 00:34:37.739 align:middle line:84%
but how would you like to
work on the most famous

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:39.080 align:middle line:90%
missing person case in history?

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.199 align:middle line:90%
She was like, I'm in.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So I spent three hours
interviewing her,

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.422 align:middle line:90%
Amelia, asking where are you?

00:34:46.422 --> 00:34:48.130 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of
this conversation,

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Amelia said, well,
I died of dysentery.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.046 align:middle line:90%
Which is, I had been to Saipan.

00:34:57.046 --> 00:34:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I had already been
to the cell that she

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.980 align:middle line:84%
was-- so her plane
came down, Amelia told.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:90%
She landed it.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Japanese got her.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.909 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Japanese picked
her up, took her to Saipan.

00:35:04.909 --> 00:35:06.030 align:middle line:90%
She spent her time.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:08.319 align:middle line:84%
Fred Noonan was executed
for being a spy.

00:35:08.319 --> 00:35:10.110 align:middle line:84%
He was the one they
blamed for being a spy.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.070 align:middle line:90%
She was put in a cell.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.520 align:middle line:90%
She died of dysentery.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Her body was buried.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.423 align:middle line:90%
It was dug up by GIs.

00:35:15.423 --> 00:35:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Fred Goerner's book
comments on that.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.850 align:middle line:90%
And her plane was found.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Her briefcase was found.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed GIs
who found her plane.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.072 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed GIs, on camera,
who found her briefcase.

00:35:24.072 --> 00:35:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
ever have gotten

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.690 align:middle line:84%
this information had
you not worked with her

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:28.490 align:middle line:90%
and channeled her?

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, all that
stuff I had already gotten.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I had already interviewed
the GIs who found her plane,

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.094 align:middle line:90%
found her briefcase.

00:35:34.094 --> 00:35:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But this
corroborated it.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: This
corroborated it, absolutely.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't mention it to
anybody because it was like,

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.880 align:middle line:84%
how do you tell
people, oh, by the way,

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:90%
I heard this from herself.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But in this particular case,
I said, how did you die?

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.190 align:middle line:84%
This question that she wouldn't
answer with Jamie Butler.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:49.700 align:middle line:90%
And she said, dysentery.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Where's your body?

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.560 align:middle line:84%
She said, well,
two GIs dug me up.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.960 align:middle line:84%
She said, but they
only found my arm.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.760 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.259 align:middle line:84%
Do you mean they
only found her arm?

00:35:59.259 --> 00:36:00.470 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make sense.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And then 10 minutes
later, after I

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.680 align:middle line:84%
had done with this session,
my head's swimming, like,

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:90%
they only found her arm?

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They should have
all been intact, right?

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Exactly.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Also, I said, so what did
they do with your body?

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.430 align:middle line:90%
She said, they reburied me.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:15.570 align:middle line:90%
Who reburied you?

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Saipanese villagers
who didn't feel

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.639 align:middle line:90%
that my funeral was proper.

00:36:20.639 --> 00:36:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was appropriate.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So they reburied her
but they left behind her arm,

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.990 align:middle line:90%
I said, where?

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:30.106 align:middle line:84%
And Jennifer drew a map
of the exact location.

00:36:30.106 --> 00:36:32.627 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jennifer's never been
there but I had just been there.

00:36:32.627 --> 00:36:33.710 align:middle line:10%
So when she drew the map--

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:34.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And it was accurate.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.930 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: I knew exactly
what she was pointing to.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I said, you mean your
body's still there?

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.990 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes after
this conversation,

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I get a call from a
guy, a former NTSB guy,

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.930 align:middle line:84%
who had seen documents,
classified information,

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.870 align:middle line:84%
somebody else's book-- I don't
want to mention it because he's

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.730 align:middle line:84%
going to reveal it-- but
ultimately, it corroborated

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:56.180 align:middle line:90%
everything that I've said.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
Rich, everything

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.660 align:middle line:84%
is true except when
they dug up her body,

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.259 align:middle line:90%
they only found her arm.

00:37:02.259 --> 00:37:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You already knew that.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: 10 minutes
after I had heard it

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:90%
from Amelia herself.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is a great story.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:08.513 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: What's
the oddness of that?

00:37:08.513 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So since then, I've
corroborated that.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:14.280 align:middle line:84%
"Chicago Tribune," 1977, they
interviewed those two guys who

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.710 align:middle line:84%
dug her up and
they said, we only

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.440 align:middle line:84%
found a partial rib
cage and an arm.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So Amelia left the rib cage
part out but I understood

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.520 align:middle line:90%
what she was telling me.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.353 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Communications
from the other side.

00:37:24.353 --> 00:37:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I want to read a couple
email questions in for you.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.940 align:middle line:10%
Nancy from Charlotte,
North Carolina.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.610 align:middle line:10%
Do you believe that we can all
find peace in the afterlife

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:35.130 align:middle line:10%
despite our faults
on this planet?

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:36.604 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
it's in the data.

00:37:36.604 --> 00:37:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And a matter of belief is
personal for every person.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:45.010 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is, that's
reflected in the data.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:49.240 align:middle line:84%
That ultimately, when we
get back to the other side,

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.010 align:middle line:84%
we find complete peace and
we see that connectedness

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:54.000 align:middle line:90%
between all people.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sandra, Washington DC.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Should we be afraid
of the afterlife?

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, Sandra, what
are you trying to tell us?

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Afraid of the afterlife,
in the sense of,

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.310 align:middle line:84%
look, if you come here
and don't do things

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:10.400 align:middle line:84%
that you signed up to do
and don't achieve the things

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.330 align:middle line:84%
you signed up to achieve,
when you get back,

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:16.490 align:middle line:84%
you meet up with your soul
mates and your spirit guides

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.590 align:middle line:90%
and they go, what happened?

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:22.790 align:middle line:90%
And you feel the terrible loss.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.960 align:middle line:90%
You feel the people you've hurt.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.990 align:middle line:84%
You re-experience all
of that negativity

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:32.240 align:middle line:84%
that you've engendered but from
every person's point of view.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And imagine how
difficult that is.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying that people
don't experience the negativity

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:39.020 align:middle line:90%
they engender here.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.120 align:middle line:84%
They do, according
to the reports.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.820 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
maybe months, years

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.630 align:middle line:84%
after that, you get back to
your soul group and they go,

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.505 align:middle line:90%
look, we love you.

00:38:49.505 --> 00:38:51.720 align:middle line:84%
You didn't do what you
were going to set out to do

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.840 align:middle line:90%
but it's OK, man.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.000 align:middle line:90%
You've screwed up before.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.010 align:middle line:90%
We're going to fix it this time.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what's
reflected in the book.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you sure that
the existence of the afterlife

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.990 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely out there?

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, it's
in the data, like I say.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.940 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't, I would
doubt it myself.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:12.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm a skeptic.

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Skeptic means
somebody who doesn't

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.080 align:middle line:84%
believe in the prevailing
school of thought.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But wants proof of it.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, and
ultimately, if you

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.270 align:middle line:84%
allow yourself to
just look at the data,

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:25.540 align:middle line:84%
what science asks us to
do is put data on a table.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:29.140 align:middle line:84%
If you can replicate
it and it's consistent,

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:90%
then it becomes data.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So research--
ultimately, 35 people

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.800 align:middle line:84%
have said precisely the same
things that I've filmed.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.250 align:middle line:84%
7,000 people that
Newton had cases with.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:42.050 align:middle line:90%
2,000 at--

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They all
say the same thing.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:44.695 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: They all
say the same thing.

00:39:44.695 --> 00:39:45.770 align:middle line:90%
We don't die.

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So if I interviewed somebody,
Christopher Hitchens,

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:51.040 align:middle line:90%
let's say, on the flipside.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm
not-- I've dissolved.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm here.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Or not,
whatever he says.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's just
one point of view.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.230 align:middle line:10%
Just like "The Tibetan Book of
the Dead," one monk wrote that.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.909 align:middle line:84%
But if you get 7,000 monks
to say the same thing,

00:40:04.909 --> 00:40:06.700 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
get a different story.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Hacking
the Afterlife," where

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:90%
do people get the book, Rich?

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.330 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Right now,
it's on-- it's exclusively

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:14.510 align:middle line:10%
on Amazon Kindle and it's on
Audible starting this week.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can hear my
dulcet tones telling you

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.300 align:middle line:90%
all about this research.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on the program.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: I love you.

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love you, too.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.925 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: I love you more.

00:40:22.925 --> 00:40:26.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Look, I'm in no
rush to get to the other side

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.930 align:middle line:10%
but when it happens,
I'll be ready.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.040 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
