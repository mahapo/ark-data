An old fiend of mine

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:30.531 align:middle line:84%
who investigates UFO cases
worldwide is with us James Fox,

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.266 align:middle line:90%
documentary film maker.

you again my friend.

I wish you-- How
did you get involved

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:44.611 align:middle line:84%
in this true obsession
with UFO's?

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:47.447 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: I really wanted
to know the truth.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:50.584 align:middle line:84%
When a good friend of mine
started talking about Roswell

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:53.887 align:middle line:84%
which was in the very
early 90s, I honestly felt

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.589 align:middle line:90%
that he had lost his mind.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.958 align:middle line:84%
And-- But he's a real
good friend and then,

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.794 align:middle line:84%
I was working doing video
production in San Francisco,

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:03.463 align:middle line:84%
doing PSAs, Public
Service Announcements.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:05.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: And one of the guys
that really respected on the--

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.467 align:middle line:84%
on the job site was
like, oh yeah,

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.002 align:middle line:84%
Roswell really did
actually happen.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.971 align:middle line:84%
And he confirmed a bunch of
stuff for me and I thought oh.

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:90%
So, I started looking into it

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.509 align:middle line:84%
and here I am all these years
later of still wanting to get

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:84%
to the truth and I feel like
I'm getting closer to the truth.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.115 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is a more elusive
than I expected it to be.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:25.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Is it like one
step forward, two steps back?

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: One step
forward, ten steps back.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That much.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:28.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Well yeah.

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:29.656 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's frustrating.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Well it is and it isn't.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.259 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really feel
like I'm getting closer

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.529 align:middle line:84%
to knowing what the
government knows.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:38.598 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the government
knows the real and they have

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.301 align:middle line:84%
for quite some time as early
back as the aspen

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.337 align:middle line:90%
of the situation in '48.

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:46.673 align:middle line:84%
But I'm beginning to believe,
and some people are going

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:48.041 align:middle line:84%
to hate me for saying
this, that's--

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.711 align:middle line:84%
it's more a question of what
the government doesn't know--

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:51.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Doesn't know.

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:53.213 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: -- as opposed to
what they know is reasons

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:56.850 align:middle line:84%
for secrecy 'cause you can't
let the cat out of the bag

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.821 align:middle line:84%
and not have its going to open
up a flood gate of inquiries.

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:01.655 align:middle line:90%
Could you imagine?

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:02.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's true.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:03.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Admitting
that their real

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and then not having
all the answers.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.659 align:middle line:90%
I mean we don't really know.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You can't-- not
being able to back it up.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:07.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Yeah.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And tell if
it's dangerous or not.

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:10.464 align:middle line:90%
Are they taking us?

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.032 align:middle line:90%
Are they eating us?

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:15.535 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what and your right
I think people would panic.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:16.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, you
know, I talked to a--

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:20.007 align:middle line:84%
I've never addressed
the issue of abductions

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:21.308 align:middle line:90%
in any of my documentaries.

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:21.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I've noticed that.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:22.442 align:middle line:90%
I've noticed that.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, only because
I really feel like--

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:26.313 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that I
don't believe it happening.

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:28.347 align:middle line:84%
As far as I've gone
is with Travis Walton.

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.817 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't leave-- I don't
believe they are happening

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.886 align:middle line:84%
'cause they I think they
probably are happening.

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:35.155 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine
that they are happening,

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.158 align:middle line:84%
that's certainly one
plausible reason for secrecy.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Absolutely.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Can you imagine
the government disclosing

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:42.195 align:middle line:84%
that information to
the general public.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:43.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:44.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: You know
that's-that's terrifying.

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:45.932 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And whatever they
are doing genetically altering

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.668 align:middle line:90%
people, hybrids, who knows.

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:48.802 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:50.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, absolutely
one of the top reasons

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.071 align:middle line:90%
for secrecy in that case.

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But going back to
why I don't cover it.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.409 align:middle line:84%
Not to say that I'm
getting closer

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.977 align:middle line:90%
with this next production "701."

00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:58.311 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get even closer.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to close
encounters of the third kind.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.149 align:middle line:90%
We have a lot of amazing cases

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:03.784 align:middle line:84%
that were getting
and delve into.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:08.188 align:middle line:84%
But because I feel like,
let's first establish the fact

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:11.458 align:middle line:84%
to the mainstream that a
phenomenon is taking place.

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:12.592 align:middle line:90%
It's global.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:15.162 align:middle line:84%
It's not anecdotal
evidence based on.

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:17.964 align:middle line:90%
It's got real hard evidence--

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:19.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: -- and a
preponderance of hard evidence.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.036 align:middle line:84%
And, so let's-- let's
look-- sorry.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.205 align:middle line:84%
Let's let the public
get use to that first

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.474 align:middle line:84%
and then we could take it a
step further and possibly go

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:28.975 align:middle line:90%
into some of that other stuff.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And you're
right about mainstream.

00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:34.414 align:middle line:84%
I mean, historically they
have looked at UFOs stories

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:39.719 align:middle line:84%
as the laughable kicker in
a newscast or the "ha, ha."

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.621 align:middle line:90%
Then, you know, and I have been

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:84%
in the news business,
James, a long time.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.095 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like they started
getting serious during the J.

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:49.362 align:middle line:90%
Allen Hynek days.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:52.232 align:middle line:84%
And Hynek of course as you
know was the consultant

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.669 align:middle line:84%
to Project Blue Book
which our government had.

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.238 align:middle line:84%
You know, he came out with
his Swamp Gas Theory back

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.841 align:middle line:84%
in the late 60s which
haunted him.

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:02.375 align:middle line:90%
But he was a believer.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:05.979 align:middle line:84%
But people like that
started taking this very,

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.781 align:middle line:90%
very seriously.

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:11.184 align:middle line:84%
I think today mainstream
though it doesn't cover this

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:90%
extensively as it should,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.757 align:middle line:84%
I think they are a little more
serious than they use to be.

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:18.058 align:middle line:90%
Do you have that feeling?

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:19.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Absolutely.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:22.395 align:middle line:84%
Yes I do. And I remember
being on set with Larry King

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.331 align:middle line:84%
and it was the best
panel we ever put on.

00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:25.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I was with
you on one of them.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:26.633 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: You were with
us on one of them.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:29.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: And then we did this
was-- this was unprecedented.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
We did a show, a one hour long
show that was just so precarious

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.609 align:middle line:84%
and so tenuous putting
the whole thing together.

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:38.345 align:middle line:84%
I'd bore your listeners, your
viewers for hours talking

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:39.713 align:middle line:90%
about the logistics behind it.

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:41.681 align:middle line:84%
But we did a show where they
allowed me to pick everybody.

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.116 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes, I remember that.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.484 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: OK?

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:46.853 align:middle line:84%
And then, they said well we
want-- we have to have a skeptic

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:49.189 align:middle line:84%
but we won't have him on till
the last part of the show.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.225 align:middle line:84%
So we-- we had some
of the top people.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Was it Shermer?

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:54.394 align:middle line:90%
Was he the skeptic?

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:55.662 align:middle line:90%
Michael Shermer?

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: It was either
Michael Shermer that time

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.931 align:middle line:90%
or this other guy named McGaha.

00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:59.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:00.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, at least
Shermer is very intelligent,

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:01.668 align:middle line:90%
a very intelligent person.

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:06.206 align:middle line:84%
McGaha was just that--
anyway, no comment.

00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:09.075 align:middle line:84%
We went to commercial break
probably the second time.

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:11.645 align:middle line:84%
And we had-- and we
had a satellite feed

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:12.813 align:middle line:90%
in with Nick Pope.

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:13.947 align:middle line:90%
And we had a satellite feed

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:15.882 align:middle line:84%
in with Callahan,
the former FAA guy.

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:17.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: All the heavy
hitters in morphology.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: We had people
from the Bentwater's case.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:20.587 align:middle line:90%
We have the Colonel.

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:22.923 align:middle line:90%
We had Governor Symington.

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:24.724 align:middle line:84%
And Larry went to
commercial break.

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And Larry kind of sat there
and he was, he was, "Wow,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.164 align:middle line:84%
this stuff's-- this
stuff's real isn't it?"

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.567 align:middle line:84%
And every one was trying to
say, yes and the Colonel,

00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:36.403 align:middle line:84%
Deputy Base Commander at
Bentwater's yes, yes it is.

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:38.471 align:middle line:84%
And the guy who touched
the UFO yeah.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.507 align:middle line:84%
Yeah it is, you know
and Larry just sat there

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.175 align:middle line:84%
with this just sort of
look on his face like wow,

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.576 align:middle line:84%
this one slipped
between the cracks.

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:44.211 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:45.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: You know.

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:46.313 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He used
to do UFO stories

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:49.082 align:middle line:84%
when he was doing
mutual radio show.

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:50.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Right.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And then,
once he got into CNN,

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:56.456 align:middle line:84%
he really got interested in
this probably because of you.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:06:01.361 align:middle line:84%
It's a shame he's gone in
that we lost in this business,

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:06.866 align:middle line:84%
a champion on a network level
who really was into the genre.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.002 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is doing that
anymore, James.

00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:12.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: True, but Larry did say
to me at his house about a year

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:16.276 align:middle line:84%
and half ago, "James, if you
get that piece of evidence

00:06:16.276 --> 00:06:18.745 align:middle line:84%
that we're all waiting
for, you come to me first."

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:19.813 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He wants it still.

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:20.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: And I'll--
I'll make sure it gets

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:21.982 align:middle line:90%
out there in the public eye.

00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:23.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:24.618 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: So we are pursuing
that evidence right now

00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:26.386 align:middle line:84%
which I'm very, very
excited about it.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.322 align:middle line:84%
It's a-- It's been sitting
in vault for 40 years

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:32.192 align:middle line:84%
and were getting close to
getting our hands on it.

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:34.927 align:middle line:84%
But the guys is really-- he
thinks the government is going

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:35.962 align:middle line:90%
to kind of come after him.

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:38.598 align:middle line:84%
He's not sure and
he is a wealthy guy.

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:40.934 align:middle line:84%
And his like why I
should I take the risk.

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:43.937 align:middle line:84%
But its official evidence and
I'm doing everything I can

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:45.205 align:middle line:84%
in my power to get
my hands on it.

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:45.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: To get that.

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:46.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Yes.

00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Can you?

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: I think it's
very probable, yes.

00:06:48.642 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What do you
think it would say?

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: I think it would
say beyond of a shadow

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.781 align:middle line:84%
of a doubt these things are
real and then it's not us

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:55.882 align:middle line:90%
and official evidence.

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:57.751 align:middle line:84%
It's something from
the civilians.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:01.988 align:middle line:84%
This came from Air Force stuff
and it was given to these people

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:90%
by people in the Air Force.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well you know when
you look at this universe

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:08.395 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that there's
a vastness now of earth

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:13.266 align:middle line:84%
like planets and we're
4.5 billion years old

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:17.938 align:middle line:84%
in a universe that's almost 14
billion years old assuming they

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:22.208 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to jump start
way before we do, my gosh,

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.209 align:middle line:90%
they've got the technology.

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:23.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: That true.

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:25.078 align:middle line:90%
They've been there.

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:26.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They've come
up with a way to do this.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, think about a
million years advance from us,

00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:29.816 align:middle line:90%
think about ten million years.

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:31.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Yeah, at our level--
at our level of progression--

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:32.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Yeah.

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:33.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Add a million
years to that,

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:84%
God knows what we'll be doing
a million years from now.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what computers--
we may not even have computers.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.996 align:middle line:84%
They maybe in our
heads, who knows?

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:44.531 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Oh no, I mean,
yeah when you think

00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:47.233 align:middle line:84%
about it a hundred years what
we've done and a hundred years.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:49.169 align:middle line:84%
I was actually just the
other day at a wedding party

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:51.237 align:middle line:84%
with a woman sitting next to
me was a hundred years old

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.972 align:middle line:90%
and she was actually 101.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.174 align:middle line:84%
She was talking about
what life was

00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:55.108 align:middle line:84%
like when she grew
up as a child.

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:56.209 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Isn't that amazing?

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.577 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Absolutely unbelievable.

00:07:57.577 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
People just forget so quickly
how much things have changed

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.781 align:middle line:90%
in a hundred years.

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:04.317 align:middle line:84%
This woman had a crystal clear
memory and she was telling me,

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.186 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't any
roads when I grew up.

00:08:06.186 --> 00:08:08.688 align:middle line:84%
And she said you had to get
a train or a boat to get

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:10.357 align:middle line:84%
from one location to
the next location.

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:13.226 align:middle line:84%
And we were barely flying
when this thing was born.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:16.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, James
I was born in 1950.

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:20.033 align:middle line:84%
The Civil War was less
than a hundred years old

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:24.037 align:middle line:84%
which is nothing in
time, nothing considering

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:29.642 align:middle line:84%
that Kennedy, it's been 60
years-- 50 years, I mean,

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:33.113 align:middle line:84%
time just flies by so I mean
this is all possible this--

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:37.117 align:middle line:84%
this ability to jumpstart
by a hundred years,

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:84%
two hundred years,
things can happen.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.555 align:middle line:84%
Technology could
be unbelievable.

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:45.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: I-- We just did an
interview with Story Musgrave.

00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:46.926 align:middle line:84%
He's one of NASA's
finest astronauts.

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:48.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Great astronaut.

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:50.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Wonderful man
and he gave-- you could--

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I could always gauge the level
of success with an interview

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.735 align:middle line:84%
by there're people in room
and the production staff,

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.370 align:middle line:84%
there's lighting guys,
there's audio guys,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.305 align:middle line:84%
you could hear a pin drop
during this interview.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:03.076 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about like, you
know, how far we've progressed.

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:05.578 align:middle line:84%
What it was like to be in space
and the fact that the level

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:09.182 align:middle line:84%
of conviction this man
has that life is teeming.

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:11.785 align:middle line:84%
The universe is teeming
with life.

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:13.286 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's more
advanced than us.

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:15.255 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are going
around in spaceships.

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:17.023 align:middle line:90%
There's just zero-- zero doubt.

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:19.392 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, why
do you think, you know--

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.227 align:middle line:84%
why do you think they
are not just landing

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.329 align:middle line:84%
and making themselves,
you know, known.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:24.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Know.

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:25.598 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: And he is
like, you know,

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:27.467 align:middle line:84%
James there were 35 wars just
last week alone, you know,

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:31.638 align:middle line:84%
we are a very hostile,
very aggressive species.

00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:34.641 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps maybe once
we could come to terms

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:37.777 align:middle line:84%
with that we might start
establishing contact.

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:39.512 align:middle line:90%
But if was interesting that he--

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:41.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, if I were
an advanced E.T. race,

00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want to
inter mingle with us.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.187 align:middle line:84%
I mean I would look at the same
thing going that's all these

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:48.855 align:middle line:90%
people is kill each other.

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:50.423 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:51.591 align:middle line:90%
That could be a reason.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.259 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
Hybridization Program,

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.694 align:middle line:84%
the Abduction Program which
of course you don't touch.

00:09:54.694 --> 00:10:02.702 align:middle line:84%
But wouldn't it be interesting
if they are hybriding aliens

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:06.873 align:middle line:84%
with humans in order to
replace this killing machine

00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:10.443 align:middle line:84%
that we have on earth
which would be us

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.545 align:middle line:84%
with a more loving
type creature.

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:16.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: There's a
very well-known case--

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:18.051 align:middle line:84%
well not that well known
in the UFO community.

00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
But a pretty -- pretty
amazing case Ruwa, Zimbabwe,

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.191 align:middle line:84%
1994 and there were
200 school children

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:29.462 align:middle line:84%
and they had a saucer
land and actually a couple

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.799 align:middle line:84%
of smaller saucers which I
know sounds outrageous at 10:30

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.702 align:middle line:84%
in the morning in
Ruwa, Zimbabwe in 1994

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
where you had 200
school children

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.771 align:middle line:90%
out in the field playing --

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:39.973 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Witnessing this.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: We don't know
exactly how witness there

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:44.477 align:middle line:84%
but there were 200 school
children in the field.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.013 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say,
oh it was 64 witnesses.

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:48.681 align:middle line:84%
No, it was a lot more
than 64 witnesses.

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:50.984 align:middle line:84%
The only reason why the
number 64 comes from is

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.685 align:middle line:84%
that there were 64 drawings
that correlated to that.

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:55.522 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And were
they all similar?

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:56.689 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Oh yeah, but my point --

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That'll
tell you something.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: My point-- my point was

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:01.361 align:middle line:84%
that the telepathic
communications these kids claim

00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:04.764 align:middle line:84%
to have had with these
beings was that we need to--

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
it's very-- it's one of
destruction on the planet

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.236 align:middle line:84%
and that we need to be better
stewards on the planet.

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:13.273 align:middle line:84%
We need to take care not get
technologed was the

00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:15.375 align:middle line:90%
word one the children used.

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:16.743 align:middle line:90%
Technologed, is a new word.

00:11:16.743 --> 00:11:18.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: A new word.

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:19.345 align:middle line:90%
Hey, it works.

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:21.047 align:middle line:90%
I've used words like that.

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:21.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: I know.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:22.882 align:middle line:90%
Strategery.

00:11:22.882 --> 00:11:24.217 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:11:24.217 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, so you know,
maybe they were given a message.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.924 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I don't want
people to take my position

00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:34.294 align:middle line:84%
from the wrong position
that I don't believe a lot

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:36.162 align:middle line:84%
of the accounts that
I've-I've talked

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to with alleged abduction people
or the hybridization process

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.201 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:44.737 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like it's a--
it's a hot potato issue.

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:47.206 align:middle line:84%
And unless you have very
solid evidence to back it

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:49.909 align:middle line:84%
up its difficult to
present that in mainstream

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:51.844 align:middle line:84%
because we are already
laughed at when were talking

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.846 align:middle line:84%
about structured craft
of unknown origin.

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:54.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:56.316 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Whizzing
around with impunity.

00:11:56.316 --> 00:11:57.684 align:middle line:84%
Take it a step further and it'd
be like the aliens are coming

00:11:57.684 --> 00:11:59.519 align:middle line:84%
and their pulling me out of
bed and something's like whoa,

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:90%
let's go one step at a time.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, and it doesn't
help when you see a picture

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:05.925 align:middle line:84%
of an alien shaking hands
with Bill Clinton, you know.

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: On the cover
of some tabloid--

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.728 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Yeah, on the
cover of some tabloid.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:09.996 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't work.

00:12:09.996 --> 00:12:13.199 align:middle line:84%
The Zimbabwe case what did
they describe these kids?

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:14.334 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Unbelievable.

00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:15.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And is this on
the documentary "701."

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:16.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Oh yes.

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: The new one.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.171 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Oh yes.

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:19.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Which we'll
talk about in a sec.

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:20.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: I get Goosebumps
talking about this one.

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:21.641 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Tell me
about this one.

00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:27.113 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Well I thought that, you
know, it was somewhat ambiguous.

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:28.815 align:middle line:84%
I thought that these
school children kind of--

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:30.016 align:middle line:90%
like looked between the tree --

00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:31.251 align:middle line:84%
You know I didn't
really know the details

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.552 align:middle line:90%
of it quite honestly.

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:33.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Like maybe it was
drone or something, right?

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:34.988 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Something far
off in the distance.

00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:36.723 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was some
entity seen.

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:39.025 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
quite, you know, uh-uh.

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:42.895 align:middle line:84%
We flew four of the witnesses
out from different parts

00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:45.465 align:middle line:84%
of the world just a couple
of weeks ago in Los Angeles.

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:46.833 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I get a tingly
talking about this.

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's OK.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.334 align:middle line:90%
It's a great story.

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:49.268 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: It's so unbelievable.

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:50.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I can't
wait to hear it.

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:51.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: These-- Emily, Emma,

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:54.107 align:middle line:90%
Selma and Liesel

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And how
old are they now?

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: They are-- and
they are-- just turning 30.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:04.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, and incredibly
articulate and intelligent

00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:06.886 align:middle line:84%
and one of them hadn't
even told her husband

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:08.955 align:middle line:84%
of five years about
the incident.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.323 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Wow.

00:13:10.323 --> 00:13:11.991 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, they came out
and I said, well why did you--

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:84%
why did you women
decide, you know, to come

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.528 align:middle line:90%
and participate in our project?

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Why-- why now?

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.199 align:middle line:84%
They said we really felt it
was time when we reached out.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.502 align:middle line:84%
This gentlemen Randall Nickerson
actually helped us coordinate

00:13:22.502 --> 00:13:23.736 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing.

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:28.675 align:middle line:84%
But-- but any case these
school children the contact,

00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:31.678 align:middle line:84%
one of the women said,
I could have reached out

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:32.545 align:middle line:90%
and touched the alien.

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:33.846 align:middle line:90%
It was right there.

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:36.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They-- they
saw a physical being?

00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:37.684 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Absolutely,
standing right here.

00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:39.852 align:middle line:84%
She said, "I could of
reached and touched it"

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:40.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What did
they describe,

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.321 align:middle line:90%
the typical alien gray?

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:46.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: She said that they
eyes were-- were mesmerizing,

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:49.362 align:middle line:84%
that hypnotizing, that the
eyes it was all about the eyes.

00:13:49.362 --> 00:13:51.564 align:middle line:84%
All the children
talked about the eyes.

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:54.701 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot tell you the
emotional state for these women

00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:56.169 align:middle line:90%
to talk about this encounter.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:56.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.037 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: The eyes.

00:13:58.037 --> 00:13:59.872 align:middle line:84%
They kept saying these
big eyes, you know.

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Big eyes.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: And little
noses, slit for mouths.

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:04.477 align:middle line:84%
Some of them said there
was maybe some black--

00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:06.946 align:middle line:84%
it was like a black
tight fitting suit on.

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:09.782 align:middle line:84%
But that these-- that
they were right there.

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:11.951 align:middle line:84%
And-- and one of
the girls all right,

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:14.487 align:middle line:90%
so they have this big field.

00:14:14.487 --> 00:14:16.723 align:middle line:84%
There's a clearly
defined perimeter

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:19.025 align:middle line:84%
of where the children are
not allowed to go any further

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:84%
in the Africa 'cause they said
they were hunted dangerous

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.195 align:middle line:90%
snakes and spiders.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.262 align:middle line:90%
And so you don't--

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:24.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Animals,
grab them and you know.

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:25.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Yeah.

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:26.933 align:middle line:84%
You don't go beyond
these-- these logs.

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:27.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:28.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: These log
have the field.

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:29.635 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:31.404 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Even close to the logs
would be pretty bad I think,

00:14:31.404 --> 00:14:32.538 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:33.906 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, well one
of the girls was saying

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:37.009 align:middle line:84%
that she was skipping along
the log as she did, you know,

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.144 align:middle line:90%
kind of like right on the edge

00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:39.912 align:middle line:84%
of where she's allowed
to go and not go.

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: And she's skipping along
the top of these logs going

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:42.849 align:middle line:90%
from one log to the next.

00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:44.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Balancing herself.

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:45.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: And she looks over
on the left and there was one

00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:47.920 align:middle line:84%
of them sort of skipping
along jovially next to her.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: With her.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:50.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: With her.

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:51.491 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what
these creatures was.

00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:54.293 align:middle line:84%
But I really-- that
image of, you know,

00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:56.763 align:middle line:84%
these innocent children
and the innocence

00:14:56.763 --> 00:14:58.931 align:middle line:84%
of whoever these beings were
or wherever they came from.

00:14:58.931 --> 00:14:59.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Having nothing fun.

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:01.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: The whole
thing was benign.

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.069 align:middle line:90%
It was-- there was no threat.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.605 align:middle line:90%
There was no feeling of danger.

00:15:05.605 --> 00:15:08.407 align:middle line:84%
It was this wonderful
little encounter, right?

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:12.779 align:middle line:84%
And then the direct, you
know, face to face contact

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:16.048 align:middle line:84%
and communication with these
beings there was a feeling of--

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:17.617 align:middle line:90%
of calmness.

00:15:17.617 --> 00:15:18.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: And-- And comfort
and security and, you know,

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.956 align:middle line:84%
there was enough-- they
said that the only thing

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:27.059 align:middle line:84%
that was unpleasant about
the experience was the adults

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:28.895 align:middle line:90%
reaction to the whole thing.

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:31.397 align:middle line:84%
And then-- And then
trying to, you know,

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:84%
the media they said
they felt that--

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
that they were used and that
they were just, you know,

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.872 align:middle line:84%
used to extract as much
information about this

00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:43.643 align:middle line:84%
as possible and that
at the end of the day,

00:15:43.643 --> 00:15:46.579 align:middle line:84%
there were never really
given any therapy on how

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:48.815 align:middle line:84%
to process what they
had experienced.

00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:49.982 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:50.783 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They just left them.

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:51.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: They just left them.

00:15:51.918 --> 00:15:53.319 align:middle line:84%
They just extracted what
they want out of them

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:56.989 align:middle line:84%
and left the children so here we
are nearly 20 years later and--

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:58.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are they
affected by this?

00:15:58.391 --> 00:15:59.759 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Profoundly.

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:02.461 align:middle line:90%
Profoundly affected by this.

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:03.229 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I mean--

00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:03.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I would be too.

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:05.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Could you imagine?

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:08.434 align:middle line:84%
I mean most UFO encounters
that we hear about is like oh,

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.536 align:middle line:84%
I saw this light off from
distance or I saw this--

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:11.237 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:16:11.237 --> 00:16:12.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: We're dealing

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:13.306 align:middle line:84%
with a close encounter
of the third kind.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- and
it was undeniable.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why do you think these
occupants made themselves known

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:90%
to these kids?

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.054 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: OK, so and there
were no adults present.

00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:34.126 align:middle line:84%
And when the school bell
rang, the encounter ended.

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:35.228 align:middle line:90%
So as soon as the adults--

00:16:35.228 --> 00:16:37.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So they
knew something, right?

00:16:37.063 --> 00:16:38.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: They must
have known something

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.733 align:middle line:84%
and there were sightings
in the area.

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:41.968 align:middle line:90%
There were sightings actually.

00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:45.037 align:middle line:84%
There's a video footage
that Randall Nickerson shot

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:46.672 align:middle line:84%
of a BBC correspondent
that talked

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:50.243 align:middle line:84%
about he was a BBC guy Ruwa,
Zimbabwe at the time talked

00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:53.212 align:middle line:84%
about getting phone calls
from the local Air Force

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:55.114 align:middle line:90%
or local, sorry, airport.

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:56.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: During the
same time period?

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:58.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: During the same
time period of encounters.

00:16:58.251 --> 00:16:59.552 align:middle line:84%
There was one actually
blocking the air.

00:16:59.552 --> 00:17:01.954 align:middle line:84%
There was a UFO apparently
blocking the airport.

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:06.659 align:middle line:84%
So there was UFO activity in the
area prior to this happening.

00:17:06.659 --> 00:17:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe these beings,
extraterrestrials,

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:13.666 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call them
picked the school children

00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:17.136 align:middle line:84%
because of the innocence
and because of-- of not--

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:20.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Maybe-- It just wanted
to see how they reacted maybe.

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:21.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Well they could
determine a threat.

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:22.909 align:middle line:90%
I think that, you know,

00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:25.411 align:middle line:84%
they would be the most
unjaded of all us.

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:26.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: You know having
no opinion whatsoever

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.916 align:middle line:84%
and having no position
whatsoever.

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:32.151 align:middle line:84%
And it was the whole thing
it was very innocent.

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:36.188 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting that
the beings were relaying these

00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:38.124 align:middle line:90%
messages into these children.

00:17:38.124 --> 00:17:39.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they
didn't hurt anybody.

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:40.059 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: They didn't hurt anyone.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.794 align:middle line:90%
They didn't take any one.

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:44.997 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to warn us
of our behavior on the planet.

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating, fascinating stuff.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Did the
kids see the craft?

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yes, they
all saw the craft.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:51.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What did
they describe?

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:52.738 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: They said it was a--

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:56.175 align:middle line:84%
none of them said
disc or flying saucer.

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.213 align:middle line:84%
They just said plate or made
the description like this,

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:03.215 align:middle line:84%
a little bubble at the
top, lights around it.

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:05.718 align:middle line:84%
I think one of them-- there
was one very large craft

00:18:05.718 --> 00:18:09.322 align:middle line:84%
about the size of a large house
and then three smaller crafts

00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:10.389 align:middle line:90%
and there was tall grass--

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:11.524 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The mother
ship was the there.

00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: There was taller
grass and so they said,

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.129 align:middle line:84%
well we weren't sure if the
craft was just hovering right

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:18.497 align:middle line:84%
above the ground or
it was on the ground

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:19.565 align:middle line:90%
because there was tall grass.

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:20.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they
were all saying this.

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:21.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Everyone
one of them, yeah.

00:18:21.734 --> 00:18:25.004 align:middle line:84%
And I said well how
far away was the craft?

00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:28.341 align:middle line:84%
Well I could have hit
with a rock, easily.

00:18:28.341 --> 00:18:29.642 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so the craft
was right there

00:18:29.642 --> 00:18:30.509 align:middle line:90%
and the beings were right there.

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:32.178 align:middle line:90%
And there were several beings.

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:33.846 align:middle line:84%
There was at least
two and possibly more.

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:35.748 align:middle line:84%
And there were some that
stayed back at the craft

00:18:35.748 --> 00:18:37.116 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
other's that came up.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.217 align:middle line:84%
And here's another thing
that's very interesting--

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:39.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's
is so fascinating.

00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:41.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Is that the beings came
right up to the logs knowing

00:18:41.387 --> 00:18:43.456 align:middle line:84%
that was the defining,
you know--

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.457 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah, they knew this.

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yes, the
beings came at the logs

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.028 align:middle line:84%
and the children came
right at the logs.

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
But no, the beings didn't
come into their territory

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.466 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't go into
the restricted territory.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.234 align:middle line:84%
They were right there and some
of the children were standing

00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:84%
on the logs and the creatures
were right in front of them.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they got
in and then left, huh?

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:01.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: And then the whole--

00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:03.175 align:middle line:84%
but the whole thing
lasted like 15 minutes.

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:04.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Which is a long time.

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Which is a very long
time, very, very long time, yes.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.883 align:middle line:84%
And like I said it was a--
it was an amazing encounter

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:14.687 align:middle line:84%
and we got a bunch of new
details on the case from these--

00:19:14.687 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:84%
from the brave women
that are coming forward

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.358 align:middle line:90%
and talking about this case.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:22.728 align:middle line:84%
Could you imagine not telling
your husband of five years?

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:23.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why?

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:24.497 align:middle line:90%
Was she afraid?

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:25.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Just afraid
of their reaction.

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.667 align:middle line:90%
She said it's not the incident.

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.001 align:middle line:90%
The incident was amazing.

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:31.937 align:middle line:84%
I feel privileged to have had
that experience in my life

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:33.973 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that
their out there,

00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:35.474 align:middle line:90%
knowing this stuff is real.

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:36.842 align:middle line:90%
They're privileged.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Did you interview
them all together as a group?

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: I guess-- that's a
very good point because I said,

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.516 align:middle line:84%
I kept saying guys,
guys we really--

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:44.784 align:middle line:84%
we should really
shoot this in a way

00:19:44.784 --> 00:19:46.986 align:middle line:84%
where maybe we shouldn't
have all of them in the room

00:19:46.986 --> 00:19:49.755 align:middle line:84%
at the same time for their
first meeting in 20 years.

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.624 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what why
don't we do the first part

00:19:51.624 --> 00:19:52.792 align:middle line:84%
of the interview 'cause
we had limited time.

00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:54.226 align:middle line:84%
We had a full day to
shoot Ruwa, Zimbabwe case.

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:55.428 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:19:55.428 --> 00:19:57.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Why don't we put
the girls around the table

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:58.531 align:middle line:90%
and I'll be there with them.

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.933 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give them
notepads, drawing paper

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:03.035 align:middle line:84%
and let's just talk
about a little bit

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:05.137 align:middle line:84%
about their experience and
have them draw things out

00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:06.972 align:middle line:84%
and have them exchange
information.

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:11.677 align:middle line:84%
And as it turned out, there were
two women, it was either Liesel

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:15.848 align:middle line:84%
and Salma or Emma and Emily,
sorry, I get the order right.

00:20:15.848 --> 00:20:18.484 align:middle line:84%
But it just so-- it just so
happens completely randomly

00:20:18.484 --> 00:20:21.253 align:middle line:84%
that they were together that
were standing right next

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:23.789 align:middle line:84%
to each other during
the encounter.

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:24.590 align:middle line:90%
And-- And one of the things--

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That is amazing.

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:26.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Oh yeah.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.393 align:middle line:84%
They were drawing
the same things,

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:28.394 align:middle line:90%
and the logs and the creature.

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:29.895 align:middle line:84%
All they were drawing
and the craft

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.597 align:middle line:84%
and the lights around
these discs.

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:33.933 align:middle line:84%
They were flying saucers,
they were all silver

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:35.234 align:middle line:90%
and they reflected light.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And what time
period would this be, James?

00:20:37.136 --> 00:20:38.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: 10:30 in
the morning, 1994.

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:40.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: 1994.

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:44.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, and John Mack went
I guess within a week or two.

00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:45.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He went out there?

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:46.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: He went out
there with a camera crew

00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:49.515 align:middle line:84%
and he documented this whole
thing and really well actually.

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:51.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So it's
an incredible case?

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:53.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: It is beyond
incredible case

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:55.421 align:middle line:84%
and it's amazing how many
people don't know about this.

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:59.625 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much more to
this case that was, you know,

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:01.093 align:middle line:84%
there was a guy named
Randall Nickerson.

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.261 align:middle line:90%
He kept mentioning his name

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:04.096 align:middle line:84%
because he's been working
on this since 2006.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.764 align:middle line:84%
He's been to Africa
a couple of time.

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:07.700 align:middle line:84%
He's been reaching out
to some other witnesses.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.669 align:middle line:84%
He's been finding out that
there were UFO sightings

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:12.004 align:middle line:90%
in the area days before.

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:13.072 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Is he a researcher?

00:21:13.072 --> 00:21:14.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Oh he's a
great researcher, yes.

00:21:14.907 --> 00:21:16.509 align:middle line:84%
And he went out and
got interviews

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:19.812 align:middle line:84%
with a BBC correspondent which
unfortunately now is dead.

00:21:19.812 --> 00:21:22.014 align:middle line:84%
And John Mack, of course,
as you we all know--

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:22.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Is dead.

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:23.983 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Is dead.

00:21:23.983 --> 00:21:26.118 align:middle line:84%
And this guy is in possession,
Randall Nickerson, we cut a deal

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.487 align:middle line:84%
where we got to license
some of his material

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:30.089 align:middle line:84%
and get access to
these witnesses.

00:21:30.089 --> 00:21:32.758 align:middle line:84%
And it was just-- it's a
life changing moment for me.

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:33.592 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That is amazing.

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:34.827 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: There must be sometimes

00:21:34.827 --> 00:21:37.263 align:middle line:84%
when you had been conducting
interviews with people

00:21:37.263 --> 00:21:38.864 align:middle line:84%
and thought well this
is an amazing time.

00:21:38.864 --> 00:21:40.099 align:middle line:90%
This is a really special.

00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And I'm right here.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Your right there
and your experiencing it.

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:45.638 align:middle line:84%
That's how I felt during the
time of the Ruwa, Zimbabwe case.

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:48.274 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel honored
to be a part of it,

00:21:48.274 --> 00:21:50.509 align:middle line:90%
honored to have the opportunity

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:52.478 align:middle line:84%
to get this information
out to larger public.

00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:53.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:21:53.546 --> 00:21:54.947 align:middle line:84%
These children who
are now adults, James,

00:21:54.947 --> 00:21:57.183 align:middle line:84%
did they show emotion when
you were talking to them.

00:21:57.183 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Oh, are you kidding me?

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:90%
It was unbelievable.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: "701," you call
your new documentary.

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:90%
Where did you get the name?

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Sorry.

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:07.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What happened?

00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:07.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: It was just
really profound.

00:22:07.927 --> 00:22:09.428 align:middle line:90%
That-- that was-- Everyone

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:11.764 align:middle line:84%
in the room you could hear a
pin drop during the testimony

00:22:11.764 --> 00:22:12.865 align:middle line:90%
of these women.

00:22:12.865 --> 00:22:15.134 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a shred
of doubt in your mind

00:22:15.134 --> 00:22:16.202 align:middle line:84%
that they were telling
the truth.

00:22:16.202 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Not a shred of doubt.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.571 align:middle line:90%
You know when you feel that?

00:22:18.571 --> 00:22:19.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yup, you could tell.

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:20.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Oh yeah.

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:21.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You know.

00:22:21.607 --> 00:22:22.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, phenomenal but--

00:22:22.942 --> 00:22:24.476 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And for someone like
you who's devoted his life

00:22:24.476 --> 00:22:25.978 align:middle line:90%
to getting this answer.

00:22:25.978 --> 00:22:27.947 align:middle line:84%
That must have been pretty
profound for you too.

00:22:27.947 --> 00:22:29.181 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: It was just--

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:31.283 align:middle line:84%
I was having to pinch myself
during the interviews.

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:34.019 align:middle line:84%
Just-- it was all hugs and
every one-- it was beautiful.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:36.822 align:middle line:84%
And they said do you know what
it's like for us to be in a room

00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:38.757 align:middle line:84%
of people that are
not ridiculing us.

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:39.825 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
be on the defense.

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:41.193 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
defend what we saw.

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.428 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:22:42.428 --> 00:22:43.929 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: That is and you know
a really wonderful thing

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:45.664 align:middle line:84%
for people that have
experienced these type.

00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:47.333 align:middle line:84%
Could you imagine trying
to tell your parents

00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:49.568 align:middle line:84%
or your best friends or your
husband and have them looking

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:51.937 align:middle line:84%
at you like, you know,
your smoking Wacky Tabacky?

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:52.571 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:53.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: You know.

00:22:53.806 --> 00:22:55.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, what was
it like for you being there

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:58.777 align:middle line:84%
as this documentary
film maker picking

00:22:58.777 --> 00:23:02.314 align:middle line:84%
up on this incredible
story when all your life,

00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:05.718 align:middle line:84%
all you have been trying to
do is get answers to this.

00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:08.721 align:middle line:84%
This must have sent chills up
your arms like you were saying.

00:23:08.721 --> 00:23:10.422 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: I'm reliving it a
little bit as I'm talking to you

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:11.690 align:middle line:84%
about it and I'm
getting kind of teared

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.092 align:middle line:84%
up about it 'cause it
was tough because--

00:23:13.092 --> 00:23:13.759 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You are.

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:15.127 align:middle line:90%
You seem emotional.

00:23:15.127 --> 00:23:16.996 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: It was the most-- it
was a defining moment in my--

00:23:16.996 --> 00:23:19.531 align:middle line:84%
in my research career
and a defining moment

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:84%
in my documentary
film making career.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.169 align:middle line:84%
And I can assure you that
"701" is going to blow people

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:26.772 align:middle line:84%
out of the water because
we're getting new--

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:28.607 align:middle line:84%
we're picking really
solid cases,

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:29.675 align:middle line:90%
cases that people have heard

00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:31.944 align:middle line:84%
of like the 1964
Socorro, New Mexico case.

00:23:31.944 --> 00:23:32.811 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: We got to
get into that too.

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:33.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: That's a
close encounter.

00:23:33.846 --> 00:23:34.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's an
incredible story.

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:35.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Close encounter
of the third kind.

00:23:35.948 --> 00:23:37.283 align:middle line:84%
I've always thought
of this next film

00:23:37.283 --> 00:23:40.753 align:middle line:84%
as the real life close
encounters but cases

00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:45.724 align:middle line:84%
that we are uncovering
new material, new facts,

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:48.761 align:middle line:84%
new evidence and cases
that could just blow people

00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:51.764 align:middle line:84%
out of the water I mean honestly
and the production values

00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:52.765 align:middle line:90%
and the people writing.

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:53.899 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aliens script
writer editor--

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:55.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Everything
you touch is A plus.

00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: We have-- We have the
best opportunity right now.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.006 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- I feel honored
to be a part of this.

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:02.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Tell about
the name, "701."

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:03.809 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:06.578 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Well we were-- we were
looking for a title that--

00:24:06.578 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:84%
we don't like something
that hits you over head

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.948 align:middle line:90%
with flying saucer or UFO.

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: I've always felt like
just to be a little bit discreet

00:24:12.251 --> 00:24:13.452 align:middle line:90%
about the whole thing.

00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:15.688 align:middle line:84%
And so we were sitting
around the table and some

00:24:15.688 --> 00:24:19.825 align:middle line:84%
of our co-producers were
bouncing some ideas around.

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:23.762 align:middle line:84%
And one of the producers,
Ines, actually said what a 700?

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:26.231 align:middle line:90%
And we thought oh you mean 700.

00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:27.299 align:middle line:90%
She said yeah, the numbers

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.834 align:middle line:84%
that the Air Force
was unable to explain.

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:30.769 align:middle line:84%
Then we found out
later that it was "701"

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:31.937 align:middle line:84%
which we thought
was even better.

00:24:31.937 --> 00:24:33.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:24:33.272 --> 00:24:35.441 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: So it's not-- and
then people said oh well your

00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:84%
documentary film on the
cases in Project Blue Book

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.213 align:middle line:84%
that remained unexplained and we
said yeah, I recovered a couple

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:44.149 align:middle line:84%
of those and we'll do a little
hit of historical perspective.

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:47.720 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly it's
what that number symbolizes.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.822 align:middle line:84%
And that numbers
symbolizes, the cases,

00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:51.357 align:middle line:90%
stubborn unambiguous cases

00:24:51.357 --> 00:24:53.892 align:middle line:84%
that the Air Force was
not able to explain.

00:24:53.892 --> 00:24:57.563 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they
weren't setting up in 1947

00:24:57.563 --> 00:25:01.433 align:middle line:84%
or when it terminated
in '69 to say all UFOs,

00:25:01.433 --> 00:25:02.601 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
space spacecraft.

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:04.169 align:middle line:84%
The question is are
any of them--

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:06.472 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are any-- But
something was happening

00:25:06.472 --> 00:25:08.507 align:middle line:90%
and they just didn't understand.

00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:11.243 align:middle line:84%
The Zamora case in
Socorro, New Mexico.

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:12.177 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Yeah.

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:13.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He was
a police officer.

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:14.646 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what he saw.

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:15.714 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, Socorro,
New Mexico.

00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:19.084 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. This is a phenomenal case.

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:84%
This case was a turning
point for Dr. Hynek.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I-- I found this
out what we know in this

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.426 align:middle line:84%
but I really found this
out actually by going

00:25:27.426 --> 00:25:30.229 align:middle line:84%
to the National Archives with
a gentlemen named Ray Stanford

00:25:30.229 --> 00:25:33.565 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a book called "Socorro
Saucer and the Pentagon Pantry".

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:34.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: This is
such a great case.

00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:38.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: This case is phenomenal
and Tracy Torme is the one

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:39.938 align:middle line:84%
that kept pushing
this case on me.

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:41.306 align:middle line:84%
And I'd heard a little
bit about it of course.

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:42.608 align:middle line:90%
I knew a little bit about it.

00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:44.777 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't realize to the
extent of what really went

00:25:44.777 --> 00:25:47.413 align:middle line:84%
down with that case until I've
been doing some more research

00:25:47.413 --> 00:25:50.015 align:middle line:84%
and reading and I have met
with some of the people

00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:51.383 align:middle line:90%
that written books on it.

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:54.987 align:middle line:84%
And what makes this case
so spectacular in my view

00:25:54.987 --> 00:25:56.388 align:middle line:84%
and probably in the
view of those

00:25:56.388 --> 00:26:01.293 align:middle line:84%
in the Air Force was the fact
that there was physical evidence

00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:04.329 align:middle line:84%
to collaborate a
testimony of police officer.

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:06.532 align:middle line:84%
And the police officers
credentials were by--

00:26:06.532 --> 00:26:07.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Impeccable.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Impeccable.

00:26:08.634 --> 00:26:10.903 align:middle line:84%
Everyone who knew him said this
guy is not one to make it up.

00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:12.738 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact he
wanted to play it down.

00:26:12.738 --> 00:26:15.073 align:middle line:84%
He didn't go on and try
to capitalize on this.

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact he
barely even told his kids

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:18.644 align:middle line:90%
about it you know.

00:26:18.644 --> 00:26:19.812 align:middle line:90%
And as a mater a fact when his--

00:26:19.812 --> 00:26:21.180 align:middle line:84%
when his kids were
making inquiries

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.415 align:middle line:84%
to him he said you want
to know about the case,

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:25.617 align:middle line:90%
talk to this man Ray Stanford.

00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:26.718 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He didn't
want to talk about it.

00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:28.554 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Well talk about
this read this book.

00:26:28.554 --> 00:26:31.457 align:middle line:84%
And-- and there was--
this is one thing

00:26:31.457 --> 00:26:34.560 align:middle line:84%
that were uncovering the Air
Force was adamant 'cause this

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.028 align:middle line:84%
got out before the Air
Force was trying to--

00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Yeah, and this was
he saw an egg shaped craft.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: OK, yeah,
I'll talk about that.

00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:40.766 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: With little occupants.

00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:43.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: So he's in hot pursuit.

00:26:43.135 --> 00:26:45.571 align:middle line:90%
It's late in the afternoon.

00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:48.607 align:middle line:90%
It's April 24th, 1964.

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:50.943 align:middle line:84%
This is a small town
of Socorro, New Mexico.

00:26:50.943 --> 00:26:53.812 align:middle line:84%
And this police officer Lonnie
Zamora is pursuing a speeder

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:55.547 align:middle line:90%
going through town in a Chevy.

00:26:55.547 --> 00:26:57.049 align:middle line:90%
I think it was a black Chevy.

00:26:57.049 --> 00:27:00.719 align:middle line:84%
And it the midst of the pursuit,
he sees a flash of light

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:02.154 align:middle line:84%
which he thinks is
maybe perhaps coming

00:27:02.154 --> 00:27:03.789 align:middle line:84%
from a dynamite shack
or something.

00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:05.123 align:middle line:90%
He's not sure.

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:08.894 align:middle line:84%
But he terminates the hot
pursuit to go and investigate.

00:27:08.894 --> 00:27:10.829 align:middle line:84%
He drives off road in a
dirt road and he's driving

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:14.099 align:middle line:84%
up this hill and he sees what
he thinks is an overturning car,

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:16.835 align:middle line:84%
excuse me, with a two
children standing next to it.

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:18.237 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Aha!

00:27:18.237 --> 00:27:19.705 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: So he's thinking of my
gosh, there's been an auto wreck

00:27:19.705 --> 00:27:23.442 align:middle line:84%
and I need to go help these
people out, these children out.

00:27:23.442 --> 00:27:27.212 align:middle line:84%
As he gets closer and closer
to this craft, this thing he's

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:31.116 align:middle line:84%
like that's not a car and
those aren't children.

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:33.385 align:middle line:84%
And he's driving his car
over and his looking--

00:27:33.385 --> 00:27:34.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Gosh, now
you're chilling me.

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:36.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Yeah, and he's
looking over to the left and--

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:38.757 align:middle line:84%
and he's looking off to
his left as his driving

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:40.559 align:middle line:90%
up this hill down at this thing.

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:45.264 align:middle line:84%
And there are two beings and one
of them sees him and locks eyes

00:27:45.264 --> 00:27:47.032 align:middle line:90%
with him and it's startled.

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:49.001 align:middle line:84%
He said that they were doing
something with the craft

00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:51.236 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of the
craft and become startled

00:27:51.236 --> 00:27:53.672 align:middle line:84%
and then they scurry
around the back side.

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:56.208 align:middle line:84%
And he continues driving
to get a closer look.

00:27:56.208 --> 00:27:58.744 align:middle line:84%
And when he got within I
think it's about hundred feet

00:27:58.744 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:84%
of the craft when he parked his
car, the beings were no longer

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.248 align:middle line:90%
but the craft was still there.

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:05.651 align:middle line:84%
He gets out of his car he starts
making a B line towards the

00:28:05.651 --> 00:28:07.386 align:middle line:84%
craft and that's
when it fired up.

00:28:07.386 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And it was gone?

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: It wasn't gone
immediately but it fired up

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:12.624 align:middle line:90%
and it made a very loud roar.

00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And there was a-- some
sort of propulsion panel

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.029 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom that's kind of
like rocket but not rocket

00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:18.964 align:middle line:84%
because the propulsion
when it hit the ground

00:28:18.964 --> 00:28:21.333 align:middle line:84%
like a rocket you expect dust
and stuff to fly everywhere.

00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:22.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Everywhere
and a little crater.

00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:23.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: None of that,
none of that.

00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:24.403 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't any of that.

00:28:24.403 --> 00:28:27.239 align:middle line:84%
This-- this beam of blue light
went down through the ground

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:29.841 align:middle line:84%
and penetrated the ground but
it didn't stir anything up.

00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:30.909 align:middle line:90%
But it made a loud sound.

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:33.445 align:middle line:84%
And in when it got
to about 20 feet,

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:35.547 align:middle line:84%
the thing went silent,
completely silent.

00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:36.882 align:middle line:90%
No more blue flame, nothing.

00:28:36.882 --> 00:28:39.151 align:middle line:84%
Like it switched to a
slightly different propulsion.

00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:42.087 align:middle line:84%
And then it slowly drifted
off and then it went

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:44.456 align:middle line:84%
up about a 45 degree angle
and then disappeared.

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:46.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Can you imagine
what he was thinking?

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:47.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Fox: Oh-- oh yeah.

00:28:47.693 --> 00:28:48.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I mean unbelievable.

00:28:48.694 --> 00:28:50.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: So this is
a police officer.

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:53.432 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, so his fellow
officers arrive on the scene

00:28:53.432 --> 00:28:54.366 align:middle line:90%
about a minute and half.

00:28:54.366 --> 00:28:55.434 align:middle line:90%
We are about to go--

00:28:55.434 --> 00:28:56.235 align:middle line:84%
we are about to go
meet with one of the--

00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:57.369 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: The craft is gone.

00:28:57.369 --> 00:28:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: The craft is
unfortunately gone.

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.172 align:middle line:84%
His fellow officers
arrive on the scene.

00:29:00.172 --> 00:29:02.007 align:middle line:90%
The bushes are still smoldering.

00:29:02.007 --> 00:29:04.676 align:middle line:84%
There's sand that's
been vitrified,

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:06.178 align:middle line:90%
turned to glass, right?

00:29:06.178 --> 00:29:08.246 align:middle line:84%
And there are four
imprints on the ground

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:09.348 align:middle line:90%
of something very heavy.

00:29:09.348 --> 00:29:10.682 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Something was there.

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:12.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Something heavy enough
to make very deep imprints

00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:84%
in the sand 'cause there was
this all of this evidence.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.288 align:middle line:90%
There was burnt debris.

00:29:16.288 --> 00:29:18.223 align:middle line:90%
There's bushes on fire.

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:20.058 align:middle line:90%
There's vitrified sand.

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:84%
There's all this stuff
and one of the guy,

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.996 align:middle line:84%
Officer Jordan takes his
camera out and he shoots all

00:29:23.996 --> 00:29:25.964 align:middle line:84%
of these pictures and
documents all of it.

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:29.134 align:middle line:84%
An hour and half later Richard
T. Holder, a military guy,

00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:32.337 align:middle line:84%
army colonel comes
from White Sands.

00:29:32.337 --> 00:29:33.639 align:middle line:90%
He gets there with a couple

00:29:33.639 --> 00:29:35.841 align:middle line:84%
of other people takes
Jordan's photographs

00:29:35.841 --> 00:29:38.477 align:middle line:84%
and says we'll develop them
and we'll get those back to you

00:29:38.477 --> 00:29:40.178 align:middle line:84%
and then takes over
the whole thing.

00:29:40.178 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And the
pictures never came back?

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.714 align:middle line:84%
>> Fox: Pictures
never came back.

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:44.483 align:middle line:84%
And we have an affidavit
statement from Jordan,

00:29:44.483 --> 00:29:45.851 align:middle line:90%
Officer Jordan about that.

00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:48.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: All right James, we're
going to continue on another

00:29:48.387 --> 00:29:50.689 align:middle line:84%
"Beyond Belief" show with
you about these stories.

00:29:50.689 --> 00:29:52.324 align:middle line:90%
They're truly remarkable.

00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:55.127 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to see
the documentary, "701."

00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:58.897 align:middle line:84%
We're with James Fox documentary
film producer and thank you

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:90%
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.301 align:middle line:90%
