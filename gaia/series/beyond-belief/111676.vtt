00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:07.655 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:07.655 --> 00:00:08.863 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:10.634 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.600 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.369 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.118 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:10%
And tonight on the
program, a topic

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:10%
that is very dear to my
heart, remote viewing.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I've dabbled in it a little bit.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And our special guest
is Lyn Buchanan,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:84%
who once worked
with the US military

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:90%
in its remote viewing program.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Lynn, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LYN BUCHANAN: Well,
thank you for inviting me.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a great honor to be here.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is exciting.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.138 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little
bit more about you

00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and how you got
involved in this.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:10%
>>BUCHANAN: Parts of how
I got involved are still

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:10%
classified or close hold.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:10%
But there was an incident--

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I can't
beat it out of you?

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.218 align:middle line:10%
>>BUCHANAN: No, probably not.

00:00:59.218 --> 00:01:00.167 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:10%
>>BUCHANAN: There
was an incident over

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:10%
in Augsburg, Germany,
where I was stationed.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.480 align:middle line:10%
And I was responsible
for, they say,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:10%
the destruction of about $50
million worth of computers.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:90%
I got flaming angry.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I get flaming angry
like that, bad things happen.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So I generally try to
stay a happy person.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, General
Stubblebine, the commander

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:84%
of the intelligence
forces, wanted

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to start a unit where we
would destroy enemy computers

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:90%
mentally.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mentally.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And then
with the final goal

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.647 align:middle line:84%
of controlling the
enemy computers

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
rather than destroying
them so that we could

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
make their missiles go back
at them or into the sea

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:90%
And so he came out.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:90%
He took me back to DC.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And he had, of course, to
get funding for the unit

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and get permission to have
such a unit and all that.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:90%
And Congress said no.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.750 align:middle line:84%
It smacked too much
of mind control,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and they'd been caught
for that back in the '60s.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:90%
And so anyway, there I was.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:90%
No assignment.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:90%
General Stubblebine said, OK.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take you out to
this unit out at Fort Meade

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:90%
and put you in there.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
remote viewing unit.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:90%
And so they read me on.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Reading on is a process where
they tell you what you do,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and you sign a paper saying,
I'm going to jail if I ever

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:90%
tell anybody this and all that.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:90%
And they read me on.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
is the military.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:90%
The military doesn't do this.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But sure enough, I watched
them work, and they were doing.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was great.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And had you been
doing this all your life?

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Just didn't even know what
it was really called, maybe?

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: You know what
a poltergeist kid is?

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Exactly what
is a poltergeist kid?

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: There's recorded
phenomena, videotaped even,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:84%
about kids who, if
they're mentally upset

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
or-- the ones with
mental, emotional problems

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:84%
get all the bad rap-- things
fly off of shelves and lights

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.100 align:middle line:84%
go on and off and things
tip over and fall over.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're gifted.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: It's a gift
if you know how to use it.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:90%
If not, it's a curse.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:90%
And it happened to me.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:90%
And I learned how to use it.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:84%
But the ones you see on the
movies and all that, of course,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:84%
this kid-- their head spins
around and all this stuff.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's just called
psychokinesis.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.200 align:middle line:90%
And some kids have it naturally.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And even about 12 years old,
those things started happening.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was interested in
them and started trying

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to control them.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I found out was

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:84%
that if you're one of these
people, you don't get mad.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Bad things happen.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I had controlled
it all through my life.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to the
remote viewing unit,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Skip Atwater, who was
the operations manager,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.350 align:middle line:84%
took me over to the building
where everybody worked.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.915 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look around
here at the baseboard

00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and look at the
ceiling and all that.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want you
to know, in this room,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:90%
it's OK to be psychic.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
lifetime of weight

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.725 align:middle line:90%
was lifted off my shoulder.

00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.042 align:middle line:84%
Somebody actually accepted
you for who you were.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was like throwing
a duck into water.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I loved it.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I loved the rest of my time in
service working for that unit.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:90%
It was fantastic.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a
poltergeist kid, I mean,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
this is something that you
were born with, no doubt.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.720 align:middle line:90%
Something followed you?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I guess.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.361 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I don't know.

00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:14.915 align:middle line:84%
Around 12 years old,
things started happening.

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:17.600 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
One day, I was out just throwing
rocks at this big tin sheet.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And I heard this little
voice say, go through.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And the rock actually
went through the tin sheet

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:90%
and hit the wall behind it.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of us kids
went over and looked.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.315 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, that is neat.

00:05:37.315 --> 00:05:38.652 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How'd this happen?

00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:90%
That's neat as crap, man.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.364 align:middle line:84%
And so I started playing with
it and started developing it.

00:05:46.364 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Getting better
and better and better.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And one
day, I got flaming mad.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Some bad stuff happened.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to impress this
cute little red-headed girl.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
My life parallels Charlie
Brown's in a lot of ways.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And so she was very
impressed and went home

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and told her father, the
Pentecostal minister.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the next day,
he and three of his deacons

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
met me on the way
home from school.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old were you?

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.555 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I was about 12.

00:06:16.555 --> 00:06:17.514 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere around there.

00:06:17.514 --> 00:06:18.638 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a little kid.

00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my daughter
told me about this.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:90%
Can you show me?

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:90%
I can show you.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And by that, time I'd
learned to control it.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the minute I
showed him, I mean,

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.330 align:middle line:84%
they had me down on the
sidewalk and pressing my head

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.770 align:middle line:84%
into the sidewalk and
screaming for the devil

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:90%
to come out of me.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
trying to exorcise you

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:90%
right there, right?

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Right there on the sidewalk.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:90%
And at 12 years old--

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're screaming
and legs are flailing.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.325 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: No.

00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:90%
I wet my pants.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was raised in
the Baptist Church.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And if the preacher says it,
then, obviously, God said it.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first time
ever that I started thinking,

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:90%
I wonder if this is bad.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, I
tried to control it

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:90%
until that incident in Augsburg.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.370 align:middle line:90%
I got flaming mad.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:90%
Computers blew out.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems like
the temper has something

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.629 align:middle line:90%
to do with destruction.

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: In my case it does.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.596 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:24.596 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stay calm hear, Lyn.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Stay calm.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I try
to never get mad.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:33.030 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, General Stubblebine
had some people out,

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.750 align:middle line:84%
had some officers out who were
looking for psychic ability

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:84%
because he had the remote
viewing project and all that.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted a PK project
to destroy computers.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of those officers
happen to be at this meeting

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.720 align:middle line:90%
and reported me.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And General
Stubblebine came out.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:90%
I was standing at attention.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:90%
And he got right up in my face.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, did you kill
my computers with your mind?

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:90%
And this scowl on his face.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And I could just see my
great grandchildren still

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:90%
paying for computers.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.552 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You wiped them all out?

00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And for a still
classified amount of time,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
we had no intelligence
collection

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.196 align:middle line:84%
on the entire Russian
and East German border.

00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because all
the computers were down.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: They were gone.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:84%
We would take books
to read to work.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.120 align:middle line:84%
They had spy-in-the-sky
satellites.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:84%
We had to make it look
like business as usual.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were
you mad about?

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I had
written a program

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:84%
to tie the computers of
12 different countries

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:84%
together to share
intelligence information.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was giving-- I
had the program done.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I was giving the talk to
introduce this program.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And we had the room
full of the top brass

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.650 align:middle line:90%
of 12 different countries.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.640 align:middle line:84%
This other sergeant
had wanted the job

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.970 align:middle line:90%
of doing the programming.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And I did my little song and
dance, hit the Enter button,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.020 align:middle line:90%
and the screen went blank.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:90%
And I turned around.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And this other sergeant
was at the back door.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And he mouthed, gotcha
and turned around.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, he set you up.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I flamed out.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So everything else
went too at the same time.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN:
Everything else went.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.628 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it instant
when that happens?

00:09:35.628 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, a lot
of that is still

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:84%
classified-- the length of time
it was out and everything else.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, these
representatives were there.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Are their mouths open?

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:90%
What's happening there?

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: When that
screen went blank,

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:90%
they were chuckling.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And when everything
went blank, some of them

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:90%
were laughing out loud.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, oh, look at
the American programmer.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.510 align:middle line:90%
He failed and all that.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And when General
Stubblebine came out

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and had me standing at
attention and asked me that,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I
could lie about it.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I
decided to lie about it.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And I heard myself
say, yes sir, I did.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:90%
This grin came across his face.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:90%
And he said, far f-ing out.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.994 align:middle line:90%
Have I ever got a job for you.

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wanted
this to happen.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:30.285 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:10:30.285 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he
took me back to DC.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
an amazing thing.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk to Lyn about
the military applications

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
of remote viewing, which you
call controlled remote viewing.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:84%
What is controlled as opposed
to just remote viewing?

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, when the press
came out with the military

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
uses psychic spies,
everybody thought

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:84%
the military used
psychics for spying.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Not true.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.901 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not true at all.

00:10:57.901 --> 00:10:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Not true at all.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:84%
They had developed a
method that's more actually

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:90%
like a martial art.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And they had developed
it at Stanford Research.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way that
anyone can sit down and go

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.580 align:middle line:84%
through this pre-programmed
step-by-step method.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And you get information
from your subconscious mind.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.424 align:middle line:84%
Well, the subconscious is
psychic with varying ability.

00:11:25.424 --> 00:11:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:90%
And we all have it.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: We all
have it to some degree.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And so this process is only an
interview-and-report process

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.270 align:middle line:84%
using the body as a
translator between

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:90%
the conscious and subconscious.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And you interview
your subconscious,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.560 align:middle line:90%
and you report what it says.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So the controlled remote
viewing is a process.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not psychic.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:90%
It's an interview-and-report.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a science.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:57.895 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It's a science.

00:11:57.895 --> 00:11:58.680 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as the information
came out that the military had

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:07.670 align:middle line:84%
been using this and that it
was scientifically approved,

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, we had
crystal-ball remote viewers

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.945 align:middle line:84%
and tea-leaf remote viewers
and palm remote viewers--

00:12:14.945 --> 00:12:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Coming out of
the woodwork, right?

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.713 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, man.

00:12:16.713 --> 00:12:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, remote viewing these
days is the new-age word

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:90%
for psychic.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And this
is why we distinguish

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
controlled remote
viewing, which is

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.780 align:middle line:84%
the science that was
developed for the military

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:90%
from remote viewing.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
That distinction gets
lost all the time.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's still there.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.940 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm about as psychic as a rock.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
But you task me, and I sit
down and do the remote viewing

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.844 align:middle line:90%
process, and--

00:12:50.844 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
very good at that.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And I can draw you
the floor plans of the building

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:90%
where the hostage is being held.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how accurate?

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Pretty darn close?

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: We did a
two-month test one time.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And we found perception
by perception,

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:84%
against hard feedback, that we
had an accuracy rate of right

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.535 align:middle line:90%
around 72.8%.

00:13:12.535 --> 00:13:14.009 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: For the
intelligence community it is.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
highest accuracy rates.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Better even, than spy-in-the-sky
satellites because we can see

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:90%
inside the building.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.546 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:13:23.546 --> 00:13:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: They can't.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So we had that
accuracy rate overall.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
We found out that
different viewers

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.760 align:middle line:90%
are better at different things.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:84%
One person's good at
colors, one person's

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.560 align:middle line:84%
good at sizes and
shapes, and so on.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And so we found
that if we dissect

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:84%
our tasking to the
different abilities

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:84%
of the different
viewers, one viewer

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:90%
maybe 99% accurate in colors.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Another one's-- that by
sorting it out that way,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:84%
we could come up with an
accuracy in the 90 percentile

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.184 align:middle line:90%
range.

00:14:02.184 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And so it
was working very well.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.560 align:middle line:90%
We were doing fantastic work.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why disband it?

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: The saying is
that in Washington, DC,

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
there are two answers that
answer every question--

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:90%
money and politics.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And the end of
the Cold War came.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:29.005 align:middle line:84%
And the politics of using
those crazy psychics

00:14:29.005 --> 00:14:34.070 align:middle line:84%
out there at Fort Meade,
and also budgeting

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle line:90%
was cutting all over the place.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And so do you get
rid of a ground agent

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:90%
with 19 years of experience?

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Or do you get rid of that
unit out there at Fort Meade.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You get rid of
the unit, unfortunately.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: You get
rid of the unit.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is,
for the funding,

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:84%
every unit has a
budget for personnel

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:90%
and a budget for equipment.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.304 align:middle line:84%
In our unit, the personnel
was the equipment.

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: They got
us at half price.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And we were also in
condemned buildings.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And we got our furniture
and our equipment

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.820 align:middle line:90%
from property disposal.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.150 align:middle line:84%
We weren't costing
them anything.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
did the unit last?

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: The unit lasted,
under different designations,

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:90%
for a little bit over 18 years.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, before that,
it was developing.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:37.989 align:middle line:84%
And so it had, really, about
a 22- to 23-year period.

00:15:37.989 --> 00:15:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And did you stay in
it for the entire--

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I was
in it for 8 and 1/2

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.980 align:middle line:84%
years, almost the last 8 and
1/2 years that it was there.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
ever out, though?

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.502 align:middle line:84%
Once you're in, aren't you
in forever, technically?

00:15:53.502 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I'm--

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know something.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.195 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:15:58.195 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like the CIA.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: They
effectively declassified it.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And the key word
here is effective.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to do
anything if we talk about it.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But if they decide that they
don't want it declassified,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
then all of a sudden we're
guilty and can be prosecuted.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I still keep up
with what's classified

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:90%
and what's not.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a point
person at the military still?

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:90%
I maybe pushing you here.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: There's
an office, yeah.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
still an office.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.516 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This really
hasn't been closed.

00:16:35.516 --> 00:16:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Effectively
it has been closed.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people ask me, do they
still have a unit doing that?

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And once you retire, they
quit telling you secrets.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the answer
is I don't know.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
But I really hope they do
because we were so effective.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:90%
We were doing a lot of good.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And they would be
stupid and irresponsible

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.788 align:middle line:84%
not to have a unit
like that now.

00:17:09.788 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the good people
who aren't there full-time

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.250 align:middle line:84%
anymore-- you, Russell
Targ, Paul Smith--

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: We get called.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.614 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do get called.

00:17:17.614 --> 00:17:19.599 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: We get called.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, they
would be stupid not

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
to have a unit like
that and irresponsible.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:84%
That changes the question to
whether our government ever

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.082 align:middle line:84%
does anything stupid
and irresponsible.

00:17:32.082 --> 00:17:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we
know that answer.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm afraid of.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you folks
involved in the hunt

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:90%
for Osama bin Laden?

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you think
you were successful?

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Or at least gave them the
information they needed?

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Long before that.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know when the
Navy attacked and all that.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- I
was out of service.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if anyone
was doing that or not.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.807 align:middle line:84%
I was not personally
involved in that one.

00:17:58.807 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Play a little
experiment here, Lyn.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:84%
My executive producer,
Tom Danheiser,

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:84%
wanted to check out
controlled remote viewing.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.955 align:middle line:90%
And he wrote something here.

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if
I should lead you,

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:84%
to hint what it might
be or a category.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It doesn't matter.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.099 align:middle line:90%
I already know the answer.

00:18:18.099 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know
the answer to this?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.348 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:18:20.348 --> 00:18:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Let me do this as a
graphic demonstration

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:90%
because-- I have no idea.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a psychic.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm a controlled
remote viewer who

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.050 align:middle line:84%
is trained in a method
that takes about an hour.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.530 align:middle line:84%
You give me an
hour, I can tell you

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:84%
exactly what's written on here,
and I could probably reproduce

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.480 align:middle line:90%
it in his handwriting.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.250 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not a psychic.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.781 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Psychic is not
controlled remote viewing.

00:18:49.781 --> 00:18:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big difference.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And I'm glad
this happened because that

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:90%
lets me demonstrate.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.916 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what's
in that envelope.

00:19:01.916 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:84%
I could sit down and do a
controlled remote viewing

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.267 align:middle line:84%
session and tell you
in an hour or so.

00:19:07.267 --> 00:19:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Do you have an hour?

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, sir.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.245 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: OK.

00:19:09.245 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How easy is
it to teach someone

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:90%
how to be a remote viewer?

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: It's
actually very easy.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
The process is
organized in such a way

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that it was developed
for the dumbest grunt

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:90%
soldier on the battlefield.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:84%
The original idea was
that we would get soldiers

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.687 align:middle line:84%
off the battlefield, teach them
how to do this, send them back,

00:19:37.687 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and they could tell their
commander what's over the hill

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and where to point
the guns and all that.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And come to find out, it
takes so much training--

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.750 align:middle line:90%
not training.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
It takes so much practice
that they finally just

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:84%
decided, OK, we're going to
have a remote-viewing unit.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Other units can
send us questions.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle line:90%
We'll send them the answer back.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And that way, they only had
to train six or seven people

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lyn what is it
about remote viewing that

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:84%
allows you to literally see
without your physical eyes?

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: One of the
things is that a psychic will

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:90%
try to tell you what it is.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:84%
With a controlled
remote viewer, your body

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.345 align:middle line:84%
acts as the translator
between your subconscious

00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:24.770 align:middle line:90%
and conscious.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And so you actually
do see with your eyes.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:90%
And you smell with your nose.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.617 align:middle line:90%
And you feel things.

00:20:30.617 --> 00:20:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though
you're not there.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Even though
you're not there.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:84%
But this process takes
you from psychic as a rock

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:84%
all the way to where
you're feeling,

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:47.010 align:middle line:84%
you're letting your subconscious
put electrical signals

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:84%
into your eyes and your nose
and all that, the nerve signals.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And you describe-- at the end
of a remote viewing session,

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:84%
the remote viewer still has
no idea what the target is.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.890 align:middle line:84%
But he has described
it perfectly.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
can't even lead them.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: You can't
even lead them, no.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all?

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:08.995 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: No.

00:21:08.995 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you do lead them,
it just messes up the process.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I had heart that.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of
capturing what it is,

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:84%
you're really not supposed
to think too much, right?

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.090 align:middle line:84%
You're just supposed
to just let it happen?

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: No, no.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.410 align:middle line:84%
What you do is we
have a way to send

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:84%
a queue to our subconscious
mind through the body.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And the subconscious will send
back textures and feelings

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.400 align:middle line:90%
and smells and all that.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And you pay attention
to your body.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:90%
And, I smell roses.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:90%
"Roselike smell."

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.390 align:middle line:90%
I feel something rough.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:90%
"I feel it rough."

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:90%
And oh, this thing feels square.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.630 align:middle line:90%
It looks very big, and so on.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's this color.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.660 align:middle line:90%
It's that color.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And it makes this
sound or that sound.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And you simply report what
your body is telling you.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.672 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole secret
to remote viewing.

00:22:14.672 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be psychic.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.120 align:middle line:84%
You just pay attention
to your body.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
amazed at how it works?

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, listen,
I'm not surprised

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
by some of the things you can
do with remote viewing anymore.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:90%
I've been at it too long.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:33.868 align:middle line:84%
But if I ever quit
being amazed at it--

00:22:33.868 --> 00:22:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's over.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It's over, yeah.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.975 align:middle line:84%
I will never quit
being amazed at it.

00:22:37.975 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:48.420 align:middle line:84%
You can sit here with a pen and
piece of paper and save lives,

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.010 align:middle line:90%
bring home missing kids.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.181 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It really is.

00:22:52.181 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is dramatic.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I had a beef with a
psychic a long time ago.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:90%
She's no longer with us.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:90%
She's in the other side.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And she would go on
a television show

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and talk to the families
of missing kids.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And they would ask her, with
their grief, where's my son?

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Where's my daughter?

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And she would just very directly
say, honey, that person's dead.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
Lyn, five years later,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:84%
10 years later, the kid
would be found alive.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Is that irresponsible?

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.526 align:middle line:90%
What's--

00:23:29.526 --> 00:23:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I think
it's irresponsible.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.830 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that
the person who does it

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:84%
tends to believe that
they're doing it right.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's crooked.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not doing
it to be mean.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:45.385 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Not doing it to
be mean or especially-- well,

00:23:45.385 --> 00:23:47.055 align:middle line:84%
there are some who
do it to make money.

00:23:47.055 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: But I believe
that people fool themselves

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.330 align:middle line:90%
into thinking they're psychic.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I have met
some psychics since I've been

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:90%
in this that are really good.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they say something,
you can take it to the bank.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's real.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's maybe 4%
or 5% of the people

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I've met who say
they're psychic.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:84%
The rest, I get the feeling
that they're fooling themselves,

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:28.350 align:middle line:84%
not being dishonest but
actually believe that whatever

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.809 align:middle line:90%
comes to mind is psychic.

00:24:30.809 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I've met
those people-- you know,

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:84%
there's a spider
crawling up the wall.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that means that we
have to have world peace.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.698 align:middle line:84%
It's a spider
crawling up the wall.

00:24:41.698 --> 00:24:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With remote
viewing, I always thought--

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and maybe inaccurately--
that remote viewing was just

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:90%
present-tense events.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I've since been told that they
can also look at future events

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:90%
before they've even happened.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a little
baffled by that.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.836 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.836 --> 00:25:05.336 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: In a way, it's sort
of like weather forecasting.

00:25:05.336 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:84%
If I look at a future event for
you, maybe, and remote view it,

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and I don't tell you
about it, then it's

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:90%
probably going to happen.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.889 align:middle line:84%
But if I tell you about it,
you're going to change it.

00:25:21.889 --> 00:25:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I may change it.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:23.638 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:25:23.638 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it's called the
paradoxical tasking.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Like if I look at myself
tomorrow afternoon

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:41.036 align:middle line:84%
and I find I'm in a car wreck
so I'm in the morgue, dead,

00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:43.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting in the car.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:47.639 align:middle line:84%
I'm staying home tomorrow,
which makes my viewing wrong.

00:25:47.639 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then a car
crashes through the living room

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:50.513 align:middle line:90%
and kills you.

00:25:50.513 --> 00:25:51.985 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah, and kills me.

00:25:51.985 --> 00:25:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It happens
that way sometimes.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:54.485 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:25:54.485 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you escape fate?

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I think so.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I think, very largely,
you make your own fate.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
we seem to have found--

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and we're still
trying to prove it--

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:84%
is that if you
make a decision, it

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.430 align:middle line:84%
may change your direction in
life off in this direction

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But there are rocks
in the pond of time.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going
to move that rock.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And so even though your life
goes off in this direction,

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
it's going to wind up
coming back to that rock.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are some things
in life you can change.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Some things you can't change.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
old saying, life

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:90%
is like playing chess with God.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.199 align:middle line:84%
You can pull some really
smart moves and all that.

00:26:47.199 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:90%
But he's going to win the game.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's still
going to checkmate you.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: He's
still going to win.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.145 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
poems by Robert Frost,

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:58.300 align:middle line:84%
"The Road Not Taken"
about "two roads diverged

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:90%
in a yellow woods."

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of that is
what life is all about, too.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I do, too.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The former Soviet
Union was very heavy into this.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Who came first?

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Their program or ours?

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: This is
a little known thing.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Hitler's.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.644 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hitler?

00:27:20.644 --> 00:27:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Hitler
had a program--

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He did
dabble with this.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.965 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:27:23.965 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Hitler had a program
called Doktor Gruenbaum.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And it was not a doctor.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:31.120 align:middle line:84%
It was a program called
Doktor Gruenbaum.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And he was interested in the
Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:44.820 align:middle line:84%
He had read in the Bible that
Adam and Eve were kicked out

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.480 align:middle line:90%
of the garden.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you know why?

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've though
because they violated.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: The Bible clearly
says that he kicked them out

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:84%
of the garden lest they
also eat of the tree of life

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:90%
and live forever.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, Hitler wanted
to live forever.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So he was very interested
in the green tree, which is

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:90%
the symbol of Jewish mysticism.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And so he had Doktor
Gruenbaum, which is green tree.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were dabbling in mind
control and all of this stuff.

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:27.470 align:middle line:84%
When Hitler lost the war,
we took the nuclear people,

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.790 align:middle line:90%
the rocket people, and all that.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Russia was very
interested in this.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.680 align:middle line:84%
They took the Doktor
Gruenbaum people.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:37.786 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And
they developed it.

00:28:37.786 --> 00:28:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And in the '60s,
we were losing all

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.812 align:middle line:90%
of our classified information.

00:28:44.812 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
couldn't figure out how.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Couldn't
figure out how.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And this guy named
Penkovsky tried to defect.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And he brought with
him a whole bunch

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:59.056 align:middle line:84%
of documents from
Russian research.

00:28:59.056 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is amazing.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.520 align:middle line:90%
What a great story.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Well, when they
saw that the Russians were

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.550 align:middle line:84%
doing this, they had
a good laugh about it.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.020 align:middle line:84%
But then they said,
oh, wait a minute.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.179 align:middle line:90%
Look at this documentation.

00:29:12.179 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:90%
This is how--

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.803 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're right on.

00:29:13.803 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: This is working.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's when they
decided, well, we'd

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:23.210 align:middle line:84%
better have at least a
way to protect from it.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they were
years ahead of us.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: They were
years ahead of us,

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.340 align:middle line:90%
decades ahead of us.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:33.779 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, they found
this guy named Joe McMoneagle.

00:29:33.779 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.596 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: You know.

00:29:35.596 --> 00:29:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And they gave him one of the US
military's top-secret things.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And he was supposed
to remote view it.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was the Abrams tank.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:10%
And he not only identified
it, described it,

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:57.200 align:middle line:10%
he even drew a sketch
of the entire thing

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.040 align:middle line:10%
with everything in
place and all that.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:05.270 align:middle line:10%
And so the black cars came
out, raided the place,

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.420 align:middle line:10%
tried to take him off as a spy.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.230 align:middle line:84%
But that was the proof
that they needed.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided, you
know, if this can be done,

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.550 align:middle line:90%
maybe we need to do it, too.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.520 align:middle line:84%
But the Russians
had it first, yeah.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just an
amazing process.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.570 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah, it is.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you still use
this in your day-to-day life?

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't be without it.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To solve problems?

00:30:34.145 --> 00:30:35.395 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: To solve problems.

00:30:35.395 --> 00:30:37.322 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Curiosity?

00:30:37.322 --> 00:30:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Generally
not curiosity

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.070 align:middle line:90%
but to solve problems.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And a couple years back,
the question came up of can

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.810 align:middle line:90%
you influence the past?

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think now they
call it retrocausality.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's catching on.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And I guess about 10 years
ago, I did a four-year project

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:03.270 align:middle line:84%
in this, keeping
meticulous data,

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and found out that by doing
a remote influencing session,

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:20.780 align:middle line:84%
you can influence-- you can put
hindsight into a past decision.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.370 align:middle line:90%
And we were heavily in debt.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:26.025 align:middle line:84%
A military retirement is
just guaranteed poverty.

00:31:26.025 --> 00:31:26.770 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, absolutely.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.020 align:middle line:90%
I only got my nine years in.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.340 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't get my 20.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.720 align:middle line:90%
It's no better.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So what if you could go
through life never making

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:39.950 align:middle line:90%
a bad decision?

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned was
when it's decision time,

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:84%
sit down and do a
remote viewing session,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:84%
or I have an abbreviated
remote viewing session.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.782 align:middle line:84%
And listen to that hindsight
coming from the future.

00:31:53.782 --> 00:31:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And you'll make
the right decision.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
wondered if we could go back.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I've always called this
field the wireless internet

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.430 align:middle line:90%
that we're all connected to.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I have students
who are psychiatrists,

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:15.180 align:middle line:84%
they say the unconscious and
the collective unconscious.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:84%
As a remote viewer, as
controlled remote viewers,

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.475 align:middle line:84%
we say the subconscious because
there is no part of your mind

00:32:22.475 --> 00:32:25.332 align:middle line:90%
that is unconscious at any time.

00:32:25.332 --> 00:32:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Each part is doing its
little job all the time.

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:28.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's working away.

00:32:28.415 --> 00:32:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And we said the
collective consciousness

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:84%
because the collective
is very conscious.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:35.710 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:39.059 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me your
definition of remote viewing.

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: My definition
of remote viewing

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:84%
is that your subconscious mind
has an ability to be psychic.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, it has an ability
to gain information.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.770 align:middle line:84%
It does not have an ability
to pass that information

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.600 align:middle line:90%
to your conscious mind.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:04.795 align:middle line:84%
And so through the
martial arts, they

00:33:04.795 --> 00:33:07.716 align:middle line:84%
have found-- you know
wax on, wipe off, wax on?

00:33:07.716 --> 00:33:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Miyagi.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:09.580 align:middle line:90%
the

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:10.312 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:33:10.312 --> 00:33:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, here
comes a roundhouse swing.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:18.246 align:middle line:84%
And without thinking
consciously, you wax off.

00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
you protect yourself

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.970 align:middle line:84%
because your subconscious
knows it's coming.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:90%
It knows how to protect.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:28.170 align:middle line:90%
And so it can control your body.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we do is we
make a physical language

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:40.180 align:middle line:84%
so that if there's something
man-made at the target, for me,

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:90%
I go-- it has an angle.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.930 align:middle line:90%
It's man-made.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.680 align:middle line:84%
If there's water,
something like that.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:90%
And my pen will do that.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do is I
pass information, a cue,

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.310 align:middle line:84%
to my subconscious
through the body

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:57.660 align:middle line:90%
by writing down some numbers.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:02.730 align:middle line:84%
The numbers have no relationship
whatever to the target.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:09.030 align:middle line:84%
But it makes a record of
what session you're doing.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, right
after those numbers,

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.749 align:middle line:90%
my hand will go like that.

00:34:14.749 --> 00:34:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I don't know
what the target is.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But man, there's
some water there.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:90%
And your subconcious--

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And lo and behold,
there's water there.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And lo
and behold, there is.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And so in a martial arts method,
using a martial arts technique,

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:84%
you're interviewing
your subconscious

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:90%
and reporting what it says.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.050 align:middle line:84%
It's an interview
and report process

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.440 align:middle line:84%
that uses the body as the
translator between the two

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:90%
minds.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:44.620 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have used remote
viewing in a strange way

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.739 align:middle line:84%
sometimes when I'm
on the air with Coast

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:52.560 align:middle line:84%
to Coast, where I'll be
interviewing a guest,

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and I get into this
remote viewing mode.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And I say to them,
let me tell you

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.360 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing right now.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say, you're in a room.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Your feet are
propped up on a desk.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Your socks are white.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.634 align:middle line:90%
And they go, oh, my God.

00:35:10.634 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: How
did you know that?

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:13.299 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you know this?

00:35:13.299 --> 00:35:16.840 align:middle line:84%
The question is, Lyn,
how did I know this?

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.790 align:middle line:90%
What happened to me?

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: The question is,
if you've ever watched that old

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:90%
movie about kung fu or--

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.834 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, "Kung Fu."

00:35:25.834 --> 00:35:26.500 align:middle line:90%
David Carradine.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: The question is
why did you not know that?

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.290 align:middle line:90%
And that ability is there.

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't know it
because-- you don't normally

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:42.180 align:middle line:84%
know it because your
subconscious and conscious

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.010 align:middle line:90%
don't talk to each other.

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have learned
the remote viewing

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.110 align:middle line:84%
to the point where they
can talk to each other.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So you say to the person
who can't do this,

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.042 align:middle line:90%
how do you not know it?

00:35:56.042 --> 00:35:57.375 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the information's there.

00:35:57.375 --> 00:36:00.140 align:middle line:90%


00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And they just haven't
learned how to use it

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:06.270 align:middle line:84%
or else they have
learned not to use it.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why was I
able to pick up feet

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.650 align:middle line:84%
on the desk, white
socks as opposed

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:16.920 align:middle line:84%
to feet on the ground
and black socks?

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Because
your subconscious,

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:84%
when you're dealing
with a person like that,

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:25.750 align:middle line:84%
even over the phone
in an interview,

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious is getting
contact with that person

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and with their surroundings
and with everything else.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And any interviewer
will do that.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And any interviewer, like
a newspaper interviewer,

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:43.790 align:middle line:90%
will start talking to a person.

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:48.310 align:middle line:84%
They'll get pictures in their
mind, which they ignore.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, they'll
go for the questions.

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But you have learned how
to get that information up

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.525 align:middle line:84%
to your conscious mind so
that you're aware of it.

00:36:57.525 --> 00:36:59.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a movie
a couple of years ago based

00:36:59.805 --> 00:37:03.860 align:middle line:84%
on a book called "The
Men Who Stare at Goats."

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.580 align:middle line:84%
It was about the
remote viewing program

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that you were
probably in, right?

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Lyn Cassady
was actually a compilation

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:16.360 align:middle line:90%
of many characters.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Played by Clooney.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Played
by George Clooney

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:90%
over about a 22-year period.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.480 align:middle line:84%
All of those things that
were in the movie happened.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, it starts
out, you wouldn't

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:84%
believe how much of
this is actually true.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Those things actually happened.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.910 align:middle line:90%
I didn't kill the goat.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I killed $50 million
worth of computers,

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.210 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't kill the goat.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.900 align:middle line:84%
That was another
sergeant who did that.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:90%


00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:49.944 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it is
scarily easy to do.

00:37:49.944 --> 00:37:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It really is.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a
quick look at the clip.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.938 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:37:52.938 --> 00:37:53.550 align:middle line:90%


00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Hooper and Holtz wanted
me to do an experiment.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.812 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me to stop
the heart of a goat.

00:37:58.812 --> 00:38:00.270 align:middle line:84%
What had that goat
ever done to me?

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:03.534 align:middle line:84%
It was completely against
the way of the Jedi.

00:38:03.534 --> 00:38:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I was just going
to pretend to try

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.170 align:middle line:84%
so that they could
see it wouldn't work

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:07.646 align:middle line:90%
and they would forget about it.

00:38:07.646 --> 00:38:14.780 align:middle line:84%
But then, as I sat there, I
felt this pulse inside me,

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.550 align:middle line:90%
couldn't stop it.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:19.001 align:middle line:90%


00:38:19.001 --> 00:38:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe deep down inside,
some dark part of me

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.074 align:middle line:90%
wanted to see if I could do it.

00:38:25.074 --> 00:38:28.038 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:28.038 --> 00:38:48.370 align:middle line:90%


00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.867 align:middle line:90%
>>Holy shit.

00:38:50.867 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How easy is it
to do something like that?

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Very easy to do.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.960 align:middle line:84%
You've seen people who
can be driving along,

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.566 align:middle line:84%
and the street lights go out
or the street light come on.

00:39:01.566 --> 00:39:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Quite a bit.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: That's 240
volts going through wires.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:12.969 align:middle line:84%
0.016 volts goes from
the brain to the heart.

00:39:12.969 --> 00:39:15.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think that if
you're going to stop the heart,

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:84%
you squeeze it or mentally
squeeze it or do something

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.440 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:24.035 align:middle line:84%
Stop that voltage and the
heart stops and they die.

00:39:24.035 --> 00:39:24.660 align:middle line:90%
It's that easy.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.201 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have we
done that to people?

00:39:26.201 --> 00:39:29.780 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.989 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: This is where
I change the subject.

00:39:31.989 --> 00:39:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now we're getting
into a gray area, aren't we?

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: This is where
I change the subject.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:84%
The Russians have
done this to people.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Nina Kulagina was
developing this technique,

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.610 align:middle line:84%
stopping the hearts
of rats and frogs

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:48.012 align:middle line:84%
and rabbits and
things like that.

00:39:48.012 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With you mind?

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.345 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: With
your mind, yeah.

00:39:50.345 --> 00:39:54.120 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.120 --> 00:40:01.030 align:middle line:84%
If you know the steps to
take, it's scarily easy to do.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.605 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:40:01.605 --> 00:40:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to come back to
that in a second, Lyn.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.560 align:middle line:84%
In school, I used to
sit behind somebody.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'd always want to get
their attention from the back.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And I would concentrate
on their head.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
think, all right.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Turn around.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Turn around.

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Nine out of ten times,
they would turn around.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's
natural or whether I did this.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:27.460 align:middle line:90%
But it was really strange.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.635 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, listen.

00:40:28.635 --> 00:40:30.832 align:middle line:84%
I have never looked
at a really cute girl

00:40:30.832 --> 00:40:31.790 align:middle line:90%
without getting caught.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:34.410 align:middle line:90%


00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Better to do it
with remote viewing, right?

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.581 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Well,
I still get caught.

00:40:38.581 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's easier.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:46.750 align:middle line:84%
But this ability to
effectively assassinate someone

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.840 align:middle line:90%
could be done this way.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.190 align:middle line:84%
I always thought, too,
that we had a program where

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:55.640 align:middle line:84%
we would send somebody like
you into their dream state

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.640 align:middle line:90%
to do something as a soldier.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.590 align:middle line:90%
Not as Lyn the civilian.

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:03.120 align:middle line:84%
But have we had
programs like that

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to, where we've tried to
get into their dreams?

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Once again,
I think it's time

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:10.462 align:middle line:90%
to change the subject.

00:41:10.462 --> 00:41:12.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're still under
that oath, aren't you?

00:41:12.545 --> 00:41:14.535 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I
believe in secrets.

00:41:14.535 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:90%


00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:23.270 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of secrets
that should be secret.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about it, and--
I mean, this is a show.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:32.061 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to watch this show?

00:41:32.061 --> 00:41:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lots of people.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Lots of
people in a lot of places.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.605 align:middle line:90%
And I believe in secrets.

00:41:39.605 --> 00:41:42.190 align:middle line:90%


00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like a dangerous
thing to play with, too.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Somebody at home.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Kids, be careful.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.960 align:middle line:84%
The thing is-- you know the
old saying, what goes around

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.840 align:middle line:90%
comes around?

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.800 align:middle line:84%
In order to do
this, you go through

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.990 align:middle line:90%
the collective consciousness.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:59.210 align:middle line:84%
You're a part of that
collective consciousness.

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And you hurt somebody,
you hurt yourself.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.890 align:middle line:84%
You help somebody,
you help yourself.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You help yourself.

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:05.440 align:middle line:90%
I've always believed that.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Karma.

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: And it's true.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely true.

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Goes by the name karma, goes
by the name of what goes

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.890 align:middle line:90%
around comes around.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:16.480 align:middle line:84%
You start hurting other people,
you're going to hurt yourself.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.313 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've heard
it comes back to you

00:42:18.313 --> 00:42:19.720 align:middle line:90%
maybe 10 times worse.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.156 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I would say so
because you're closer to it.

00:42:22.156 --> 00:42:23.280 align:middle line:90%
You're closer to the cause.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:23.779 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:23.779 --> 00:42:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about
what's out there that does this?

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:30.137 align:middle line:90%
That penalizes you for that?

00:42:30.137 --> 00:42:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I think
it's just the fact

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:35.820 align:middle line:84%
that you are a part of the
collective consciousness.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And so you hurt the
collective consciousness,

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.580 align:middle line:90%
you're going to hurt yourself.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have
you enjoyed about what

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.930 align:middle line:84%
you've done in your
career-- with the military,

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.140 align:middle line:90%
as a civilian.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.130 align:middle line:84%
You still use remote viewing
in your day-to-day life.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I do.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.410 align:middle line:90%
And I've enjoyed helping people.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, listen.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:00.400 align:middle line:84%
You help bring home a missing
child, years' worth of work

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.220 align:middle line:90%
is worth it.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure is.

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:04.674 align:middle line:90%
And alive, right?

00:43:04.674 --> 00:43:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: And alive.

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:09.130 align:middle line:90%
When that is capable.

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a thing to find a
missing child in Spotsylvania.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:19.260 align:middle line:90%


00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And they had me do the session,
had me describe the child.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And I did and told where
she was going to be.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they showed
me the child's picture.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's
not who I described.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.880 align:middle line:84%
The next day, they
went to the place

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.400 align:middle line:84%
where I had described and found
a body of a child that they

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:44.117 align:middle line:90%
didn't know was missing.

00:43:44.117 --> 00:43:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the sad
part of what you do.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It's the sad part.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's part of it.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.260 align:middle line:90%
This is a responsibility.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.460 align:middle line:90%
This is not a toy.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And I know tea-leaf
remote viewers

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and, you know--
this is not you will

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:04.300 align:middle line:90%
meet a tall, dark stranger.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can it be abused?

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.090 align:middle line:90%
And it can be misused.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.512 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you use it
for picking horse races?

00:44:14.512 --> 00:44:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Sure.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Winning the lottery?

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:20.300 align:middle line:84%
There is a form of the
controlled remote viewing

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.130 align:middle line:84%
called associative
remote viewing, which

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:25.880 align:middle line:90%
is really good at that.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I taught that to
one of my students.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And so, I guess about three or
four months later, he called.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I won the
pick three lottery.

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I got $250.

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Hey, great.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Been practicing.

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Called me another month.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I won it
again and all that.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And after about the third time,
I didn't hear from him again.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was at a conference
one time, and he was there.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, I
haven't heard from you.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Are you still doing the ARB
or Associative Remote Viewing?

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:03.760 align:middle line:90%
He got very defensive.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.990 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:07.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that anymore.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in a rush,
so please excuse me.

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had to get
away from you, huh?

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: In his Maserati.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The lottery--
something hit big.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Something
hit big, yeah.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.550 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, you can do it.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:25.540 align:middle line:84%
But we use the analogy
of the gold ring.

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.080 align:middle line:84%
You find a gold
ring in your yard,

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.610 align:middle line:84%
you're going to tell everybody
else about it and all that.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.697 align:middle line:84%
You dig a little deeper and
you find a chest full of gold--

00:45:32.697 --> 00:45:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't tell anybody.

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: You
don't tell anybody.

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the people who are really
having the success with ARB,

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.729 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to hear about it.

00:45:41.729 --> 00:45:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've gone to
Vegas every once in awhile.

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.860 align:middle line:90%
And I play a little blackjack.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And you sit there,
and you say, I

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:51.690 align:middle line:84%
know the deal is going to
flip up an ace and a king.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:52.810 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:54.500 align:middle line:90%
And they do.

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And you sit back going, how
in the heck did this happen?

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling, Lyn.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:05.460 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is so
strong in you, you just feel it.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Is that what part of this is?

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Part of it, yeah.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I know one time the
psychic part happened.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.800 align:middle line:84%
I was walking
through the casino.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
other remote viewers

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:22.790 align:middle line:84%
was sitting at
the roulette table

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and just turned
around said, hey, Lyn.

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:27.660 align:middle line:90%
What color is coming up next?

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.760 align:middle line:84%
They were betting red
and black and all that.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.730 align:middle line:90%
And I said green.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:33.670 align:middle line:90%
They bet big on the green.

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:38.290 align:middle line:84%
The green came up, paid
36 to one, you know?

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:40.665 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know there was a
green slot on a roulette wheel?

00:46:40.665 --> 00:46:41.498 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You didn't?

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: No, I just--
I thought I was joking.

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've got a
zero and a double zero.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:45.578 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:46:45.578 --> 00:46:47.220 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't gamble.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.430 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, they won big.

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:55.540 align:middle line:84%
The applications of
remote viewing, in one's

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.620 align:middle line:84%
day-to-day life-- because
this is important.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody has
been in the military.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody's going
to be in the military.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
a wonderful tool

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:08.780 align:middle line:90%
to be able to use in your life.

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:09.696 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It is.

00:47:09.696 --> 00:47:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
train someone to do this?

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:14.810 align:middle line:90%


00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I can train anyone
to do this except for three

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:21.610 align:middle line:90%
different kinds of people.

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:26.120 align:middle line:84%
But the training just
teaches you what to do.

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:30.520 align:middle line:84%
If you don't practice,
you're wasting my time.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.820 align:middle line:84%
You're wasting your
own time and all that.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.370 align:middle line:90%
You're wasting your money.

00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:37.970 align:middle line:90%
It's in practicing.

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:40.710 align:middle line:84%
You learn what to do, and you
practice, practice, practice,

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:41.860 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like
any martial art.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:50.990 align:middle line:84%
You go to three days
of karate school

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:54.225 align:middle line:84%
and you don't practice,
don't get in a fight.

00:47:54.225 --> 00:47:55.100 align:middle line:90%
You're going to lose.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same with
the remote viewing.

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are the three
kinds of people you can't teach?

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: A
natural psychic who

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:06.730 align:middle line:84%
is really a natural
psychic and good at it.

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:08.206 align:middle line:90%
They don't need this.

00:48:08.206 --> 00:48:12.310 align:middle line:84%
This was developed for
people who aren't psychic.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:20.670 align:middle line:84%
The kind of person who has the
fundamental religion so deeply

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.485 align:middle line:84%
ingrained that anything psychic
is going to send you to hell.

00:48:23.485 --> 00:48:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:25.830 align:middle line:90%
It's evil.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And even
when they succeed at it,

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:32.210 align:middle line:90%
they will reject it.

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:36.860 align:middle line:84%
The other kind is
the avid psychic

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.620 align:middle line:90%
who everything is psychic.

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:41.140 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the breeze blows today.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.912 align:middle line:84%
That means we should
have world peace.

00:48:46.912 --> 00:48:47.620 align:middle line:90%
Things like this.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Everything is psychic.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:53.340 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
the discrimination

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.750 align:middle line:84%
to actually sit
down and do a thing.

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Part of the
remote-viewing process,

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:02.890 align:middle line:84%
the controlled remote viewing
process, is error correction.

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:06.480 align:middle line:84%
A large part of it is
getting rid of the trash

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.510 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to get
trash as well as good stuff.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And the process is
developed in such a way

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.300 align:middle line:84%
that you automatically throw
the trash out as you go.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
a discerning ability

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and whatever comes to mind is
psychic and you believe it,

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.150 align:middle line:90%
can't teach you.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does it
take to teach somebody?

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I have
a three-day class.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.899 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:49:30.899 --> 00:49:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty intense.

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: That's very intense.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And because it's intense, you're
not going to learn it all.

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I make a deal
with my own students

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:48.020 align:middle line:84%
that from then on for
the rest of my life,

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:49.870 align:middle line:90%
you have free consultation.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:51.424 align:middle line:90%
You have my phone number.

00:49:51.424 --> 00:49:52.590 align:middle line:90%
I'll help you with projects.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.375 align:middle line:90%
I'll help you with everything.

00:49:54.375 --> 00:49:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's like a
warranty for life, isn't it?

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:57.248 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:49:57.248 --> 00:50:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm an old
country East Texan.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody pays you
do some work, you do it.

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do the work.

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And if they hire
me to learn remote viewing

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and it takes a lifetime,
then I'm obligated.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I obligate myself to take
my lifetime to teach them.

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you seen
some incredible students?

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Fantastic
students, yeah.

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.790 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some that-- I've
seen some natural psychics,

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:36.550 align:middle line:84%
good natural psychics who
came to learn the controls,

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:38.410 align:middle line:90%
not the viewing.

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And they come to
learn the controls.

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.890 align:middle line:90%
And I watch them work.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:44.650 align:middle line:84%
This is during the
first three days.

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And I look at them,
and I think, on my best

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.725 align:middle line:90%
day I couldn't do that well.

00:50:50.725 --> 00:50:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
are really good.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They pick
it up fast, then.

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: They
pick it up very fast.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:54.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:54.730 --> 00:50:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can remote
viewing be used negatively?

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: You can hurt
people with it, especially

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.910 align:middle line:84%
with the remote
influencing, which

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:10.550 align:middle line:84%
is a takeoff of the
controlled remote viewing.

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a thing that
is responsible.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.760 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely not a toy.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.849 align:middle line:84%
But you can hurt
people by giving them

00:51:20.849 --> 00:51:21.765 align:middle line:90%
the wrong information.

00:51:21.765 --> 00:51:24.320 align:middle line:90%


00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.200 align:middle line:90%
You know-- oh, yeah.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow afternoon
you're going to be fine.

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Or you can say, oh,
the kid is dead.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.085 align:middle line:84%
And like you say,
five years later--

00:51:34.085 --> 00:51:35.168 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The kid shows up.

00:51:35.168 --> 00:51:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: The kid shows up.

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
do your job right,

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:45.130 align:middle line:84%
if you don't throw out the trash
and keep just the good stuff,

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't do your job
responsibly as a remote viewer,

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:55.610 align:middle line:84%
it's possible to hurt
people by giving them

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:57.750 align:middle line:90%
the wrong information.

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you, in a
remote viewing process,

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:05.870 align:middle line:90%
influence somebody?

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're
interested in a companion.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:middle line:90%
And you see someone.

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And you want to get
your mind into her mind.

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: In the remote
viewing process, no.

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:25.060 align:middle line:84%
There is a takeoff, one
point that Ingo created--

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The late Ingo Swann.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: The late Ingo Swann.

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.920 align:middle line:90%
He never really pushed this.

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But one point in the controlled
remote viewing process,

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:40.170 align:middle line:84%
there is a takeoff that leads
into remote influencing, which

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:42.539 align:middle line:90%
is very powerful.

00:52:42.539 --> 00:52:43.330 align:middle line:90%
If you don't have--

00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:44.465 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a great tool.

00:52:44.465 --> 00:52:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
have good ethics,

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I would say, please
stay out of this.

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:57.320 align:middle line:84%
If you're not a moral person,
please stay out of it.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:01.510 align:middle line:84%
But I don't teach the
remote influencing.

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:02.882 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On purpose?

00:53:02.882 --> 00:53:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: On purpose.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:07.560 align:middle line:84%
I teach a medical
applications course,

00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:11.190 align:middle line:84%
where I teach you how
to convince someone

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.990 align:middle line:90%
to heal themself.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:14.660 align:middle line:90%


00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From anything?

00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Cancer--

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Well, anything
that you-- you lose an arm,

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:23.202 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
heal yourself from that.

00:53:23.202 --> 00:53:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you could--

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.826 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: If you
could, it'd be great.

00:53:25.826 --> 00:53:27.472 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure would.

00:53:27.472 --> 00:53:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But I don't teach the
remote influencing.

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because it's dangerous?

00:53:34.725 --> 00:53:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Not
because it's dangerous.

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:40.420 align:middle line:84%
It's because I know that
since I have learned it,

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.960 align:middle line:84%
there have been many
times when I was really

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.950 align:middle line:84%
tempted to use it for less
than honorable purposes.

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got upset
with somebody or somebody did

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:50.242 align:middle line:90%
you wrong?

00:53:50.242 --> 00:53:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:51.533 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:53:51.533 --> 00:53:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And I just don't
want to hand guns to children.

00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it works.

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But as we've talked about, it
can also come back negatively

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:05.210 align:middle line:90%
on you.

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: That's right.

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.305 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:54:06.305 --> 00:54:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:11.340 align:middle line:84%
But in learning
that the hard way,

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.580 align:middle line:90%
you also hurt other people.

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.430 align:middle line:90%
So I don't teach it.

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:17.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel good about
teaching that to anyone.

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost as if
limits like good and evil.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:23.770 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
God and the devil,

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:27.930 align:middle line:84%
where the devil's got
incredible powers.

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:31.270 align:middle line:90%
Make no mistake about that.

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's a checks
and balance, I think,

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.720 align:middle line:90%
between good and evil.

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.709 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like this
is the same thing.

00:54:37.709 --> 00:54:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It really is.

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:41.950 align:middle line:90%
It takes ethics.

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And if I have a student that
I don't think is ethical,

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:50.780 align:middle line:90%
I'll cut off their teaching.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.067 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And bounce them?

00:54:52.067 --> 00:54:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I bounce them.

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:55.320 align:middle line:90%
I won't teach them any further.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:59.110 align:middle line:84%
In the basic course, you
learn how to remote view.

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:01.280 align:middle line:84%
In the intermediate
course, you learn

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.850 align:middle line:84%
how to remote view and get
fine, fine, fine details.

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:11.730 align:middle line:84%
This is where you learn how to
go into a piece of equipment

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and draw the cogs and the
gears and everything else.

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:20.500 align:middle line:84%
In the advanced
course, you learn

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:22.920 align:middle line:84%
how to draw the floor
plans of the place

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.950 align:middle line:84%
where the hostage is held,
how to draw timelines

00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and all this other stuff.

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And if I get the feeling
that a student does not

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:36.790 align:middle line:84%
have good ethics, I cut them
off at the basic course.

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:38.232 align:middle line:90%
And they want to go further--

00:55:38.232 --> 00:55:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
smart on your part.

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Well, I think
it's responsible on my part.

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:44.910 align:middle line:90%
It's part of my ethics.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, my higher
classes are full,

00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:49.660 align:middle line:90%
can't take any more students.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.820 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of
cultures that are practicing

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:56.826 align:middle line:90%
this in different ways.

00:55:56.826 --> 00:55:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, sure.

00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, like I would
think a voodoo practitioner is

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:03.370 align:middle line:84%
doing remote viewing
when they get

00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:05.695 align:middle line:84%
the little doll and the
figurine and things like that.

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: They're
doing psychic work.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, yeah, they're
remote viewing because they're

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:16.660 align:middle line:84%
using their physical objects and
their body interacting with it.

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And so in that respect,
yeah, it is remote viewing

00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:26.070 align:middle line:84%
because their body is acting
as a-- even the people who

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:28.670 align:middle line:84%
dance and dance and twirl and
twirl and twirl until they're

00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:29.372 align:middle line:90%
in a state.

00:56:29.372 --> 00:56:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Until they pass out.

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But the whole thing that
differentiates remote viewing

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:41.980 align:middle line:84%
from psychic work is that
the body is actively involved

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.410 align:middle line:90%
in the translation process.

00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a old story
of why Native American rain

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.860 align:middle line:90%
dances work.

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said it's because
they never stop dancing.

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: That's right.

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.430 align:middle line:84%
They don't stop dancing
until it starts raining.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
future or remote viewing?

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:04.114 align:middle line:84%
Are there techniques that
can make this even better?

00:57:04.114 --> 00:57:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yes.

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:07.250 align:middle line:90%
And we're learning all the time.

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Now that it's out into
the civilian area,

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.830 align:middle line:84%
everybody's got their own
remote viewing method.

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And some people are coming up
with some pretty good stuff.

00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't looked at the
future of remote viewing.

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:27.460 align:middle line:84%
The future's not
what it used to be.

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:33.400 align:middle line:84%
The results I kept getting
every time I looked

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:37.222 align:middle line:84%
was that-- you know the
kid who killed himself

00:57:37.222 --> 00:57:38.680 align:middle line:84%
over rock and roll
and the kid that

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.540 align:middle line:84%
killed himself
over the hula hoop

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.340 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff?

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.800 align:middle line:84%
That same kid is going to kill
himself over remote viewing.

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And preachers will
preach against it.

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Teachers will teach against it.

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:52.605 align:middle line:90%
It'll be a newspaper article.

00:57:52.605 --> 00:57:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an evil tool.

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Evil tool.

00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And it'll go out
of the public back

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.650 align:middle line:84%
into the government in
greatly increased ability.

00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I kept
finding out about it,

00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:11.530 align:middle line:84%
that, again, what goes
around comes around.

00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And they'll have the
remote viewing witch

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.680 align:middle line:90%
trials and all that.

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And then that will go away.

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:26.120 align:middle line:84%
But the military will have a
phenomenal spying technique.

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you miss
being in the military?

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I do.

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:33.510 align:middle line:84%
When I came out into
the civilian arena,

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I got a job as a
programmer and found out

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that in the civilian arena,
it's not mission-oriented.

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.310 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:50.226 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: It's stab
your partner in the back

00:58:50.226 --> 00:58:52.850 align:middle line:84%
so that you get the raise
rather than your partner.

00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:55.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's really dog-eat-dog.

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:58.115 align:middle line:84%
And after 20 years
in the military

00:58:58.115 --> 00:59:03.970 align:middle line:84%
of being mission-oriented,
I wasn't prepared for that.

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
effectively declassified

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:12.650 align:middle line:84%
the remote viewing, I started
getting, like, 80 calls.

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:14.910 align:middle line:90%
I was the trainer in the unit.

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I started getting, like, 80
calls a day for training.

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, hey,
this computer company

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:24.390 align:middle line:90%
can go its own way without me.

00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:30.362 align:middle line:84%
And I got my company, PSI,
into the remote viewing.

00:59:30.362 --> 00:59:31.403 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great name, too.

00:59:31.403 --> 00:59:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Great name.

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:34.520 align:middle line:84%
You said that your
temper sometimes

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.744 align:middle line:84%
would get the best of
you in remote viewing.

00:59:37.744 --> 00:59:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Not
in remote viewing.

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.450 align:middle line:90%
In PK.

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:43.050 align:middle line:90%


00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Out of your
control or in your control?

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: The PK,
the psychokinesis?

00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:51.510 align:middle line:84%
When I get angry, it's
out of my control.

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So that's dangerous.

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:55.732 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: It's
dangerous, very.

00:59:55.732 --> 01:00:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But in the remote
viewing, sometimes

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:09.140 align:middle line:84%
if you know how to use the
techniques to use your emotions

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:14.100 align:middle line:84%
as a remote-viewing tool,
which is an advanced thing,

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:18.480 align:middle line:84%
then you can use those as
tools to gain information

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.490 align:middle line:90%
about the target.

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Must you always write
things down in remote viewing?

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:24.374 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yes.

01:00:24.374 --> 01:00:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a necessity.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.248 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:28.230 align:middle line:84%
You're going to forget
it if you don't.

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:31.090 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the session,
when you write your summary,

01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:32.800 align:middle line:90%
you've forgotten all that stuff.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And also, the act
of writing it down

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:43.550 align:middle line:84%
is a physical response to
a subconscious knowledge.

01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the act of writing it
down-- if you don't write it

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
down, at some point
your subconscious, which

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.057 align:middle line:84%
has a personality of its
own, is going to say, hey,

01:00:53.057 --> 01:00:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you all this stuff,
and you're not writing it down.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

01:00:57.450 --> 01:01:00.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you do write
it down, at some point

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.500 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious
says, that idiot's

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.550 align:middle line:90%
writing this stuff down.

01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.077 align:middle line:90%
I'd better get on the stick.

01:01:05.077 --> 01:01:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And as
you write stuff down,

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.540 align:middle line:84%
you get better and better
contact with your subconscious

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:15.470 align:middle line:90%
and with the sight.

01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And the viewing gets better
and better and better.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.950 align:middle line:84%
This is why every single
session starts off

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
with just coordinates and doing
ideograms and things and winds

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:33.390 align:middle line:84%
up, an hour later, knowing
exactly what's in the envelope

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
or exactly what's
going on or exactly how

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to draw the picture
that's on a classified

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.782 align:middle line:84%
document in a secure
facility in the Kremlin.

01:01:45.782 --> 01:01:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a new crop
of remote viewers coming up?

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: In the
civilian world, yes.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.220 align:middle line:90%
And some very, very good ones.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Now, you
don't hear about them

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
too often because they're
working for companies.

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And companies have
non-disclosure agreements

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.630 align:middle line:90%
and such as that.

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Also, companies want exclusive
rights to the information.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And so most of what you hear
on the internet-- I'd say over

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.260 align:middle line:84%
90% of what you hear
on the internet--

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:23.747 align:middle line:84%
is people dabbling in this,
trying to prove that it works.

01:02:23.747 --> 01:02:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, We know it works.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: We did
that 25 years ago.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:27.643 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We know it works.

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:30.572 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And they're
still dabbling in it,

01:02:30.572 --> 01:02:32.280 align:middle line:84%
still trying to learn
it, still coming up

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
with their own
theories and all that.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.140 align:middle line:10%
So when you read
about remote viewing

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.240 align:middle line:10%
on the internet,
first of all, that's

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.235 align:middle line:10%
not the same thing at all as
controlled remote viewing.

01:02:43.235 --> 01:02:43.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:44.960 align:middle line:10%
Two different things.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.930 align:middle line:10%
>>BUCHANAN: And
second of all, it's

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:53.335 align:middle line:10%
mainly people who are
learning and trying

01:02:53.335 --> 01:02:54.210 align:middle line:10%
to figure things out.

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you, Lyn,

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.440 align:middle line:84%
if they want to
practice with you?

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: My website
is crviewer.com.

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:03.360 align:middle line:90%


01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.684 align:middle line:10%
Lyn, thanks for being on--

01:03:05.684 --> 01:03:06.600 align:middle line:10%
>>BUCHANAN: Thank you.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --"Beyond Belief."

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.260 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: It's
good talking to you.

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The subject
of remote viewing,

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
controlled remote viewing, is
something I've been interested

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:14.210 align:middle line:90%
in all my life.

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:18.340 align:middle line:10%
And to talk to experts
like Lyn Buchanan

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:21.990 align:middle line:10%
is so important to further
my own personal studies.

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:23.850 align:middle line:10%
And I hope you learned
something, too.

01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:26.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
