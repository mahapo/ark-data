>>GEORGE NOORY: What
does cosmic DNA mean?

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EVA MARQUEZ: The cosmic DNA
is that sleeping DNA within us,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.280 align:middle line:84%
is that spark of God that
every single one of us has.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so we carry the ancestral
DNA from our genetic family.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:84%
But we also carry
our soul mind DNA.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.350 align:middle line:84%
There are many other aspects
of the language of light,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
as colors, sound, numbers,
and geometric shapes.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:84%
They are multi-dimensional
because in our meditations,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:84%
we can reach these
multidimensional places.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:84%
That means if as
far as we can reach,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.735 align:middle line:84%
so deep we can go
within our body.

00:00:48.735 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: Well, welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:10%
Eva Marquez is with us, author
of "Activate Your Cosmic DNA."

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:10%
She's also a healer spiritual
consultant and a teacher

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:10%
with a strong connection to
the Pleiades star system,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:10%
her mission is to
help humanity evolve

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:10%
from a mindset of survival
to being multidimensional.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Eva, welcome to the program.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Thank you so
much for inviting me.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me how you
got involved in cosmic DNA?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:90%
How did you learn this?

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:10%
>>MARQUEZ: Well, as a child,
I was always curious child.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle line:10%
And I always believe
there's much more

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:10%
than just the human life that
we have here on the Earth.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And so over the time as
I grew up and learned

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:84%
for the-- searched
for the answers

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and going through my personal
ups and down through life,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I became very interested in the
Pleiades and all this topic.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:10%
And that became my life journey.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Have you had
help and assistance?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:10%
>>MARQUEZ: I had the
assistance of my guide.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.308 align:middle line:84%
If I can count to help,
I had the Lyme disease,

00:01:52.308 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:84%
which was the biggest help
to me on this journey.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got it
from an infected tick.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.832 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes.

00:01:57.832 --> 00:01:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you cured?

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: I'm cured.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:90%
I found a healing.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I actually learned the
healing and started

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.585 align:middle line:84%
to pursue all this journey
of finding the answers.

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
had you had that?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.784 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: About 14 years ago.

00:02:08.784 --> 00:02:09.989 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yeah.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:84%
That was the
life-changing moment.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a lot of
people can't get rid of it.

00:02:14.032 --> 00:02:16.195 align:middle line:84%
You are remarkable to
be able to do that.

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: I'd hope.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
cosmic DNA mean.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
The cosmic DNA is that
sleeping DNA within us.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.030 align:middle line:84%
It's that spark of God that
every single one of us has.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And it has so much of
answers waiting for us.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me more.

00:02:31.645 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: There's just
so much to go around it.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So we know that we
have that sleeping DNA.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And that sleeping DNA
has been passed to us

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
through our
extraterrestrial ancestors

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:84%
or those alien ancestors
as we talk about.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
fascinating journey

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.130 align:middle line:84%
to start exploring
it and looking at it.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:90%
What does it really mean for us?

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:90%
And how can we awaken it?

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And how can we find a
way to understand it,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle line:84%
sort of making that beautiful,
mystical extraterrestrials

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.315 align:middle line:90%
normal in the 21st century?

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the
cosmic DNA different

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.920 align:middle line:90%
from normal human DNA?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: It is not different.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:90%
It's actually the same.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
The difference between the
cosmic DNA and the human DNA

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:84%
is that we as humans are
not aware of that cosmic DNA

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:84%
We still do not know what to do
with it or how to, let's say,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
trigger it that we will activate
our self-healing abilities.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what does
cosmic DNA do for us?

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: The
cosmic DNA will help

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.230 align:middle line:84%
us to evolve into
multi-dimensional spaces

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:90%
because we are getting there.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
We would like to live
under different planets

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:90%
and different places.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But for that we have to
change not only spiritually,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
but we have to also
change physically.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And by understanding
the DNA and literally

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.690 align:middle line:84%
finding that cosmic DNA within
us will help us to do it.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we all have
cosmic DNA within us?

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of us?

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Absolutely.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Now all the ancient
book speaks about

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
that body is a microcosm
of the macrocosm.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:84%
That itself suggests that,
yes, they do have a cosmic DNA.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
We are actually
the cosmic beings.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did we get
it in the first place?

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: I believe that every
single one of us carry it.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
We carry it from that
beautiful glob of the light

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
or the God, the source of
the God that we came through

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and they carry it
in our incarnation.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But we also get that little jump
quantum speed on our journey

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:84%
through the ancient
aliens as we know

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
of the stories of the
Anunnaki in ancient Sumeria

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
where there has
been definitely DNA

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:90%
genetic modification going on.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:84%
That's literally our cosmic
DNA, catch the little bit

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:84%
of that jet stream
or the quantum speed

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that we are literally
discovering today and learning

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:90%
to understand today.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
convinced that we were

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.540 align:middle line:90%
seeded by extraterrestrials.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, I also
believe that some of us

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:90%
are extraterrestrials.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Full?

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Well, depends, we are
all incarnated into human body.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you?

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.205 align:middle line:90%
Am I?

00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:15.945 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Why not?

00:05:15.945 --> 00:05:16.805 align:middle line:90%
We are such--

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:18.708 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how
would we know that?

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: How do we know that.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that's actually
a very simple answer.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So the people who
read the past lives.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
They're the people who can tune
in our soul-mind consciousness

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and they can trace these
past lives all the way down

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:84%
to the day, let's
say, ancient Egypt.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And some of them feel it all
the way before the Earth,

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
before we were born on the
Earth or before we first landed

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:90%
in the spaceship on the Earth.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.165 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:05:46.165 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: That suggests that
we are extraterrestrial species.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So we're star seeds?

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.460 align:middle line:84%
They also had a life
prior Earth our stars.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The fact that we
have this cosmic DNA within us

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:90%
what does that do for us?

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.453 align:middle line:90%
Anything special?

00:06:05.453 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: It gives us that
what we call today the special

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.805 align:middle line:84%
abilities, the
self-healing abilities--

00:06:09.805 --> 00:06:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it give
us intuitiveness?

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Intuitiveness,
the remote viewing abilities,

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:84%
for example, clear
sentience abilities.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.010 align:middle line:84%
It'll actually even
activate our ability of work

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.160 align:middle line:84%
toward the ability that we
are able to time travel.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.505 align:middle line:84%
It's all built
within this body it's

00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:84%
like most sophisticated tool
or the machine that we have.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there any danger
to having this cosmic DNA

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:90%
within us?

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: The danger
would be misusing it

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.490 align:middle line:90%
and we are responsible for it.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:84%
We have to make a choice
how we use our abilities.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How would we misuse it?

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: To misuse
it will be to,

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
let's say focus only on
the mind development.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So we know they are in
this age of the fast

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.350 align:middle line:84%
forward technological
evolution, which

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:84%
can be very easily outsourced
to the mind and the computer

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:90%
and the artificial intelligence.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And that could be a danger
possible in the future.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
However, if we continue
the same pathway

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and we connect it to our
heart and really connect

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
the essence of our beautiful
soul with our amazing mind,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.500 align:middle line:84%
that's how we use
it in the right way.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you find out
that you were a star seed?

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Were you told this?

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: I had this
interesting experience.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, as a little child when
I was about two or three years

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:84%
old, I would draw a spaceship
under my mother's sofa--

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just doodling.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Just doodling.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And making sure that there's
the blueprint of the spaceship,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.360 align:middle line:84%
which I didn't think about
much until later on in life,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:90%
I start to think about it.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:84%
I saw the UFO about
three times in my life.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
However, it wasn't until I
started like many spiritual

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:84%
to people to explore
my journey and try

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.460 align:middle line:90%
to connect with my guide.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So one day I felt this presence
of the being beside me.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And this being said, Pleiades.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what Pleiades was.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:90%
So I ran and I search it.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And then this beautiful
constellation came back.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And with that came this
flow of the memories.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's what cosmic
DNA does for us.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to remember to
awaken the memories within us.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually to that
emotional part of us.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a spiritual
aspect of this cosmic DNA

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:26.633 align:middle line:90%
within us?

00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Absolutely.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So the spiritual aspect is
the essence of that soul.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:84%
The physical aspect of our
DNA is that we are creators,

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.919 align:middle line:90%
that we can create.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Now everything in the world
here works into dualities.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:84%
So we have a physical
and we have a spiritual.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:84%
So the spiritual
aspect of our DNA,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:84%
it's coming to that
awakening of the soul

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and be responsible
for where we are going

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and what we are learning, what
are we're going to do with it?

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what Theresa Bullard
on Gaia's Mystery Teachings

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.335 align:middle line:84%
talked about, the
potential of DNA.

00:08:57.335 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:10%
>>TERESA BULLARD: Now here
are the practical things

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:10%
that impact our DNA
that we have the power

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.070 align:middle line:10%
to change if we choose.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.290 align:middle line:90%
First our environment.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
What we breathe, what
we eat and drink,

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle line:84%
the products we put on our
skin, the lifestyle choices

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and habits, our stress
levels, all of this

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:90%
affects chemistry in the body.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:90%
Second our mental beliefs.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Our expectations, thoughts,
attitudes, what we focus on,

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.260 align:middle line:84%
this all ties in to the quantum
observer effect as well.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Third, our emotional attitudes.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:84%
The HeartMath Institute
published a study in 2003

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:84%
that showed when a person
is experiencing motions

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:84%
of a low vibration, such as fear
or worry, their DNA tightens up

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:84%
or contracts, which
then restricts access

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:90%
to the genetic potential.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if they
experience a high vibration

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
such as love, joy, gratitude,
their DNA relaxes its coil

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and it expands granting access
to more genetic expression.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
This brings us back
to the concepts

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
on expansion and coherence
and how we regulate

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.500 align:middle line:90%
our genetic expression.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The more we expand and achieve
a heightened state of coherence,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.910 align:middle line:84%
the more we can
access our potential.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Now our fourth epigenetic
key are the words we use.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:84%
For better or for worse, our DNA
responds to the words we speak.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Every word we speak goes into
all levels of the DNA system.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:84%
This is why it is so
important to clean up

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.240 align:middle line:84%
our use of words
and frame things

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:84%
in positive and uplifting
words rather than complaining

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
or gossiping or
spreading negativity.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.440 align:middle line:84%
The person who uses
words in a negative way

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:90%
hurts themselves and others.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you
think of that, Eve?

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: It is
absolutely true.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:84%
The way how we think,
how we act, what we do

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:84%
give us a choice to
choose the choice

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.500 align:middle line:84%
to stay in the law
vibrational energy

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:84%
or raise up in that
high vibrational energy.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And that will unlock many
other parts of the DNA

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:84%
that kind of protecting us
in that self-destruction.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
In our human body, we have
an organ called gall bladder

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:90%
that we all know.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
Chinese medicine,

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:84%
the gallbladder gave
us a power to choose

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
how are we going to feel,
what are we're going to do.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:84%
That's literally
a free will zone.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that gallbladder
literally leads us

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:84%
into regulation of our DNA, that
it all leads into the choices

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:84%
are we going to be constructed
and limit that and congested

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:84%
that up there or are we
going to open and explore

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:90%
much more than there is?

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.115 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can anything go wrong
with cosmic DNA within us?

00:11:57.115 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: I don't
think it can go wrong.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:84%
The only way it can
go wrong is if they

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.020 align:middle line:84%
start using the artificial
intelligence to improve

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
our body, then
they would I think

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:84%
affect the natural
evolution, what

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to happen to us.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
different forms

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:84%
of star seeds within us
or just the Pleiades?

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
different forms.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:90%
So there are many stories.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we have 12
founding families or star

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:84%
families who contribute
to the primate DNA

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.980 align:middle line:84%
that the day are the human
beings are because we

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.610 align:middle line:90%
are living in their bodies.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So let's say these
12 families created

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.790 align:middle line:84%
a 13th family, which would
be the human family today.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So we have these 12
particular strands.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Now we all have a cosmic DNA.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you come from Pleiades,
Libra, or other human, but each

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:84%
of these star families is way
evolved than when we are today.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So they carried a special
kind of the ability

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.690 align:middle line:84%
or the nature of
personality that they have.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
contribute to our DNA.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's what make change.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the DNA
put in us from birth?

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:90%
The moment we're born?

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:84%
So we carry the ancestral
DNA from our genetic family,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:84%
but we also carry
our soul-mind DNA.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's say if I
may have experienced

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:84%
the life in the
Pleiades, naturally, I

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
don't carry this DNA
from my birth mother

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:84%
unless she also may have
came from the same line.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:84%
But I believe we can carry
it through our soul-mind

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:45.980 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that
downloads into this DNA

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:90%
created body by the birth.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we pass
it on to our children?

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: We pass on our
children what we learn.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
However, we cannot pass all
this Pleiadean memory that I had

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
on my children because it's
like my past life be passing

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So there will be
tiny bits and pieces.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Our job as somebody who remember
this extraterrestrial DNA

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
for us is to create a way
of life and to teach them.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So we can pass something
from generation to generation

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:84%
but the people will
not understand it

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:84%
if they start to be aware
of what is happening to us

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
then we can teach them and
create a way of their life.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And that is much more
effective and connecting

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:84%
that innovative genetic
predisposition to it,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:90%
that would have a great effect.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a genetic
modification program

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:84%
underway to change
us, to alter us?

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Well,
that's a good question.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.510 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadeans
that I work with or

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.930 align:middle line:84%
the benevolent extraterrestrial
species that I work with,

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:84%
they are guiding us that we
do our DNA modification in

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:00.660 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Not necessary by some
kind of the chemicals

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:84%
or putting something
in our body,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:84%
but by becoming aware of who
we are and helping our develop.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Same as we watch in the video.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:84%
When we become
aware of our choices

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and how they affect our life
that, is the DNA evolution.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't need
anything else for it.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With this
genetic manipulation,

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:84%
how do we know they are doing it
for our benefit and not theirs?

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: That is true.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:84%
However, so when I channel
the reptilian beings

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
from the Orion,
and we do know all

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:84%
that they are good reptilians
and bad reptilians.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They connect
to our first chakra

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:90%
to safety, security.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And they do connect
to our gallbladder,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
which is the main pathway for
the soul-mind consciousness.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Through
the gallbladder.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So the gallbladder
is the something

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:84%
that Pleiadeans taught
me, that is the pathway

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:90%
for the ego-mind consciousness.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Some people have their
gallbladder removed.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.635 align:middle line:90%
What happens to them?

00:16:12.635 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You still have
your meridian pathway.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can still work with
the meridian pathway that

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.940 align:middle line:84%
goes from the head over your
body, down through your leg,

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.500 align:middle line:84%
which actually can connect
to all your seven chakras.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But where I'm going with this
is that if the gallbladder gives

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:84%
us the power of the choices
or in the Chinese medicine,

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:37.320 align:middle line:84%
it connects to this that
we can choose anything

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
we want, then if somebody
help us to genetically modify,

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:84%
to control us, why they
would give us a will choice?

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So what was the
reason the star seed

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:90%
is in us in the first place?

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:90%
To help us?

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Make us better?

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Well, I think
honestly in the first place,

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.920 align:middle line:84%
we need to look
a little bit back

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:84%
before the story
of the Anunnakis.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
We need to go somewhere in
about cross between the Lemuria

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.650 align:middle line:90%
and Atlantis.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Now they all have
seen this picture

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient Egypt when they
are this ancient astronaut's

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:90%
wearing the things.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.010 align:middle line:84%
That mean that somebody
was flying on the Earth

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:84%
and Earth was not necessarily
the best environment

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:25.099 align:middle line:90%
to support their life.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And they really fell
in love on earth.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they had
his healing temples

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and rejuvenating places
and all that stuff.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:84%
However, their
body were not fully

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:90%
compatible with the place.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's how this genetic
modification really originally

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.320 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.510 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't to create the human
race, that was later on.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's have some good
obedient species.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.060 align:middle line:84%
But it was for them, and I
think this can be compared

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:90%
to the mission Mars eventually.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Those who are going
to be living on Mars

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.810 align:middle line:84%
may possibly
encounter a hard time

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
to living in the
dorm communities.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And they will eventually
want to venture out and live

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:90%
a different life.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And if they have sophisticated
technology and medicine

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and the physics, who
find a life on the Mars

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and find it compatible with
that human geniculate body,

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:19.040 align:middle line:84%
that is the beginning of
the genetic modification

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.000 align:middle line:90%
on the Mars.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can forget and thousands
and thousands of years

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:84%
later, we may wonder,
why did they do that?

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:84%
So I do honestly believe
they started to do that

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:90%
just because they needed help.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they our gods?

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: I believe so.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Well, but there
is a question of the gods.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I think the gods are
just the ancient aliens,

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial species.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if they
created us in their image,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:84%
it seems very
biblical, doesn't it?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: It does.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But they were created in the
image of somebody like them

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And a cycle repeats
over and over.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And we look at them
as the gods, why?

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Because the cosmic DNA has
been probably functioning

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:90%
in about 80% or so much on.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:90%
So they appear godly like.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But what if they just
understood their cosmic DNA

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:90%
and how to utilize it?

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.860 align:middle line:84%
What if it's not just
as mystical, but normal?

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matias
De Stefano is part

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.300 align:middle line:90%
of Gaia's program "Initiation."

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about the
modification of humanity

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and what it meant for the
possibility of a galactic race,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.703 align:middle line:84%
maybe even stopping
a galactic war.

00:19:36.703 --> 00:19:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO:
This war that

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:84%
is being held in these three
times in the fourth dimension

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:84%
is calling us from
every dimension

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to be prepared ourselves
not to live it.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why a lot of people is
receiving information and data

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.480 align:middle line:84%
from other levels
of consciousness

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
from Pleiadean people, Sirian
people, Arcturian people

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:84%
to prepare ourselves and
our bodies souls and spirit.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So we could be centered
to love each other,

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
to reunite each other,
to go through the portals

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
of the ninth
dimension from within.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So in such a way,
we prevent the war

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:90%
to happen again in the future.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So the responsibility we should
have today through that war

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
is that we can heal that
war through many dimensions.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
But by healing that war
here in this planet,

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:90%
starting from ourselves.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So the war is something
that is being held within.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:84%
If we make peace in
between our parts

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and we start to be
coherent in our daily life,

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
we are going to be healing
the links we have with others

00:20:55.250 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:84%
that we are fighting with and
the war stops in our families,

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:09.080 align:middle line:84%
the war stops in our culture,
war stops in our species,

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and then when we stop
the wars in our planet,

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:84%
so we create a fractal
of this reality

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.500 align:middle line:90%
towards every other dimension.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So if we do it well, if we do
it properly in this planet,

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:32.340 align:middle line:84%
it will be like a seed to
show to many other beings

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
in other planets that
it is possible to be

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:90%
harmonious with the universe.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Our job here is to remember
that we are every perspective.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And that the only
way you can achieve

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:84%
the ninth and the eighth
dimension is from within.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
That's why we need to know
about all these people

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.260 align:middle line:84%
intelligent beings
around the universe.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And why it's important
to understand

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:90%
our role in the War of Orion.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:84%
We are the seed that
can heal the war

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.590 align:middle line:90%
in between every dimension.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.865 align:middle line:90%
[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:22:17.865 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He seems to have a
pretty good handle on this.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: I love his work.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So the last war is literally
fought inside of us.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.240 align:middle line:84%
We are reminded about these
wars and what happen out there

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.520 align:middle line:90%
within all these dimensions.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And as this memory comes,
especially the Death Star seat,

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.070 align:middle line:90%
we are meant to remember.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And we are last part of it, we
are meant to change ourselves.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:84%
If we find our
soul-mind consciousness,

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:84%
it will literally fight
that last war within us,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:84%
to change ourselves,
to change our ego

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:84%
into this beautiful,
intelligent mind that can easily

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:84%
create lives on the other
planet and eventually see

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:84%
the other planet, same
as we were seeded in.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:90%
There will not be wars anymore.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:84%
There will not be a
need for the control

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:90%
somebody with anybody else.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's why all these
memories are so important.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And so important to
connect to it and says,

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we have been
there, done that.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And we can definitely continue
in that, but if we change.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think there's
anything evil about this.

00:23:25.455 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Well,
we have a choice

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.310 align:middle line:90%
how are we going to look at it.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.880 align:middle line:10%
We can look at it from
the evil point of view

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:10%
and live in the fears.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:10%
Or we can make a
choice to start looking

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:10%
at it from the point
of view of love

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.880 align:middle line:10%
and choose a soul-mind
consciousness.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think,
could make a difference

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:84%
that can create these
hundreds of syndromes,

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.350 align:middle line:84%

bit more than 100 people

around the world.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And it will help us to rise
over anything challenging

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:90%
that may be ahead of us.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:24:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we awaken
this within ourselves?

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Well, the awakening
starts with memories.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And then really realizing,
well, I'm different.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We all have this story, I'm
the black sheep of the family

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.260 align:middle line:90%
and nobody understands me.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And we all think
this is such a curse.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But once you turn
it around, and you

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:84%
stop identifying yourself as a
different, you make a choice.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:90%
You say, you know what?

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm a good heart
centered person.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:25.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean well.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to choose to
feel good about my different.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly hold
the new reality opens

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:90%
and that's how you awaken it.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Then you start reading
the different books,

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:44.420 align:middle line:84%
watch the Gaia shows and says,
well that speaks to me why I

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.350 align:middle line:84%
cannot be like that person,
why I can have those memories.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And that literally leads us
on the way of the learning

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and exploring and
finding who we are.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you an
extraterrestrial?

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.198 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: I am a star seed.

00:24:59.198 --> 00:25:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we
all are, aren't we?

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But, I mean, are you
more a star seed than most?

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: That's hard to say.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I do have a memory of a life in
Pleiades and on other planets.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And if that memory makes
me more extraterrestrial

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.130 align:middle line:84%
than the human, then may
be in my consciousness.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But in the body, I'm
human as anybody else.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you learn all this?

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: So I
work with my guides.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.740 align:middle line:90%
A lot of my memories--

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In dream state?

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: In the dream
state, in the meditation,

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
in reading different
kind of the books.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But most of it came in the
dream state of meditation.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you understand it
right away or did it take time?

00:25:43.337 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: It took a time.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.390 align:middle line:84%
It took a long time
until I understood it,

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.520 align:middle line:84%
until I embrace it,
and until I start

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.040 align:middle line:90%
believing that this is true.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is true that makes
my life better and the people

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that I work with, it
makes their life better.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us an
example, if you can,

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.190 align:middle line:90%
on just how this works?

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: So let's say empathy.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Empathy is that extraterrestrial
ability or the cosmic DNA

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:90%
ability that we have.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.920 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have such a
hard time with empathy today.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And they try to shield
themselves and close it

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:84%
that they will never feel
anything that there is.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, the empathy, if I
start looking in another way

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:84%
can be the biggest
gift in our life.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:84%
When as an empathetic
person, let's say

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.080 align:middle line:84%
a doctor or the nurse,
they'll train themself

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.570 align:middle line:84%
for this empathy, they can
actually through this empathy,

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:42.280 align:middle line:84%
scan the body of
the patient and can

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
find what is the
problem within the body

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.190 align:middle line:84%
instead of just going
according to assigned questions

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.910 align:middle line:90%
as we are taught at school.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, the
empathy can save the life.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being
something like, oh, God.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
to my parents' dinner

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.550 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to feel
all the negativity around.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's a
choice to learn to stop

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.740 align:middle line:84%
judging what we are feeling
and finding ourselves

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
in a place and a situation
that we would like to be.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.740 align:middle line:90%
So that's the one example.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
languages of light?

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Language of light is
the language of this universe.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So we know that this
universe is intelligent mind.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, it must have
an intelligent language

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.600 align:middle line:84%
that everybody in this
universe will communicate

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:84%
despite our differences,
our different languages

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.340 align:middle line:90%
or where we are living.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Now commonly people are--

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.150 align:middle line:84%
people find a language of
light of the spoken form

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:90%
that many of us do today.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:84%
But there are many other aspects
of the language of light,

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:84%
as colors, sound,
numbers, geometric shapes.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And all part of the senses to
smell, taste, touch, sight.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Now despite wherever
we live in the world,

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
despite whatever
language we speak,

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:12.060 align:middle line:84%
the red color will
always be red.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And I do have this belief that
the red colors will always be

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.120 align:middle line:90%
red anywhere in this universe.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.210 align:middle line:84%
That itself is the language
and communicate to ourselves.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.960 align:middle line:84%
All the crop circles are
made in the geometric shapes

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:84%
because the geometric
shapes can be

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:31.350 align:middle line:84%
understood from the point of
the mathematical language.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And the mathematical language
can be expressed in the sound,

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.190 align:middle line:90%
in the music, in the colors.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.195 align:middle line:84%
And from that we can make a
story that somebody can tell.

00:28:42.195 --> 00:28:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you teach
people this or how

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.230 align:middle line:90%
can other people learn this?

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes, I do to
teach classes about this.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.553 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
does it take to learn?

00:28:50.553 --> 00:28:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Well, it depends.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Some people remember
and it goes really fast

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and some people really need
to find that niche or that

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:90%
what they feel drawn to.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's very hard to
teach somebody just

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.440 align:middle line:84%
to speak the language of light
because there's not really

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.670 align:middle line:90%
a dictionary for it.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:84%
But you can learn
it by taking let's

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.080 align:middle line:84%
say the seven colors
of the rainbow,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.900 align:middle line:84%
putting the pencil beside
you, and just the feeling

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.820 align:middle line:84%
your emotions, your
energy, and reach

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.270 align:middle line:84%
for that color, which you
want you want to express

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.950 align:middle line:90%
your emotion at the moment.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.440 align:middle line:90%
That is the language of life.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:90%
of the humanity.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do not know.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: I think that is huge.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The 20% that do
know how do they find out?

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: They had that memory,
something happened to them.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Whenever it was an illness
or trauma or tragic,

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:84%
something that happened, that
would awaken them into this,

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:17.213 align:middle line:84%
there is something
different about me

00:32:17.213 --> 00:32:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
start feeling it.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.860 align:middle line:84%
They're either going
to be depressed

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.950 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of my life or
I'm going to find my way

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and that way lead
you into the DNA.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.840 align:middle line:84%
However, they are on this
fast growing track right now.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think that this 20%
have a great potential

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.160 align:middle line:90%
to awaken to rest of--

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us an
example, if you can,

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.020 align:middle line:84%
about the communication
and demonstration

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.565 align:middle line:90%
of light language.

00:32:42.565 --> 00:32:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: All right.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Mine is the spoken form.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And mine comes from the heart
and this is how it goes.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.785 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:32:50.785 --> 00:33:05.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.284 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What language was that?

00:33:07.284 --> 00:33:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: That, I think was the
Pleiadian form, well, I think.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I know that was the Pleiadian
form of the language of light.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.467 align:middle line:90%
It's the soul healing form.

00:33:15.467 --> 00:33:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did it mean?

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.242 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: What it means?

00:33:18.242 --> 00:33:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It means that I share my love
from my heart with everybody

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.550 align:middle line:90%
who's listening today.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So the last light language
of light can reach to them

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and can reach to that
sleeping DNA within and says,

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.580 align:middle line:90%
you are loved.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.830 align:middle line:90%
You are loved by the universe.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the purpose,
do you think, of light language?

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:39.258 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have it?

00:33:39.258 --> 00:33:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: We know
these extraterrestrials,

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:42.880 align:middle line:84%
they want to
communicate with us.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And they may know really
well to speak English.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And we want to become
multidimensional species

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.080 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And as we are on this journey
to exploring eventually

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.520 align:middle line:84%
the other planet, they may come
across these extraterrestrials.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And instead of just
be afraid of them,

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.630 align:middle line:90%
we will know how to communicate.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:90%
That is the one reason.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.880 align:middle line:84%
The second reason would be that
it quickened our awakening.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And it quickens
also the development

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.350 align:middle line:90%
of that sleeping DNA within us.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
multi-dimensional, Eva?

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.949 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes, we are.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:16.030 align:middle line:90%
We definitely are.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:17.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
good thing, isn't it?

00:34:17.655 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: I think
it's a great thing.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.540 align:middle line:84%
We are multidimensional
because in our meditations

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.360 align:middle line:84%
we can reach these
multi-dimensional places.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:84%
That means if as
far as we can reach,

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.550 align:middle line:84%
so deep we can go
within our body.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And we say, well, this
is just the body, right?

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.360 align:middle line:84%
But if we look just
our seven chakras,

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.000 align:middle line:84%
there will be seven
dimensions right there.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.920 align:middle line:84%
We are reaching the third
to the fifth dimension.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:47.409 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at our sensory
system, as the smell, taste,

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:52.420 align:middle line:84%
sight, touch, and sound,
here we have our sixth sense,

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.360 align:middle line:90%
and the time traveling sense.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Those are our 7 dimensions
within the body.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And those 7 dimensions can be
connected with out of the body

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.800 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.240 align:middle line:90%
That's just the beginning.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we the
extraterrestrials?

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Some of us are.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:11.720 align:middle line:90%
We are the ancient aliens.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.650 align:middle line:84%
If we can trace our life
back to the ancient Atlantis

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:19.310 align:middle line:84%
or to Lemuria, if we
can trace our past lives

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.280 align:middle line:84%
before the biblical
flood, that mean

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that they must have we're in the
extraterrestrial body that may

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:90%
have been genetically modified.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How has
this changed you?

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: It gave me the
great appreciation for life,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude for being here
and understanding myself

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.880 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have
to fear death.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
fear of who we are.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's just so
much of awesomeness

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:90%
about every single one of us.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody at home
watching this program right

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:59.900 align:middle line:84%
now is probably saying,
I have alien DNA in me.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.080 align:middle line:90%
How do they know this?

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.480 align:middle line:84%
How can they find
out on their own?

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Well, if they are
drawn to any ancient sites

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.250 align:middle line:84%
or watching the shows like this,
there is something within them,

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.755 align:middle line:84%
within that DNA that
says, hey, pay attention.

00:36:17.755 --> 00:36:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It turns
it on for them.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: It turns it on.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
step, make it normal.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they're
going to wake up in the bed

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.010 align:middle line:84%
with green skin
and big black eyes.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.770 align:middle line:84%
We're still going to
be humans in this body.

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to take
that knowledge

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and apply it to the 21st
century and make it normal.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Make it to be part
of our evolution

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and the human race that's going
to make this world a better

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:90%
place for the long term.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do our cosmic
ancestors want from us?

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: They
want us to remember.

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:54.380 align:middle line:84%
They want us to remember that
we are them and they are us.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And that their greatest
joy and a journey

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.990 align:middle line:84%
is to help us to
awaken and to evolve.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:06.110 align:middle line:84%
See, if we look
at the beginning,

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:09.260 align:middle line:84%
let's say the human race and
the genetic modification,

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.960 align:middle line:84%
they still were
allowed to evolve.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.080 align:middle line:84%
They did not stay
as a control species

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:19.850 align:middle line:84%
or are somebody who will stay in
that part of the evolution that

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:21.380 align:middle line:90%
was allowed to them.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.750 align:middle line:84%
They were put into
that evolving process

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.360 align:middle line:84%
to become
multidimensional spaces.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So they want us to know
that that's who we are.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.500 align:middle line:84%
They want us to win that
last fight within us.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.710 align:middle line:84%
They want us to let go
of the fears and the hate

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and the judgment of each other
and find love and happiness

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and make the Earth the
most beautiful place

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:44.300 align:middle line:90%
for our generations to come.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.653 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has this made
you a better person?

00:37:46.653 --> 00:37:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Absolutely.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In which ways?

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: In all ways.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I was born into the
human with eager DNA.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.930 align:middle line:84%
My idea about the
life in the 20s

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.420 align:middle line:84%
was totally different
than it is today.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Helping the people
to find who they are,

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:05.070 align:middle line:84%
helping them to
understand or be different

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.430 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest
things in the world.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Brings me such joy and happiness
and the hope for the future.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was Jesus a star seed?

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:14.328 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Oh, yes.

00:38:14.328 --> 00:38:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to know
which one, right?

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.372 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably much
more than we thought, huh?

00:38:18.372 --> 00:38:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: I believe
so and I think

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that him and Mary
Magdalene scenes

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:26.430 align:middle line:84%
were literally showing us look
we were born as the humans

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.980 align:middle line:84%
because I think we all can
understand that they were not

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.290 align:middle line:84%
dropped off here
from the spaceship.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And we work our way.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:middle line:84%
There's no magical
transformation

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.570 align:middle line:90%
in the Jesus Christ.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can-- for most of
the part, trade his trade

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:45.150 align:middle line:84%
his journey of learning
and practicing and evolving

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.650 align:middle line:90%
until he released to death.

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And as a true teacher
was teaching to those

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.510 align:middle line:90%
who are willing to listen.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
been to the Pleiades?

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: In my
meditation, yes.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's it like?

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: It's beautiful.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:01.500 align:middle line:84%
The energy up there is beyond
our human comprehension.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:08.190 align:middle line:84%
The level of the laugh and
the happiness and serenity

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:90%
is just beautiful.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad
this has happened to you?

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No regrets?

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: No.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy that I can
understand myself.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy that I don't have
to be this depressed human who

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:27.900 align:middle line:84%
was always thinking that the
things are happening to me

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.320 align:middle line:84%
because we all are, many
of us are like that.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And finding this
way of the change.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they
want from us, Eva?

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.010 align:middle line:84%
What do the ancestors
want from us?

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Anything?

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: They want us
to be peaceful nation.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:84%
They want us when
we one day joined

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:53.200 align:middle line:84%
us beautiful community of
extraterrestrial beings,

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.930 align:middle line:84%
to be peaceful,
to be benevolent.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:58.270 align:middle line:90%
To let go of our control.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And they literally
want us that we learn.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.170 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
really come here

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, let
me teach you ABC.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.920 align:middle line:84%
They says, they'll
give it to you.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.780 align:middle line:90%
And you learn it by yourself.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.870 align:middle line:84%
They give you the curriculum
and you master it.

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:12.760 align:middle line:90%
They want us to be healthy.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.330 align:middle line:90%
They want us to be happy.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.300 align:middle line:84%
They want us to create
families that are

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.610 align:middle line:90%
inspiring to anybody out there.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
pretty good way to look

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.140 align:middle line:90%
at it what they want from us.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
multidimensional awareness

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:26.170 align:middle line:90%
anyway?

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: Ooh,
multidimensional awareness

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.140 align:middle line:84%
is the activation
of your sixth sense.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Now our sixth sense can
literally activate only

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.180 align:middle line:84%
when we start
understanding our five

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.750 align:middle line:84%
basic senses, and our
chakras, and energy within us.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:43.420 align:middle line:84%
When it's aligned
some like Kundalini

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:84%
energy when it rises all the way
up, then that awareness open.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.340 align:middle line:84%
The multidimensional
awareness is literally

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and simple way explain
understanding of our body.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:58.870 align:middle line:90%
So I can tune in my body.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.230 align:middle line:90%
And I can say OK.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Is it OK to eat the gluten
or the dairy or the vegetable

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:03.860 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stay healthy.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.385 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: That is
multidimensional awareness

00:41:06.385 --> 00:41:09.490 align:middle line:84%
within our body and then
other, like me traveling

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:14.140 align:middle line:84%
to Pleiades, that is because of
my multidimensional awareness.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our friend
Matias De Stefano

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:21.136 align:middle line:84%
talked about tapping into
the multi-dimensional beings.

00:41:21.136 --> 00:41:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So what
you started to do

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.950 align:middle line:84%
was to hear the voices of our
guides in other dimensions.

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:30.070 align:middle line:10%
You would start to
listen the voices

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:34.070 align:middle line:10%
and the vibration of the high
masters in the fifth dimension.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.020 align:middle line:84%
You would start feel how
the Elohim are creating us

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:42.850 align:middle line:84%
You will start to feel the
power of the archangels

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:46.090 align:middle line:84%
in the seventh dimension
holding you in this reality.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you match that all
in every one of your chakras,

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:55.660 align:middle line:84%
you become the
messenger of every beam

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.960 align:middle line:84%
that was forming you and
shaping you in every dimension.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And that made that those
priests and priestess

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:84%
would be able to become
gods and goddesses.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So what we used to separate
in different levels

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:16.470 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness like humans,
Aessir, the Confederation,

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:23.670 align:middle line:84%
the guides, the angels, the High
Masters, the Ascended Masters,

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:28.650 align:middle line:84%
the archangels, they
are all the same being

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:33.180 align:middle line:84%
in different vibrations
holding one reality.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.720 align:middle line:10%
So when you become
those realities

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.970 align:middle line:10%
through the portals
of your own body,

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:10%
you are able to speak for them.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.610 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we
call channeling.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.760 align:middle line:10%
Channeling was to
download the information

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.810 align:middle line:10%
from other levels like the
wire, the Wi-Fi of the universe,

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:55.110 align:middle line:10%
and download those
patterns into the body

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:58.380 align:middle line:10%
when you had the
proper information that

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:03.630 align:middle line:10%
matches the structure
of vibration and pattern

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:07.240 align:middle line:10%
of geometry from those
levels of consciousness.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.800 align:middle line:10%
So that's what allowed the
priests and priestesses

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.470 align:middle line:10%
to download this information.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:17.850 align:middle line:84%
By this matching they would
bring that information

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:19.590 align:middle line:90%
into the matter.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what do
you think of that?

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: That is amazing.

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See what I teach
the people is to understand

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.190 align:middle line:90%
the centers within our body.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So Matias DiStefano shows
you how to get it up there.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to come
and into the body.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But when people
get into the body,

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:40.570 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand
it as well.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So what we received from
that multidimensional, when

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:48.677 align:middle line:84%
we receive in the body, body has
a little confusion sometimes.

00:43:48.677 --> 00:43:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we start
feeling different, right?

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.540 align:middle line:90%
It's like, is it true?

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Is it happening?

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Is it not happening?

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadeans
when you asked me

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:56.860 align:middle line:90%
before what they want from us?

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.750 align:middle line:84%
They want us to understand
how to take that information

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and how to understand
it within you.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.690 align:middle line:84%
How to perceive it
as a full download

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:09.000 align:middle line:90%
and what to do with it.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With empathy?

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.560 align:middle line:84%
With empathy, with
other abilities,

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.560 align:middle line:84%
like if I can hear
the other beings

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.580 align:middle line:84%
in the multidimensional places,
then sound and the hearing

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.440 align:middle line:90%
is the fifth chakra.

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Fifth chakra has
special abilities,

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.160 align:middle line:84%
which I call sometimes
the energy power centers.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's like this energy
power center that at a moment

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:34.210 align:middle line:90%
will receive that.

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So when I receive
those messages,

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.990 align:middle line:84%
I may not receive them
necessarily in my third chakra

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.360 align:middle line:84%
because if I receive
them as an empathy,

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.330 align:middle line:84%
it will be kind of the
feeling, like how it

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:46.740 align:middle line:90%
feels what they are telling me.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But if I receive it as a
sound, as a sentence I receive,

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I receive it through my hearing
and the sound abilities.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad
this has happened to you?

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Yes.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.822 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No regrets?

00:44:58.822 --> 00:45:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: I have no regrets.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:08.410 align:middle line:10%
No, no because this makes life
more enjoyable and helping

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:11.230 align:middle line:10%
the others is a great
way to live a life.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you?

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.902 align:middle line:10%
>>MARQUEZ: So I have applied
My website is evamarquez.org.

00:45:17.902 --> 00:45:19.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And the
name of your book?

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.777 align:middle line:10%
>>MARQUEZ: And the
name of my book

00:45:20.777 --> 00:45:22.640 align:middle line:10%
is "Activate Your Cosmic DNA."

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.210 align:middle line:10%
Yes, spell your website.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARQUEZ: My website
is E-V-A M-A-R-Q-U-E-Z .

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.070 align:middle line:90%
O-R-G.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very good.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARQUEZ: Thank you so much.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.120 align:middle line:10%
It is, I will admit,
a strange feeling

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:42.160 align:middle line:10%
knowing that you have alien
DNA within your system.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.460 align:middle line:10%
But maybe that's what's
made us who we are today.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:49.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."
