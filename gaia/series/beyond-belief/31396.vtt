welcome to  Beyond Belief .

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.213 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger one of my
boyhood idols was Rod Serling,

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.081 align:middle line:84%
the creator of  The
Twilight Zone .

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:52.986 align:middle line:84%
I loved those episodes; I was
obsessed with the things he did.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.289 align:middle line:84%
Little did I know that later
on in life I would get a chance

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.794 align:middle line:84%
and an opportunity to know his
wife Carol, his daughter Anne,

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:03.029 align:middle line:84%
and our next guest
on  Beyond Belief .

>> Marc Zicree: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.725 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.059 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
it worked out great.

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.194 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: We did the
DVDs and the Blu-Rays, and you

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.295 align:middle line:84%
and I got to do audio
commentaries on the --

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:36.263 align:middle line:84%
on our favorite  Twilight
Zone  episodes.

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:37.196 align:middle line:90%

>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.033 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How did you
get interested, first of all,

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:40.734 align:middle line:90%
in  The Twilight Zone ?

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:42.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Sure.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.638 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know when I was a kid
I -- it was on past my bedtime,

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and then one day my stepfather
was tinkering in the garage,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.175 align:middle line:84%
and there was an
old TV set there.

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.377 align:middle line:84%
And he actually had one
TV that just got sound,

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:51.945 align:middle line:84%
and one TV that just got
picture, and they were

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.313 align:middle line:84%
on [laughter] different
channels,

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.782 align:middle line:84%
and on the picture one there
was this flying saucer landing

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.851 align:middle line:84%
and this weird thing with
these -- these astronauts.

00:01:57.851 --> 00:01:59.553 align:middle line:84%
It was an episode
called "Death Ship,"

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.288 align:middle line:84%
and it was the first episode
of  Twilight Zone  I ever saw,

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.956 align:middle line:90%
one of the hour-long episodes.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.524 align:middle line:90%
And -- and I was hooked.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:05.892 align:middle line:90%
I was hooked.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:08.094 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I got out of
college I decided I was going

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.063 align:middle line:84%
to write a book about  The
Twilight Zone  and learn how --

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:11.765 align:middle line:84%
how Rod made all
that magic happen.

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.867 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I will
always remember Serling coming

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.602 align:middle line:90%
out talking about things right

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.537 align:middle line:84%
after a little vignette
of the...

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:18.939 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.674 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...episode, and
then he'd go to a commercial.

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:21.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And just
everything from the music,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.179 align:middle line:84%
to his style, to the
things that he did...

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.615 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...were just
unduplicatable [phonetic].

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.016 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: No,
he was one of a kind.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because on
TV before Rod generally the --

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.188 align:middle line:84%
generally the producers
ran the show,

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:84%
and the writers were
subordinate to them.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.326 align:middle line:84%
But Rod really was the first
writer to say, "This is my show.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.694 align:middle line:90%
This is my stamp on it.

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:43.463 align:middle line:84%
This is me presenting my
show to you, the audience."

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:46.566 align:middle line:84%
And now writers run television;
writers run dramas and comedies.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.367 align:middle line:84%
And that led to J.J.
Abram, and Joss Whedon,

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and all these amazing people
who are running shows now.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.038 align:middle line:84%
And Rod really set
the template for that.

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:53.406 align:middle line:84%
He was -- he was
quite something.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.508 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Did he
even think he would be

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:58.111 align:middle line:84%
as successful as
he ended up being?

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, the funny
thing was the last interview he

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.651 align:middle line:84%
gave before he died, sadly at
the age of 50, someone asked him

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:05.885 align:middle line:90%
if he thought that his --

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.587 align:middle line:84%
if he thought his work would
stand the test of time,

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.756 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "Good
writing, like good wine,

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:10.957 align:middle line:84%
has to age well with
time [laughter].

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And my work has been
momentarily adequate."

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.494 align:middle line:90%
And so he didn't know that --

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.229 align:middle line:84%
that 50 years later his
work would be the classic it

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.264 align:middle line:90%
has become.

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:19.332 align:middle line:84%
So -- but he just
did an amazing job.

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.867 align:middle line:84%
He was -- and he
dictated his scripts;

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:21.968 align:middle line:90%
that was the amazing thing.

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:23.069 align:middle line:84%
He would -- he would
wake in the morning...

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.903 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: With
a little Dictaphone?

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:24.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: That's right.

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:25.739 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:26.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: He would
wake up in the morning,

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.341 align:middle line:84%
go into his backyard,
lounge by his swimming pool,

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and dictate  The Twilight Zone
scripts into a Dictaphone,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.278 align:middle line:84%
or later a cassette
recorder, and --

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and then his secretary
would type them up,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.615 align:middle line:84%
and he'd make little
hand corrections.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:36.883 align:middle line:84%
So he used to joke that
he was the only writer

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.785 align:middle line:84%
who could write a script
while getting a tan.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:39.753 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's amazing.

00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: So,
yeah [laughter].

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.821 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
That is amazing.

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:42.855 align:middle line:84%
And he would play the
characters and everything.

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: He
would; he would.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.991 align:middle line:84%
He would basically
-- he would --

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:46.793 align:middle line:84%
what Rod always said that
he was -- he was a ham.

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.094 align:middle line:90%
You know a ham actor.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.597 align:middle line:84%
And so he really loved to
-- to go into the characters

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:51.965 align:middle line:90%
and be the characters.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.867 align:middle line:84%
And -- and some of  The
Twilight Zone  episodes the --

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:56.102 align:middle line:84%
it almost sounds like two Rod
Serlings talking to each other,

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:58.138 align:middle line:84%
and that's because he
was very good with --

00:03:58.138 --> 00:03:59.072 align:middle line:90%
with dictating dialogue.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.507 align:middle line:84%
He was -- he was
quite phenomenal.

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:03.777 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: He tried to
leak in his social commentary...

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:05.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:06.579 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...in a
very subtle way, didn't he?

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah, he did.

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:09.482 align:middle line:84%
And -- well, he was a -- he
was -- he was very much --

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:10.817 align:middle line:84%
he was a liberal;
he was a humanist.

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:12.485 align:middle line:84%
He really had -- was
rooting for the little guy,

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:14.387 align:middle line:84%
and you can really
see that in his work,

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:15.989 align:middle line:90%
that he has a great sympathy

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.091 align:middle line:84%
for you know just --
just average folks.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.292 align:middle line:90%
You know most of the people

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:21.093 align:middle line:84%
on  The Twilight Zone
aren't presidents, or --

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
or heads of state, or you
know -- or generals, or --

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.465 align:middle line:90%
or anyone in -- in huge power.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:84%
They're usually the little guys,
bank tellers, salespersons...

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.501 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Right, troubled people.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:29.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, yes.

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:31.104 align:middle line:84%
Women -- like "The
Hitchhiker" with Inger Stevens

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.505 align:middle line:84%
where she's driving
cross country, and she...

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.474 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: ...keeps seeing

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:35.608 align:middle line:84%
that malevolent hitchhiker
wherever she goes.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.444 align:middle line:84%
He had the sympathy for
-- for the little guy.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.112 align:middle line:84%
And he -- and he
had a sense of that

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.181 align:middle line:84%
if we all ban together we
can create a better life.

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:43.583 align:middle line:84%
And  Twilight Zone  was very
much about moral choices

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:46.286 align:middle line:84%
and people rising to
their best selves.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.455 align:middle line:84%
And -- and so there was
-- there's a great heart.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.857 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why, even
when you've seen an episode,

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.492 align:middle line:84%
and you know what
the twist ending is,

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:54.494 align:middle line:84%
you can watch it again, and
again, and again because there's

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:57.163 align:middle line:84%
such humanity in the
writing, whether it's Rod

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:58.431 align:middle line:84%
or the other writers
who worked on the show.

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Rod wrote -- there
were 156 episodes;

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.268 align:middle line:90%
he wrote 92 of them himself.

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: That's
-- that's extensive.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.004 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: It's amazing.

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:06.573 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Now where
did he find the other writers?

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:08.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, this is
a story -- you know it's funny.

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:10.677 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote  The Twilight Zone
Companion  there was someone I

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.446 align:middle line:84%
wanted to interview, and he
declined to be interviewed.

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:15.781 align:middle line:84%
He -- he was very gracious about
it, but was Ray Bradbury, our --

00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:16.783 align:middle line:90%
our dear friend Ray Bradbury.

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:17.817 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
God rest his soul.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Sadly missed.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.788 align:middle line:84%
And -- but in -- in the last
15 years Ray became a very good

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:23.256 align:middle line:90%
friend of mine.

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:24.557 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, "Okay, talk to
me about  Twilight Zone , Ray,"

00:05:24.557 --> 00:05:25.692 align:middle line:84%
because he and --
he and Rod had --

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:27.093 align:middle line:84%
had had a little bit
of a falling out.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:30.263 align:middle line:84%
But he told me that when
Twilight Zone  was green lit,

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:32.565 align:middle line:84%
when Rod sold the show,
he called Ray Bradbury,

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:35.001 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "I don't know
anything about science fiction.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Help me." And so
Ray said, "Well,

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.071 align:middle line:90%
come on over to the house."

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.539 align:middle line:84%
And -- and he took --
he took Rod Serling

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.840 align:middle line:90%
down into his basement --

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.308 align:middle line:84%
Ray Bradbury at that point
was already the top science

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:43.009 align:middle line:90%
fiction writer.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:43.977 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:45.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
he said, "Okay."

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:46.413 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled some
books from his shelf.

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:47.647 align:middle line:84%
One was by John Collier, who
was a very famous short story

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:48.781 align:middle line:90%
writer, British.

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.151 align:middle line:84%
One was by George -- one
was by Charles Beaumont;

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:52.719 align:middle line:90%
one was by Richard Matheson.

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:53.753 align:middle line:90%
They were two of his proteges.

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:55.588 align:middle line:84%
And one was a book
by Ray himself.

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:57.791 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Read these,
and then let's talk."

00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:00.593 align:middle line:84%
And so Serling ended up adapting
one of John Collier's stories --

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:02.262 align:middle line:84%
stories for  Twilight
Zone  , but he brought --

00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:03.997 align:middle line:84%
he brought Beaumont
and Matheson aboard

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:05.932 align:middle line:84%
as his main writers
beyond himself,

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:08.468 align:middle line:84%
and they wrote amazing episodes
like "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:09.335 align:middle line:90%
with the gremlin on the wing.

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
I love that one.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.004 align:middle line:90%
That was with Shatner, right?

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:11.571 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes, Shatner.

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.505 align:middle line:90%
Great episode.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:13.907 align:middle line:84%
And -- and so that
became his core.

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:15.809 align:middle line:84%
So -- so Ray Bradbury
was very instrumental

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:84%
in shaping what  Twilight
Zone  became.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.578 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Super.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:20.046 align:middle line:84%
We've got some vignettes
that I want to --

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.848 align:middle line:84%
to show to our  Beyond
Belief  audience.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:23.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Great.

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:23.783 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Now the first
is "Nothing in the Dark."

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:24.451 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a...

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:25.518 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:26.219 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...little bit about that.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Well,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.455 align:middle line:84%
George Clayton Johnson
was the other great writer

00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:29.656 align:middle line:84%
of  The Twilight
Zone , and "Nothing

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:31.057 align:middle line:84%
in the Dark" stars Gladys
Cooper as an old woman

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.326 align:middle line:84%
who has barricaded herself in
her apartment because she's sure

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.228 align:middle line:84%
that death will come
in some disguise...

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.229 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Ah.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.197 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...and
take her away.

00:06:37.197 --> 00:06:38.598 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And -- and get her.

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:39.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And then one day
she hears gunfire outside her

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.801 align:middle line:84%
apartment, and a
policeman has been shot,

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and he's begging
her to help him.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.872 align:middle line:84%
And -- and her compassion
overcomes her fear,

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and she brings him
into her apartment.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.543 align:middle line:84%
And it's this amazing piece --
George Clayton Johnson was --

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.445 align:middle line:84%
was barely 30 when
he wrote that script,

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.781 align:middle line:84%
but it's this real rumination
on old age, and death,

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:57.217 align:middle line:84%
and fear of death, and
moving on, and being part

00:06:57.217 --> 00:06:58.551 align:middle line:90%
of the larger universe.

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:01.955 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing piece of
writing, and to play the --

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:03.656 align:middle line:84%
the cop they -- they
got a young actor

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:05.725 align:middle line:84%
who hadn't done very much
-- at that point he hadn't.

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:08.194 align:middle line:84%
He was -- he wasn't really well
known, but it's Robert Redford.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:09.329 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Ah!

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:10.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And it's
just an amazing cast.

00:07:10.697 --> 00:07:11.531 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: He jump-started
so many careers, didn't he?

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:12.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Indeed, indeed.

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:13.333 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's cool.

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:14.634 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a little
look at this.

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:21.406 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music]
It's time to rest.

00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:25.011 align:middle line:90%
Give me your hand.

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.447 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't want to die.

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:35.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Trust me.

00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:35.922 align:middle line:90%
>> No [crying].

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:36.856 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:42.161 align:middle line:90%
>> Mother, give me your hand.

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.401 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
He was a genius.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:49.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: That's
such a great, good scene.

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:50.537 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
He took death...

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:51.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:53.473 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...and made
it to this little, old lady...

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Right.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.575 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...sound, "Well,

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:57.076 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's not all that bad."

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:07:59.812 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And he took
a -- a good-looking guy,

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:03.483 align:middle line:84%
Robert Redford, and just made
it very comfortable for her.

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes, well I
mean, it's -- it's interesting.

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:08.187 align:middle line:84%
It's rare that you have
work that is profound.

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And  Twilight Zone  again,
and again, and again comes

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.091 align:middle line:84%
to a profound truth
about all our lives.

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.893 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing even
in that scene where --

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:16.362 align:middle line:84%
first of all, it's gorgeously
lit, gorgeously performed.

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:17.697 align:middle line:90%
The -- the directing is great;

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:19.465 align:middle line:84%
the writing is great;
the acting is superb.

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Something
about black-and-white...

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:22.769 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: ...film, truly.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And -- and I
asked George Clayton Johnson

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:25.104 align:middle line:84%
when -- when I was talking
to him about this episode,

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:25.939 align:middle line:84%
you know Robert Redford
calls her mother,

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:27.073 align:middle line:90%
and he's -- he's not her son.

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:29.642 align:middle line:90%
He's death personified, but --

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:33.146 align:middle line:84%
but George's idea was he's
speaking to her as a mother...

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...as --
you know so there's --

00:08:35.647 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:84%
he's speaking to her as her
role in life, as her humanity.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's just this great
wisdom in the writing, and --

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.421 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it's
stood the test of time.

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:44.457 align:middle line:84%
You know, great work
stands the test of time.

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:45.658 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Unlike
A Christmas Carol

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
where death shows up with
that black hood and...

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:49.829 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...you know
you don't see his face...

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:51.965 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...and this
bony little hand, and stuff...

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:52.799 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:53.766 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: ...like that.

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:55.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
-- and George --

00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:56.569 align:middle line:84%
George told me that the whole
point was that death is not a --

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:59.439 align:middle line:84%
isn't something to be feared;
it's something to be embraced.

00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:02.308 align:middle line:84%
And -- and George
now is in his 80s,

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:03.676 align:middle line:84%
and so it's very
interesting to see --

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:04.811 align:middle line:84%
to talk to him about
these episodes.

00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:06.179 align:middle line:84%
When we did the audio
commentaries

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:09.282 align:middle line:84%
for the Blu-Ray I got to talk
to George Clayton Johnson

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:11.284 align:middle line:84%
about all the episodes
he wrote, and it's funny.

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.486 align:middle line:84%
Now what he says is when -- when
he himself sees death coming

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:14.721 align:middle line:84%
for him he's going to
side step him [laughter],

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.222 align:middle line:90%
so that's his plan.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.657 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Was there a message

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
in every  Twilight
Zone  episode?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes, in
most of them I think,

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:23.263 align:middle line:90%
or perhaps in all of them.

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:25.264 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically --
and as a writer...

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:25.965 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
mean, he know it was...

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:26.899 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:27.567 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...entertainment.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.268 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:29.636 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right?

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:30.336 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: He did, and
that's the first obligation...

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:31.304 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:32.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...of
any writer.

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.273 align:middle line:90%
You have to entertain someone.

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:34.374 align:middle line:84%
If you're -- if you're
lecturing them and --

00:09:34.374 --> 00:09:35.008 align:middle line:84%
and being tedious you're
-- what's the point?

00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:36.175 align:middle line:90%
You're going to...

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:36.943 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
lose your audience, yeah.

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:38.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Of course.

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:39.345 align:middle line:84%
But -- but what Rod taught me
as a writer is you have to look

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:40.046 align:middle line:84%
in -- well, Ray Bradbury
said this, too;

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:41.147 align:middle line:90%
he said, "Look inside.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.282 align:middle line:84%
Rather than looking
outside, look inside.

00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:43.816 align:middle line:84%
Find your heart; find
what you truly believe;

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.385 align:middle line:90%
find what you truly care about.

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:46.519 align:middle line:90%
Write from that."

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.154 align:middle line:84%
And Rod -- Rod actually
used to talk about this.

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:50.823 align:middle line:84%
Rod Serling was talking to a --
to a class, and he was saying,

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:53.459 align:middle line:84%
"Whenever I write I --
I ask myself, is this --

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.528 align:middle line:90%
is this the truth as I know it?

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:57.363 align:middle line:90%
Or better yet, as I feel it?"

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:58.698 align:middle line:90%
And that was what guided him.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:00.667 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: The next
clip is also a great message,

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorites, which
has helped steer me in  Coast

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.739 align:middle line:90%
to Coast , is "To Serve Man."

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.075 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Tell me
the theme behind this one.

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.309 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well,
"To Serve Man" is based

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:11.844 align:middle line:84%
on a very famous science
fiction short story written

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:13.012 align:middle line:90%
by Damon Knight who was one

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:14.847 align:middle line:84%
of my writing teachers,
interestingly enough.

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:17.517 align:middle line:84%
And Damon told me that he
wrote that story one night

00:10:17.517 --> 00:10:19.819 align:middle line:84%
when his wife was out with
another man, and so he was

00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:21.454 align:middle line:84%
in a very [laughter]
dark -- very dark...

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.155 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:23.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: ...mood.

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:23.923 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
I would think so.

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:25.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Very dark mood,

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.025 align:middle line:84%
and so Rod of course read
the story and adapted it

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:90%
to a  Twilight Zone  episode,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.895 align:middle line:84%
and it's a great  Twilight Zone
episode about aliens coming

00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:31.864 align:middle line:84%
to Earth who supposedly are very
benevolent, and they just want

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:90%
to supposedly to serve man.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.969 align:middle line:84%
And -- and it's fascinating
because in that episode --

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:39.205 align:middle line:84%
I recently was talking with
Richard Bare who directed it;

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:41.174 align:middle line:84%
he's going to be 100 in
August, this -- this director.

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:41.841 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Wow!

00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:43.042 align:middle line:90%
Still going strong?

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:43.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Still
going strong, amazing man.

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:44.711 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:46.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
it's fascinating

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.146 align:middle line:84%
because this episode is unlike
Twilight Zone  episodes

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.481 align:middle line:84%
in general because
it has a character

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.817 align:middle line:84%
who actually talks directly
to the camera, not just Rod.

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.386 align:middle line:84%
And -- and the aliens were
all played by one actor,

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:54.654 align:middle line:90%
Richard Kiel, who was

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.589 align:middle line:84%
around seven feet
tall, seven foot, two.

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:59.192 align:middle line:84%
He later played the character
Jaws in the James Bond movies.

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:01.761 align:middle line:84%
But -- but it was a fascinating
thing because he looks --

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:04.964 align:middle line:84%
he looks a little bit angelic,
and a little bit devilish.

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:05.998 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: A
little bit corrupt,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.302 align:middle line:84%
and it's a great make-up, and
-- and just a terrific episode.

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's
take a look at this one.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:19.645 align:middle line:84%
>> [Radio static] This
is flight number 914

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:25.051 align:middle line:90%
from earth to our planet.

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:84%
We will be taking
off in three minutes.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Mr. Chambers!

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:30.923 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Chambers!

00:11:30.923 --> 00:11:34.227 align:middle line:90%
Don't get on that ship!

00:11:34.227 --> 00:11:40.266 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the book,
To Serve Men , it's --

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:41.868 align:middle line:84%
it's a cookbook [Background
Music]!

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.736 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Oh [laughter],
dinner is served, Marc.

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:44.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes,
that's so great [laughter].

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:46.339 align:middle line:90%
That's so great.

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:47.507 align:middle line:84%
And of course that -- that's one
of the great snappers at the end

00:11:47.507 --> 00:11:48.775 align:middle line:84%
of these  Twilight
Zone  episodes.

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:49.742 align:middle line:90%
But you know one thing was --

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.077 align:middle line:84%
that's really great
when you watch

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:53.045 align:middle line:84%
that little clip is  Twilight
Zone  was shot at MGM,

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:56.249 align:middle line:84%
and that was the greatest
studio ever, and they --

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:58.918 align:middle line:84%
and Rod had access to all
the props, all the costumes,

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:01.387 align:middle line:84%
all the sets ever
built for any MGM...

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:02.255 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Any episode?

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:03.656 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...movie
-- yeah.

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:05.057 align:middle line:84%
And so -- so that little landing
thing, the bottom of the saucer,

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:06.225 align:middle line:84%
is right out of  Forbidden
Planet .

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:08.361 align:middle line:84%
It was built for
Forbidden Planet , and so --

00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:11.731 align:middle line:84%
so  Twilight Zone  benefitted
from that enormous wealth of --

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.733 align:middle line:84%
of props and costumes and
sets that they could access.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.601 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Who's the guy's voice?

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:18.671 align:middle line:84%
The announcer's voice when you
heard that at the beginning?

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:19.739 align:middle line:90%
Because I've heard him...

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:20.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:22.041 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...on other things.

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:23.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah, well
Marvin Miller was a terrific --

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:25.344 align:middle line:84%
terrific old voiceover
guy, so yeah.

00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:26.145 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:26.946 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:28.080 align:middle line:90%
That's -- that's great, so.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.282 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
you know what's so great

00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:32.251 align:middle line:84%
about what Serling did,
too, is he created jobs...

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.252 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...for emerging people.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.322 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Writers, talent,

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:38.457 align:middle line:84%
people who really
never would have had

00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:40.059 align:middle line:90%
that opportunity in Hollywood.

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:40.893 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: That's right.

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:42.228 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know it's very funny

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:43.496 align:middle line:84%
because Charles Beaumont had
already been writing for TV,

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:46.364 align:middle line:84%
but westerns, things like
Wanted Dead or Alive ,

00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:47.867 align:middle line:84%
and he was used to
writing stuff,

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.702 align:middle line:84%
and they would just take it,
and chew it up, and spit it out,

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:51.003 align:middle line:90%
and it wouldn't bear anything --

00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:53.005 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't look anything
like what he'd written.

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:55.141 align:middle line:84%
And Rod said to him,
"You write it,

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:56.309 align:middle line:90%
and we'll shoot what you write.

00:12:56.309 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:90%
We will honor you as a writer."

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.745 align:middle line:84%
And Beaumont thought,
"Well, good luck with that."

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:01.214 align:middle line:84%
But he said, "Well, I'll --
I'll just take a run at it,"

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:03.649 align:middle line:84%
and he wrote the script,
and he was astonished

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:05.084 align:middle line:90%
that Rod shot what he wrote.

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:06.819 align:middle line:84%
And I -- I've seen the first
drafts of these scripts

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
by Richard Matheson,
and Beaumont,

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.189 align:middle line:84%
and George Clayton Johnson,
and that's what they shot.

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:13.426 align:middle line:84%
And in fact when Rod
won his second Emmy

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:15.528 align:middle line:84%
for  Twilight Zone  he
held it up on camera,

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:17.096 align:middle line:84%
and he named [laughter] -- he
named George Clayton Johnson,

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:18.397 align:middle line:84%
and Charles Beaumont,
and Richard Matheson.

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:19.665 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Class.

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: He said,
"Come over to my house, guys,

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and we'll carve this
up like a turkey."

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.768 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:23.703 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: So that was --
yeah, exactly, a classy guy.

00:13:23.703 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Class all the way.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah,
you got it.

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:26.873 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's take
some questions for Marc Zicree

00:13:26.873 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:90%
about  The Twilight Zone .

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.407 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:31.143 align:middle line:90%
It's one of our favorites.

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:34.313 align:middle line:90%
Don't be shy.

00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:37.884 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing such a thorough job
[laughter] you don't have any

00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:40.453 align:middle line:90%
questions, right?

00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:41.153 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah?

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think the -- the show
would have been as good in color

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.958 align:middle line:90%
as it was in black-and-white?

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.493 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: You know I --
I love the black-and-white.

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:51.497 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's the greatest
black-and-white television show

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.098 align:middle line:90%
ever made.

00:13:52.098 --> 00:13:53.232 align:middle line:90%
It's gorgeous.

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:54.634 align:middle line:84%
George Clemens was the
Director of Photography,

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:56.769 align:middle line:84%
and he had been a cameraman
on you know Valentino's  Blood

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.771 align:middle line:84%
and Sand  and Fredric
March  Jekyll and Hyde .

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:01.774 align:middle line:84%
He'd really learned his craft,
and so it's -- it's gorgeous.

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.242 align:middle line:84%
I think -- I think if
it had been in color --

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:04.243 align:middle line:84%
in color it wouldn't
have been as good.

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:05.845 align:middle line:84%
I think it would
have lost something.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.613 align:middle line:84%
And you know when they
brought  Twilight Zone  back

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:10.283 align:middle line:84%
as a series a couple times in
more recent years they shot it

00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:12.184 align:middle line:84%
in color, and so it was
missing Rod Serling,

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.619 align:middle line:84%
and it was missing
black-and-white, and it --

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:15.988 align:middle line:84%
and both times it just
wasn't what the original show

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:17.089 align:middle line:90%
had been.

00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I think
you're right, Marc.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.259 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
when the subsequent show,

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:21.694 align:middle line:90%
Night Gallery , came out...

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:22.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:14:22.662 --> 00:14:23.663 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...it was in color,

00:14:23.663 --> 00:14:26.132 align:middle line:84%
and I remember feeling
disappointed.

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:26.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You know I --

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.603 align:middle line:84%
I wanted that Rod
Serling-esque feel,

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:33.072 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't have total
control on  Night Gallery .

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:33.572 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: No, he didn't.

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:90%
He didn't.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.474 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But
I think when we went

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:36.943 align:middle line:90%
from black-and-white to color...

00:14:36.943 --> 00:14:37.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:38.711 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: ...it kind

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:39.812 align:middle line:84%
of changed the mood
and the feeling.

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.213 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah,
and you know it's --

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:45.484 align:middle line:84%
there's just something so classy
about black-and-white, and so --

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you look at the
lighting on the actor's faces,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.788 align:middle line:84%
or they'd -- they'd
wet down the streets,

00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:51.223 align:middle line:84%
and you'd see those reflections,
and it just takes you

00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:52.358 align:middle line:90%
into that world you know.

00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:53.726 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because
the current wisdom --

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.328 align:middle line:84%
wisdom now is that people don't
want to see black-and-white,

00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:58.864 align:middle line:84%
but I think that wisdom is wrong
[laughter], because I think

00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:01.634 align:middle line:84%
when something is done
brilliantly people will --

00:15:01.634 --> 00:15:02.969 align:middle line:90%
will go where it takes you.

00:15:02.969 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Talking about
technology, we've got a...

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.771 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:06.572 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...question from you --

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:07.673 align:middle line:90%
for you, Marc, way out here.

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:08.808 align:middle line:90%
Let's listen in.

00:15:08.808 --> 00:15:09.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Marc.

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:11.544 align:middle line:90%
This is Leah from Philly,

00:15:11.544 --> 00:15:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and I want to know why
you think Rod Serling was

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.515 align:middle line:90%
so far ahead of his time.

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:18.951 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And he was,
yes, so far ahead of his time.

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:21.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: You know, it's
fascinating because Rod was a --

00:15:21.187 --> 00:15:24.256 align:middle line:84%
during the 50s he was writing
realistic, hard-hitting dramas

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.592 align:middle line:84%
for -- for live television,
like  Requiem for a Heavyweight

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.627 align:middle line:84%
and  Patterns , and he was
winning all these Emmys.

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:29.895 align:middle line:84%
But whenever he tried
to write something

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:32.864 align:middle line:84%
that was controversial
dealing with politics, or race,

00:15:32.864 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:84%
or social issues,
they would censor him,

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.836 align:middle line:84%
and so his message
would be totally lost.

00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:39.705 align:middle line:84%
And so he wrote  Twilight Zone
not because he wanted to escape

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:43.075 align:middle line:84%
from reality, but his idea
was to hide his message

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:45.845 align:middle line:84%
so the censors wouldn't get
it, but the audience would.

00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:48.748 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that
he made it timeless,

00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:50.316 align:middle line:84%
because if you see something
like "Eye of the Beholder"

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:51.917 align:middle line:84%
where the woman's head
is wrapped in bandages,

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:53.319 align:middle line:84%
and she just wants
to look normal,

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:54.687 align:middle line:84%
or at least [laughter]
accepted as normal.

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:55.921 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
I know that one.

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:57.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: It's great,
and he's dealing with --

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.791 align:middle line:84%
you know when you think
about issues of dealing

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.494 align:middle line:84%
with the handicapped and the
disabled, and here's Rod have --

00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:04.530 align:middle line:84%
writing this role for this woman
who's supposedly disfigured,

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.232 align:middle line:84%
but she just wants
to be accepted.

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:09.168 align:middle line:84%
And -- and so he was ahead of
his time because he was coming

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:12.371 align:middle line:84%
from a deep, deep
understanding of humanity

00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:13.973 align:middle line:90%
and a deep compassion.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.107 align:middle line:90%
And I think when you come

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:17.076 align:middle line:84%
from those places
your work will speak

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:18.277 align:middle line:90%
to generation after generation.

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:20.246 align:middle line:90%
It won't -- it won't be dated.

00:16:20.246 --> 00:16:22.048 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating because
Twilight Zone  doesn't

00:16:22.048 --> 00:16:22.848 align:middle line:90%
feel dated.

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:23.916 align:middle line:90%
You watch those episodes...

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.317 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Oh,
timeless, timeless.

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:26.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, I mean, an
old woman who's afraid of death.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:28.587 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's going
to be with us forever.

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:30.756 align:middle line:84%
We're all -- we're all afraid
of death one way or another.

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.758 align:middle line:84%
And so these are issues
that are with us --

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:84%
the issues of life and
death, and meaning,

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.328 align:middle line:90%
and finding a meaningful life.

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:39.698 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you couldn't choose
subjects more -- more important.

00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:41.333 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Two great
actors who are no longer

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:44.303 align:middle line:84%
with us, Jack Klugman
and Jonathan Winters...

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:45.671 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:46.939 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: "A Game of
Pool," what's that all about?

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:48.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, it's
a great piece of writing.

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:49.708 align:middle line:84%
And you know many of these
Twilight Zone  episodes take

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:53.079 align:middle line:84%
place in one room or just a few
rooms, beautifully contained.

00:16:53.079 --> 00:16:56.348 align:middle line:84%
And this is about a pool player
who wants to be the best,

00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:58.217 align:middle line:84%
but the best pool
player ever has died,

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.653 align:middle line:84%
and so he challenges this
pool player to come back

00:17:00.653 --> 00:17:02.655 align:middle line:84%
from the other side
to play a game of pool

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:05.291 align:middle line:84%
with very high stakes,
life and death.

00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:06.558 align:middle line:84%
And Jack Klugman
of course was one

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:07.793 align:middle line:90%
of Serling's favorite actors.

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.128 align:middle line:84%
He was in a number of
Twilight Zone  episodes,

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:10.930 align:middle line:84%
four  Twilight Zone
episodes, in fact.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.265 align:middle line:84%
Brilliant actor, and this
is before  The Odd Couple ,

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:14.533 align:middle line:84%
before a lot of things
that broadened...

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:15.868 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: This was
before he was a superstar.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:16.568 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right?

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Definitely,
and then Jonathan Winters,

00:17:19.105 --> 00:17:19.805 align:middle line:84%
it's fascinating because
George Clayton Johnson wrote

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:21.172 align:middle line:90%
that script, and in --

00:17:21.172 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:84%
in the description in the script
he was envisioning Burl Ives

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.211 align:middle line:90%
to play the fat...

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.211 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Hmm-mm.

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...the
fat pool player.

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:29.715 align:middle line:84%
But  Twilight Zone  like
often to cast against type.

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:31.984 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And they
cast numerous comedians

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:34.186 align:middle line:84%
in serious roles, and
Jonathan Winters was one

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.287 align:middle line:84%
of the top comedians
of the time,

00:17:35.287 --> 00:17:36.222 align:middle line:90%
and interestingly enough...

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:37.056 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
He did a good job.

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.257 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, he had --

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:39.024 align:middle line:84%
Jonathan Winters had just
had a nervous breakdown,

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:39.925 align:middle line:90%
and this was the first...

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh, really?

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: This was
the first acting role he did

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:84%
after coming out of the
-- the mental institution.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.199 align:middle line:84%
And -- and Buzz Kulik was the
director, a very solid director

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.902 align:middle line:84%
of drama, and he and Jonathan
Winters talked very, very,

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:84%
you know, intently about
how to do the role.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.838 align:middle line:84%
And Winters was a
little nervous,

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:54.807 align:middle line:84%
but he really --
really nailed it.

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:55.841 align:middle line:90%
He did a great job.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:57.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well
let's take a look.

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.512 align:middle line:90%
>> Then what?

00:17:59.512 --> 00:18:03.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Something to make my
long journey worthwhile.

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.551 align:middle line:90%
>> Name it.

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:09.155 align:middle line:84%
>> You said you'd give
anything for a game with me.

00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:10.222 align:middle line:90%
Anything?

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:14.727 align:middle line:84%
>> What are you talking
about, Mister?

00:18:14.727 --> 00:18:18.764 align:middle line:84%
Just what kind of stakes
are you talking about?

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Life or death.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.936 align:middle line:90%
You beat me, and you live.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:27.373 align:middle line:84%
You lose, and you die
[Background Music].

00:18:27.373 --> 00:18:28.941 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Those
are high stakes, Marc.

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:29.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes,
they are, indeed.

00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:31.243 align:middle line:90%
They are, indeed.

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:33.813 align:middle line:84%
And -- but again, these --
these two actors are so present

00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:36.148 align:middle line:84%
to the material, and -- and
Jack Klugman just anchors it.

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.184 align:middle line:84%
And he -- Jack Klugman's
so great

00:18:38.184 --> 00:18:41.554 align:middle line:84%
at playing longing
and intensity.

00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:44.056 align:middle line:84%
And -- and, you know,  Twilight
Zone  often brought the best

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.025 align:middle line:84%
performances in many of these
actors because as much as I

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:48.127 align:middle line:84%
like Jack Klugman
in  The Odd Couple

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.628 align:middle line:90%
and later as Quincy you know...

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:50.763 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:18:50.763 --> 00:18:52.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: You know
his best work really is

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:54.533 align:middle line:84%
in  Twilight Zone , and if
you look at this or in "Praise

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:56.435 align:middle line:84%
of Pip," or "Passage for
Trumpet," or "Death Ship,"

00:18:56.435 --> 00:18:58.904 align:middle line:84%
another episode he
did, he's phenomenal.

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:00.039 align:middle line:90%
He's phenomenal.

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:02.241 align:middle line:84%
And I remember in one
of Rod's scripts in --

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
in "Passage for Trumpet,"
the first  Twilight Zone

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.413 align:middle line:84%
that Jack Klugman did, there's
a moment where Rod says --

00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:10.282 align:middle line:84%
Jack Klugman's character's
talking to this girl,

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:12.084 align:middle line:84%
and he's a lonely man,
and there's a possibility

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:15.154 align:middle line:84%
of a relationship, and -- and
Rod wrote, "His face lights

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.089 align:middle line:90%
up like 1,000-watt bulb."

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:18.958 align:middle line:84%
And Jack Klugman --
Klugman just does that.

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.092 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
were telling me once

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:22.194 align:middle line:84%
that you were rummaging
around Serling's attic.

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:23.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes!

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:24.263 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: His wife
Carol said, "Go on up,

00:19:24.263 --> 00:19:25.231 align:middle line:90%
and do what you have to do."

00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:26.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: That's right.

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:27.233 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
found some episodes...

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:28.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: That's right.

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:29.335 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...that
were never put to film.

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:30.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: That's right.

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, I started writing  The
Twilight Zone Companion

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.438 align:middle line:90%
when I was 22 years old.

00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:33.639 align:middle line:84%
I was right out --
right out of college.

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:35.474 align:middle line:84%
It was two years
after Rod's death.

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:37.009 align:middle line:90%
He died very early at 50...

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:37.843 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:38.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: ...as you know.

00:19:38.811 --> 00:19:40.212 align:middle line:84%
And so I approached
Carol Serling.

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:41.614 align:middle line:84%
I'd already been interviewing
a number of people who'd worked

00:19:41.614 --> 00:19:45.417 align:middle line:84%
on the show, and -- and she gave
me full access to everything.

00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:47.853 align:middle line:84%
So Rod -- Rod's scripts
and scrapbooks were up --

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:50.122 align:middle line:84%
were up in the attic of this
big house in Pacific Palisades,

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:51.390 align:middle line:90%
so I was literally crawling

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.826 align:middle line:84%
through Rod's attic,
and I found this box.

00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:55.995 align:middle line:84%
And it was an unmarked
box, and I opened it up,

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:57.229 align:middle line:84%
and there were  Twilight
Zone  scripts

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.797 align:middle line:84%
that were written
but never made.

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:01.467 align:middle line:84%
There were two by Ray Bradbury;
there were several by Serling;

00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:03.936 align:middle line:84%
several by Charles
Beaumont and Matheson.

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:05.604 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a treasure
trove; it was amazing,

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:07.006 align:middle line:90%
phenomenal -- phenomenal stuff.

00:20:07.006 --> 00:20:09.174 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's go back
to our  Beyond Belief  cam

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:11.844 align:middle line:84%
and take another
question for Marc Zicree.

00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:12.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Marc.

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:14.546 align:middle line:90%
I'm David from Austin.

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:16.849 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered, who
was the voice of the doll

00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:19.618 align:middle line:84%
in the  Twilight Zone
episode "Living Doll"?

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: June
Foray, who was the voice

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
of Rocky the Flying Squirrel,
is the voice of Talky Tina.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.159 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly enough she was
also the voice of Chatty Cathy,

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:28.494 align:middle line:90%
which was the very popular...

00:20:28.494 --> 00:20:29.461 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh, sure.

00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:30.396 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...doll
at the time.

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Pull thing, yeah.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: That's right.

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:33.299 align:middle line:84%
"The Living Doll" is basically
doing a -- doing a riff on.

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:34.533 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And so she's
just absolutely perfect;

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.368 align:middle line:90%
couldn't be better.

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:37.469 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
know the great story

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:39.972 align:middle line:90%
of my little granddaughter Mia.

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:46.245 align:middle line:84%
I bought her that little doll,
and it's a scary little doll.

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.047 align:middle line:90%
It -- it really is.

00:20:48.047 --> 00:20:50.416 align:middle line:84%
And my -- my daughter,
her mother,

00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:52.351 align:middle line:90%
had it put on her counter.

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:53.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Hmm-mm.

00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:54.119 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
so she would see it

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:55.688 align:middle line:90%
when she went to bed.

00:20:55.688 --> 00:20:59.224 align:middle line:84%
And she'd look at it and
go, "Mom, put it back."

00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:01.493 align:middle line:84%
So she'd have to
literally take that doll...

00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:02.861 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:03.862 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...and put
it in just -- and cover it up.

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Wow.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.632 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: She -- she
wanted nothing to do with that.

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah, well
you know  Twilight Zone  goes

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.868 align:middle line:90%
to some pretty dark places.

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:12.905 align:middle line:84%
And -- and it's funny because
Rod did not even let his own

00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:84%
children watch  The
Twilight Zone

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.808 align:middle line:90%
when it was on the network.

00:21:15.808 --> 00:21:18.711 align:middle line:84%
And Anne Serling told me
that one time she crept

00:21:18.711 --> 00:21:21.313 align:middle line:84%
down past her bedtime and
looked through the bannister,

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.815 align:middle line:84%
and her parents were
watching one of the episodes

00:21:22.815 --> 00:21:25.250 align:middle line:84%
of  Twilight Zone ; it was
"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,"

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.885 align:middle line:84%
and the one with the
gremlin on the wing.

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:29.355 align:middle line:84%
And -- and it scared her
to death, and she thought,

00:21:29.355 --> 00:21:32.191 align:middle line:84%
"This is what my daddy does
for a living [laughter]?"

00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:34.326 align:middle line:90%
So -- so it was -- but yeah.

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:35.594 align:middle line:84%
They're -- they're
indelible images.

00:21:35.594 --> 00:21:37.196 align:middle line:84%
There's -- they just --
they stay with you forever.

00:21:37.196 --> 00:21:39.865 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How popular
was the show in the ratings?

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:42.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: It -- well, the
funny thing is it was popular,

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.769 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't a top-rated show.

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:46.338 align:middle line:84%
But the fascinating thing is
compared to the audiences now,

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:48.307 align:middle line:84%
you know a show now
on the network on CBS

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:51.643 align:middle line:84%
if they get 10 million
viewers that's a huge hit.

00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:53.078 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:53.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree:  The Twilight
Zone  was getting 40 million,

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:54.313 align:middle line:90%
and that...

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:55.013 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Whoa!

00:21:55.013 --> 00:21:56.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:21:56.348 --> 00:21:57.683 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Of course,
you only had three networks.

00:21:57.683 --> 00:21:58.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: There were
only three networks, exactly.

00:21:58.884 --> 00:22:00.018 align:middle line:84%
And -- and of course this
was before home videos,

00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
so you couldn't record a
show and watch it later.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.521 align:middle line:84%
It was on when it was
on, and you watched it.

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:03.522 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
You had to watch it.

00:22:03.522 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah,
and I remember

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.858 align:middle line:84%
when the original
Star Trek  was on.

00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:08.427 align:middle line:84%
I was a kid, and I
recorded them on audio --

00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:09.862 align:middle line:84%
reel-to-reel audiotape
just in case...

00:22:09.862 --> 00:22:11.163 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Could hear them.

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:11.864 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...just in
case it never showed again.

00:22:11.864 --> 00:22:13.232 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:22:13.232 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And so it's a
very different world we live

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.234 align:middle line:90%
in now.

00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:15.801 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah, it is.

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:16.835 align:middle line:90%
It's dramatic.

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:19.571 align:middle line:84%
And when it ended
-- it was on CBS.

00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:20.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:22:20.272 --> 00:22:20.973 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right?

00:22:20.973 --> 00:22:21.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:22.941 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Was Serling upset?

00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:24.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: He
had mixed emotions.

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:25.878 align:middle line:84%
He had written so much over
those years, and also during

00:22:25.878 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
that time he wrote  Seven
Days in May  the movie.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.283 align:middle line:84%
He was writing movies; he
was writing books, as well.

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:34.453 align:middle line:84%
So he was very tired, but -- but
also I think he was a little sad

00:22:34.453 --> 00:22:36.522 align:middle line:84%
that it was canceled,
so he went to ABC,

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:39.124 align:middle line:84%
pitched a show called  Rod
Serling's Wax Museum ,

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:41.527 align:middle line:84%
and it would have been Rod
in a spooky mansion on --

00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:43.362 align:middle line:84%
on an island, and
you would go in,

00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:44.696 align:middle line:84%
and you would see
these wax figures.

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.265 align:middle line:84%
They would all have
hoods over their heads,

00:22:46.265 --> 00:22:48.767 align:middle line:84%
and then he would pull the
hood off, and you'd see the --

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:50.736 align:middle line:84%
a wax figure of that
week's actor,

00:22:50.736 --> 00:22:52.504 align:middle line:84%
and then he would tell the
story, and then you'd go

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:53.572 align:middle line:90%
into the dramatization.

00:22:53.572 --> 00:22:54.673 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Ah, interesting.

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:56.074 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
-- and that didn't --

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:58.177 align:middle line:84%
and he also had done a book
called  Rod Serling's Triple W,"

00:22:58.177 --> 00:23:00.112 align:middle line:84%
which is witches,
werewolves, and warlocks.

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:02.281 align:middle line:84%
And so they talked about
several different ideas, but --

00:23:02.281 --> 00:23:04.016 align:middle line:84%
but it was very clear to
Rod very quickly that --

00:23:04.016 --> 00:23:05.484 align:middle line:84%
that the head of ABC
just wanted to have sort

00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:08.053 align:middle line:84%
of a spook show, and nothing
that would have any meaning,

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:10.255 align:middle line:84%
and so he went to the press
and just said, "Well, you know,

00:23:10.255 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:90%
this isn't going to work."

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.559 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It's
not going to work.

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:14.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: No.

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:15.794 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And he was done.

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:18.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: So I think
he felt very melancholy

00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:19.665 align:middle line:84%
about it being over,
and then he --

00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:22.000 align:middle line:84%
as you said, he tried to
get something going again

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.137 align:middle line:84%
with Night Gallery , but
he didn't have the control

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:27.439 align:middle line:84%
with  Night Gallery , so
there are a few episodes,

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:30.008 align:middle line:84%
like the "Tearing
Down Tim Riley's Bar"

00:23:30.008 --> 00:23:32.344 align:middle line:84%
that are very moving,
very touching, but --

00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:34.346 align:middle line:84%
but he was not happy
with  Night Gallery .

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:37.316 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't his baby like
Twilight Zone  was.

00:23:37.316 --> 00:23:39.451 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: One of
our friends, Billy Mumy...

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:40.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

Billy, of course,

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.121 align:middle line:84%
in a couple  Twilight

00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:43.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:23:43.055 --> 00:23:43.956 align:middle line:84%

And of course was

00:23:43.956 --> 00:23:44.656 align:middle line:90%
in  Lost in Space  [laughter].

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:45.991 align:middle line:90%
He was Will Robinson.

00:23:45.991 --> 00:23:46.658 align:middle line:90%
Great guy.

00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.027 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Musician now,
and just one heck of a person,

00:23:49.027 --> 00:23:49.962 align:middle line:84%
but he was in "It's
a Good Life"...

00:23:49.962 --> 00:23:51.163 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...where
everybody hated him...

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.031 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:53.732 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...as
the little kid [laughter].

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:54.733 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:55.634 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: I
remember it well.

00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:57.402 align:middle line:90%
You bet. It's a great episode.

00:23:57.402 --> 00:24:00.072 align:middle line:84%
It's based on a short
story by Jerome Bixby,

00:24:00.072 --> 00:24:02.574 align:middle line:84%
one of the classic short
stories of science fiction.

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:03.909 align:middle line:90%
Rod adapted it.

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:06.178 align:middle line:84%
He wrote that script in eight
hours, that entire script.

00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:06.879 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That was it?

00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:08.113 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Hmm-mm.

00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:09.748 align:middle line:84%
And  Twilight Zone  was
shot in three days' time.

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:11.650 align:middle line:84%
There was one day of
rehearsal, and then three days,

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.985 align:middle line:90%
and then you were done.

00:24:12.985 --> 00:24:16.388 align:middle line:84%
So it's astonishing; these
classics were made so quickly.

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:18.156 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a superb episode.

00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:19.591 align:middle line:90%
It's a great ensemble piece.

00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:20.959 align:middle line:84%
Cloris Leachman is
terrific in it, John Larch,

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:21.994 align:middle line:90%
and Billy Mumy is phenomenal.

00:24:21.994 --> 00:24:22.828 align:middle line:84%
Just astonishing;
scary, really scary.

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:24.229 align:middle line:90%

And yet you see how
subtle the effects are,

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:02.034 align:middle line:84%

it because it just goes

00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:08.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: And -- and so --

00:25:08.907 --> 00:25:09.675 align:middle line:84%
you know so nowadays they'd do
it with CG, and it'd be bloody,

00:25:09.675 --> 00:25:10.776 align:middle line:90%
and gruesome, and graphic,

00:25:10.776 --> 00:25:12.177 align:middle line:84%
and it would not be
nearly as scary or...

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:13.378 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Exactly.

00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:84%

as effective as that is.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And -- but I'll -- I'll tell
you a funny story, George,

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.782 align:middle line:90%
that I don't think you know,

00:25:16.782 --> 00:25:18.517 align:middle line:84%
which is when I was a kid
the show that Billy Mumy did

00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:20.485 align:middle line:84%
after  Lost in Space  --
after  Twilight Zone  --

00:25:20.485 --> 00:25:21.987 align:middle line:84%
after appearing on  The Twilight
Zone  was  Lost in Space .

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:23.055 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:24.456 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Will
Robinson, of course.

00:25:24.456 --> 00:25:26.858 align:middle line:84%
And I as home sick one day; I
was about maybe seven years old,

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and I decided -- I was a
big fan of  Lost in Space ;

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:29.928 align:middle line:90%
it was on the air at the time.

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I decided to call --
to look up in the --

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.732 align:middle line:84%
in the phone book
the actors from  Lost

00:25:33.732 --> 00:25:35.167 align:middle line:90%
in Space  and talk to them.

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:36.168 align:middle line:90%
I was home alone [laughter].

00:25:36.168 --> 00:25:37.369 align:middle line:90%
And so I started calling...

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:38.303 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And they
were in the phone book?

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:39.504 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, most --

00:25:39.504 --> 00:25:40.872 align:middle line:84%
most of them were guys
who just had the same name

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:41.773 align:middle line:90%
but weren't the right ones.

00:25:41.773 --> 00:25:43.141 align:middle line:90%
But...

00:25:43.141 --> 00:25:44.276 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Nobody had
unlisted numbers then, right.

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:45.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Right,
but there was one Mumy

00:25:45.077 --> 00:25:45.844 align:middle line:90%
in the phone book, only one.

00:25:45.844 --> 00:25:46.979 align:middle line:90%
It must have been his dad.

00:25:46.979 --> 00:25:47.813 align:middle line:84%
So I called, and his --
and his mom answered,

00:25:47.813 --> 00:25:49.181 align:middle line:90%
and I said, "Is Billy there?"

00:25:49.181 --> 00:25:50.916 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Hold on," and
Billy Mumy came to the phone.

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.618 align:middle line:84%
And I was so nervous
I just blurted out,

00:25:52.618 --> 00:25:53.385 align:middle line:90%
"Will you be my friend?"

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.519 align:middle line:90%
And hung up.

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:56.722 align:middle line:84%
But then [laughter] I
-- but I called back.

00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And so my mom took me
to Billy Mumy's house,

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.392 align:middle line:84%
and we got to know each
other when we were kids.

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:01.693 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You're kidding!

00:26:01.693 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah, so
that's how long we go back,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.061 align:middle line:90%
the two of us.

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:03.996 align:middle line:90%
And then we became friends.

00:26:03.996 --> 00:26:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
That's fantastic.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah,
so that's -- so I was --

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:07.399 align:middle line:84%
I was as [laughter]
-- as odd a child

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:08.567 align:middle line:90%
as I am an adult [laughter].

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.102 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Was it --

00:26:10.102 --> 00:26:12.437 align:middle line:84%
was it the  Twilight Zone  that
got him the  Lost in Space  job?

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:13.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: I'm sure
it was a big part of it.

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's just --
we was phenomenal.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And you know to find a child
actor that strong, that good --

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.913 align:middle line:84%
and the funny thing is that
Bill -- Bill told me that he --

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:24.916 align:middle line:84%
he would memorize not only his
own lines, but everyone's lines.

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:26.051 align:middle line:84%
So when they were
doing the table read

00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:26.752 align:middle line:90%
for "It's a Good Life"...

00:26:26.752 --> 00:26:27.853 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Wow.

00:26:27.853 --> 00:26:29.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...you
know Cloris Leachman

00:26:29.187 --> 00:26:30.489 align:middle line:84%
like wouldn't remember her
line, and he would correct her.

00:26:30.489 --> 00:26:32.424 align:middle line:84%
And so having like a
five-year-old kid correct you

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:34.326 align:middle line:84%
on your lines is like not
-- not a pleasant thing.

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:35.293 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
He was a genius.

00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:36.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah,
phenomenal.

00:26:36.662 --> 00:26:37.929 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I remember
when he first did our  Coast

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:40.032 align:middle line:84%
to Coast  show, as the
adult Billy Mumy he came in,

00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:43.301 align:middle line:84%
and he went, "You're a
bad, bad man [laughter]."

00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:45.137 align:middle line:84%
And just -- you know,
I thought I was going

00:26:45.137 --> 00:26:46.505 align:middle line:84%
to become a little
jack-in-the-box...

00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:47.773 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:26:47.773 --> 00:26:48.607 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...or
something like that [laughter].

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:49.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes, yes, yeah.

00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:51.176 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I'm a little
scared still [laughter].

00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:52.344 align:middle line:84%
When you wrote  The
Twilight Zone Companion  ...

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:53.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:54.546 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...did
you have fun doing that?

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:55.781 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah,
it was great fun.

00:26:55.781 --> 00:26:57.349 align:middle line:84%
And just being able to talk
to actors, and writers,

00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:58.917 align:middle line:84%
and directors, and
producers, because I wanted

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:00.852 align:middle line:84%
to have a career as a
writer-producer in television,

00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:02.554 align:middle line:84%
and there were no
classes in that.

00:27:02.554 --> 00:27:03.955 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to
interview these --

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:06.958 align:middle line:84%
the top people in the
industry and learn from them.

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:10.395 align:middle line:84%
And really what I learned
was that you set the bar --

00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:13.298 align:middle line:84%
you set the bar for the quality
of work that you're going to do.

00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:15.133 align:middle line:84%
And -- and it doesn't
matter what the show is,

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.435 align:middle line:84%
what matters is where
you're coming from.

00:27:16.435 --> 00:27:19.071 align:middle line:84%
And -- and really
taking Rod's example,

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:20.939 align:middle line:84%
and George Clayton Johnson,
and Matheson, and Beaumont,

00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:22.307 align:middle line:90%
and these phenomenal writers,

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:23.842 align:middle line:84%
you can create something
lasting,

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:25.143 align:middle line:90%
but you have to set the bar.

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.478 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't -- it's
not happenstance.

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:28.213 align:middle line:84%
It's deliberate choice,
and that's what --

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:30.282 align:middle line:90%
why Rod was so brilliant.

00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:32.017 align:middle line:84%
And even when the networks
tried to silence him,

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:34.753 align:middle line:84%
and even when they wouldn't let
him say what he wanted to say

00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:36.121 align:middle line:84%
on  Playhouse 90 ,
he skunked them.

00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:38.056 align:middle line:84%
He came up with an
alternative, and it worked.

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:39.191 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:40.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And --
and the lo0vely thing is

00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:42.561 align:middle line:84%
that had he been writing
directly about the issues

00:27:42.561 --> 00:27:45.297 align:middle line:84%
of the day it wouldn't have
been timeless the way it is now.

00:27:45.297 --> 00:27:48.166 align:middle line:84%
So in a way the censors helped
him create something that --

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:49.668 align:middle line:84%
that was timeless
and such a classic.

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:50.836 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Now
Hollywood would call

00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:52.504 align:middle line:90%
that anthology, right?

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:53.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes, yes.

00:27:53.638 --> 00:27:55.006 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Would
anthology work today?

00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:56.808 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, you
know the networks really don't

00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:59.211 align:middle line:84%
like anthologies, but every
few years another one pops up.

00:27:59.211 --> 00:28:01.246 align:middle line:84%
Bryan Singer -- Bryan Singer
has just announced he's going

00:28:01.246 --> 00:28:02.380 align:middle line:84%
to be doing a new
Twilight Zone .

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.149 align:middle line:90%
We'll see how it is.

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:05.584 align:middle line:84%
I -- you know I'm
-- I'm open-minded.

00:28:05.584 --> 00:28:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo DiCaprio's been trying
to do a  Twilight Zone  movie

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.921 align:middle line:90%
with Legendary Pictures.

00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Again, these things
are in development.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.191 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, they --
they won't have Rod.

00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:14.292 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: No.

00:28:14.292 --> 00:28:15.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: What
you really need is...

00:28:15.227 --> 00:28:16.027 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It's not the same.

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:17.329 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, you --

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:18.730 align:middle line:84%
with all the science fiction
shows you need a visionary

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.733 align:middle line:84%
at the top, whether it's Rod, or
Gene Roddenberry, or Ron Moore

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:24.436 align:middle line:84%
with the recent  Battlestar
Galactica , you know or --

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:27.272 align:middle line:84%
or any of these people,
or J.J. You need someone

00:28:27.272 --> 00:28:30.909 align:middle line:84%
who has the vision, and without
that it's just going to be,

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:32.077 align:middle line:90%
you know, hit-and-miss.

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:33.378 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: And --

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:35.547 align:middle line:84%
and I really don't think you
can duplicate excellence.

00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:36.381 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: No.

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:37.382 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You should come

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:38.350 align:middle line:84%
up with your own
different idea, maybe...

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:40.585 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...a different
offshoot, or a different flare,

00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:90%
but to try to duplicate it...

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.687 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: No.

00:28:42.687 --> 00:28:43.522 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...I think it's a --

00:28:43.522 --> 00:28:45.023 align:middle line:90%
you know a calling for disaster.

00:28:45.023 --> 00:28:46.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah, and
I always have an open mind

00:28:46.525 --> 00:28:49.194 align:middle line:84%
for these things, and I -- I
wish all of these people luck

00:28:49.194 --> 00:28:50.595 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
coming from cynicism.

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:52.164 align:middle line:90%
They love  The Twilight Zone .

00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:54.633 align:middle line:84%
Bryan Singer, and I've met
him, and I've talked to him,

00:28:54.633 --> 00:28:56.368 align:middle line:84%
and Leonardo DiCaprio;
they love  Twilight Zone .

00:28:56.368 --> 00:28:58.136 align:middle line:84%
They -- they're not
trying to wreck something;

00:28:58.136 --> 00:28:59.738 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to honor it.

00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:01.406 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be -- either be
good, bad, or indifferent.

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:02.908 align:middle line:90%
We'll find out, won't we?

00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:04.009 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I think  The
Twilight Zone  had a lot to do

00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:05.977 align:middle line:90%
with me going into broadcasting,

00:29:05.977 --> 00:29:08.513 align:middle line:84%
to try to unravel some
of these mysteries...

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:09.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:10.348 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...and these stories.

00:29:10.348 --> 00:29:11.049 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he opened up my mind...

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:12.117 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:29:12.117 --> 00:29:13.185 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...to
do a lot of that.

00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:15.487 align:middle line:84%
In our next clip, "A
Little Girl Lost"...

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:16.488 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Hmm-mm.

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:17.689 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...tell us about that.

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:18.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: "A Little
Girl Lost" is a script

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:20.926 align:middle line:84%
by Richard Matheson; it's
based on his short story,

00:29:20.926 --> 00:29:23.628 align:middle line:84%
and Matheson was raising
several daughters,

00:29:23.628 --> 00:29:25.864 align:middle line:84%
and one night he heard
his little girl crying

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:29.100 align:middle line:84%
for her bedroom, and he went
in, and she wasn't on the bed.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.502 align:middle line:84%
So he thought, "Oh, well
she must have you know,

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:31.870 align:middle line:84%
well maybe fallen under
the bed or whatever."

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.439 align:middle line:84%
So he reached under the bed,
and she wasn't there [laughter].

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:36.741 align:middle line:84%
And he thought -- and it
was the strangest thing

00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:37.976 align:middle line:84%
because he could
hear her crying,

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:39.511 align:middle line:90%
but he couldn't find her.

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:40.078 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: "Daddy!

00:29:40.078 --> 00:29:41.046 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?"

00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
what happened

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.181 align:middle line:84%
in reality was she had
actually rolled all the way

00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:44.216 align:middle line:90%
up against the wall.

00:29:44.216 --> 00:29:45.317 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Hmm-mm.

00:29:45.317 --> 00:29:46.017 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
so he hadn't been able

00:29:46.017 --> 00:29:47.152 align:middle line:90%
to reach her initially.

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:47.986 align:middle line:84%
They found her, of
course, and comforted her.

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:49.054 align:middle line:90%
But then his mind started going.

00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:50.021 align:middle line:84%
He thought, "Well,
what if she had fallen

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:50.789 align:middle line:84%
through a hole between
dimensions?"

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Perfect.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:52.991 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And so
that's what happens.

00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:53.692 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
that's what we have...

00:29:53.692 --> 00:29:54.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:55.327 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: ...right here.

00:29:55.327 --> 00:29:56.161 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Here we go.

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:57.095 align:middle line:90%
>> [Crying] Tina, take my hand.

00:29:57.095 --> 00:29:58.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Chris, don't.

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:01.032 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music]
My hand, honey.

00:30:01.032 --> 00:30:03.001 align:middle line:90%
Take a hold of it.

00:30:03.001 --> 00:30:05.537 align:middle line:90%
Here. Here!

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:07.739 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't see it, Daddy.

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:08.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Here, honey.

00:30:08.406 --> 00:30:10.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Chris!

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:16.615 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you hear me --
hear me -- hear me?

00:30:16.615 --> 00:30:17.849 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right here, pal.

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:18.717 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't move.

00:30:18.717 --> 00:30:19.417 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got time
-- time -- time.

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:20.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't move an inch.

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:24.022 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got time
-- time -- time.

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:25.824 align:middle line:90%
>> Let her come to you, Chris.

00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:27.893 align:middle line:90%
Call her.

00:30:27.893 --> 00:30:29.361 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
they ultimately got her,

00:30:29.361 --> 00:30:30.595 align:middle line:90%
and I remember...

00:30:30.595 --> 00:30:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:32.831 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...the hole
was starting to seal up.

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:33.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:34.299 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Remember?

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:36.534 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So he had to
get her fast and get back out.

00:30:36.534 --> 00:30:37.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: That's right,

00:30:37.569 --> 00:30:38.403 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell you a
fascinating bit --

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:39.337 align:middle line:90%
bit of trivia on that episode.

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:40.605 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays of course
you'd do that --

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:42.274 align:middle line:84%
that wall where people
go through it with --

00:30:42.274 --> 00:30:43.341 align:middle line:90%
you know with special effects...

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:44.309 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:45.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree:
...post-production.

00:30:45.377 --> 00:30:46.211 align:middle line:84%
And that -- that is
not post-production.

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:47.445 align:middle line:90%
That's not special effects.

00:30:47.445 --> 00:30:49.014 align:middle line:84%
What it was was George
Clemens who was the Director

00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:50.982 align:middle line:84%
of Photography, he --
he knew a lot of tricks.

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:53.218 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "What we can
do is we can build the wall

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:55.453 align:middle line:84%
so there'll be a depression
in the wall, and we'll shoot

00:30:55.453 --> 00:30:57.088 align:middle line:84%
at an angle and flood it
with so much light..."

00:30:57.088 --> 00:30:58.156 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And he'll
fall through the depression.

00:30:58.156 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: "...that
it'll look like --

00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.891 align:middle line:84%
it'll look like a
flat -- flat wall."

00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:01.326 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:02.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And so when
he's putting his hand through

00:31:02.661 --> 00:31:03.528 align:middle line:84%
and then falling through,
that's just a little depression

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:04.496 align:middle line:90%
in that wall there that was...

00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:05.363 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Great creativity...

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:06.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Amazing,
amazing.

00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:07.299 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...in those days.

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah,
it just works.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.834 align:middle line:84%
And -- and Charles Aidman
who plays the scientist

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:12.137 align:middle line:84%
who describes the parallel
dimension, the alternate world,

00:31:12.137 --> 00:31:15.340 align:middle line:84%
he's so good at just
making that seem so concrete

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.842 align:middle line:84%
because  Twilight Zone  -- what
Matheson told me was you take --

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:20.912 align:middle line:84%
you would have one change --
you'd put one drop of fantasy

00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:23.148 align:middle line:84%
into it and then write
everything else realistically,

00:31:23.148 --> 00:31:24.849 align:middle line:84%
and that's what makes
those stories work.

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:26.584 align:middle line:84%
And they really knew
their stuff.

00:31:26.584 --> 00:31:27.752 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What
did the critics say?

00:31:27.752 --> 00:31:30.388 align:middle line:84%
In those days it was
the newspaper critic...

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:31.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:31:31.523 --> 00:31:32.457 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...that
carried a lot of weight.

00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:33.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:34.759 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What did they
say about  The Twilight Zone ?

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:36.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: They liked it.

00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:37.495 align:middle line:84%
It's funny because Rod
actually had to write a number

00:31:37.495 --> 00:31:39.898 align:middle line:84%
of  Twilight Zone  pilot scripts
before he could get the network

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.299 align:middle line:90%
and the sponsors to approve it

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:43.735 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
get what he was doing.

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:45.136 align:middle line:84%
And he -- he ultimately
had to write -- the --

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:46.705 align:middle line:84%
the final pilot that's
on the show was very,

00:31:46.705 --> 00:31:47.839 align:middle line:90%
very kind of earth-bound.

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:48.907 align:middle line:84%
It was -- it was
not as bizarre...

00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:49.908 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Did
the pilot ever air?

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:50.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: It did.

00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Where
is Everybody?"

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.445 align:middle line:84%
And it's about a guy who's
wandering a deserted town.

00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:55.613 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't remember who he
is, and then he wakes up,

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and he's an astronaut in an
isolation booth experiment.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:00.118 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Hmm-mm.

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:00.952 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
he's just kind

00:32:00.952 --> 00:32:02.120 align:middle line:90%
of hallucinated the whole story,

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.521 align:middle line:84%
so there's really no
fantasy element at all,

00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:05.390 align:middle line:84%
but that was prosaic enough and
earth-bound enough to get the --

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.292 align:middle line:84%
the networks and the
sponsors to say, "Yes."

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And then Rod Serling
went hog wild

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.595 align:middle line:84%
and was doing you know guys
falling in love with robots

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:13.031 align:middle line:84%
and all [laughter] these
things, but -- but the --

00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:17.035 align:middle line:84%
the critics liked it, and
Rod won the Emmy for --

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:18.737 align:middle line:90%
for best drama that year.

00:32:18.737 --> 00:32:20.205 align:middle line:84%
He won two Emmys for
Twilight Zone , and he was --

00:32:20.205 --> 00:32:22.440 align:middle line:84%
he so did not expect
to win that first Emmy

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.575 align:middle line:90%
for  Twilight Zone  --

00:32:23.575 --> 00:32:25.310 align:middle line:84%
he expected one of the
other nominees to win --

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.978 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't even
shave that afternoon.

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:28.246 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Wow.

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:29.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: So he had
this five o'clock shadow.

00:32:29.381 --> 00:32:30.882 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "I don't
know how deserving I am,

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:32.250 align:middle line:84%
but I do know how
grateful I am."

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.385 align:middle line:90%
That was his acceptance speech.

00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:34.686 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Did he
pitch all the networks?

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:35.887 align:middle line:90%
Or just CBS?

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:36.588 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: No, it
was CBS because CBS had --

00:32:36.588 --> 00:32:37.822 align:middle line:90%
had him under contract.

00:32:37.822 --> 00:32:39.257 align:middle line:84%
He was writing for
Playhouse 90  which was sort

00:32:39.257 --> 00:32:40.191 align:middle line:90%
of their flagship show.

00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:41.626 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:43.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And the first
Twilight Zone  script he wrote

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:84%
was something called
"The Time Element,"

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.866 align:middle line:84%
and it was an hour-long script
about a guy going back in time

00:32:47.866 --> 00:32:50.168 align:middle line:84%
to Pearl Harbor and trying to
warn about the eminent attack.

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:51.136 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Ah.

00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
CBS shelved it.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.471 align:middle line:84%
There were never
going to make it.

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But there was a producer named
Bert Granite doing a show called

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Desilu Playhouse , and it
was -- was an anthology show.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:02.414 align:middle line:84%
Three -- three episodes out
of the month would be dramas,

00:33:02.414 --> 00:33:06.217 align:middle line:84%
and then the fourth one would be
a Lucy, you know, Desi episode.

00:33:06.217 --> 00:33:06.918 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:33:06.918 --> 00:33:08.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Right?

00:33:08.253 --> 00:33:09.320 align:middle line:84%
It would be like an hour-long
I Love Lucy  episode.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.422 align:middle line:84%
And he -- he wanted
a Rod Serling script

00:33:10.422 --> 00:33:11.856 align:middle line:84%
but couldn't afford how
expensive they were,

00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:13.324 align:middle line:84%
but then he heard there was
this script just sitting

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:15.894 align:middle line:84%
on the shelf, and he was able
to buy that for a lower sum,

00:33:15.894 --> 00:33:18.563 align:middle line:84%
and he aired it, and it was
the most popular episode

00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:21.066 align:middle line:84%
of  Desilu Playhouse  that
year; it got the most mail.

00:33:21.066 --> 00:33:23.001 align:middle line:84%
And -- and that convinced
CBS to --

00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:24.803 align:middle line:84%
to have Rod write another
Twilight Zone  pilot,

00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:26.538 align:middle line:84%
but the funny thing
is that the --

00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:29.674 align:middle line:84%
the first host of any  Twilight
Zone  episode was not Rod;

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:30.675 align:middle line:90%
it was Desi Arnaz.

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:32.077 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's right.

00:33:32.077 --> 00:33:33.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And at the end
he comes out on "Time Element,"

00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:34.045 align:middle line:84%
he says, "Did you
understand that?

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:34.879 align:middle line:84%
I don't -- I don't
get it [laughter]."

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:90%
You know so [laughter].

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.815 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Didn't Lucille Ball...

00:33:36.815 --> 00:33:38.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Right.

00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...have a
lot to do with the success

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.185 align:middle line:90%
of  The Twilight Zone ?

00:33:40.185 --> 00:33:41.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, you
know Lucille Ball was the head

00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:43.054 align:middle line:84%
of Desilu, she and
Desi Arnaz, so again,

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:44.889 align:middle line:84%
if not for Lucille
Ball -- and she also --

00:33:44.889 --> 00:33:47.292 align:middle line:84%
with  Star Trek  she was --
her studio made  Star Trek ,

00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:50.662 align:middle line:84%
the original  Star Trek  pilot,
and so Lucille Ball is one

00:33:50.662 --> 00:33:51.896 align:middle line:90%
of the great unsung heroes of --

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:54.566 align:middle line:84%
of both  Twilight
Zone  and  Star Trek .

00:33:54.566 --> 00:33:56.167 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Our last
clip, "Midnight Sun."

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:57.569 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that one.

00:33:57.569 --> 00:33:58.736 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, you know
"Midnight Sun" is another one

00:33:58.736 --> 00:34:00.371 align:middle line:90%
of these great what-if stories

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:03.308 align:middle line:84%
where basically the earth
is moving closer to the sun,

00:34:03.308 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's burning
up as the...

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.211 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Ooh.

00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:07.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...temperature's
rising.

00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:08.146 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Possibilities.

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes,
and so global warming.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.116 align:middle line:84%
This is, again, another
story well before its time.

00:34:11.116 --> 00:34:12.317 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:34:12.317 --> 00:34:13.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: So, yeah,
let's take a look at it.

00:34:13.617 --> 00:34:15.153 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Okay, "The
Midnight Sun," here we go.

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:20.458 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music]
Paint something pastoral

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:31.402 align:middle line:84%
with a waterfall and
trees bending in the wind.

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:33.972 align:middle line:90%
Please paint something cool.

00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:38.543 align:middle line:90%
Don't paint the sun anymore!

00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Don't paint the sun
anymore [crying]!

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:48.753 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:51.055 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Where did he
get some of these actresses

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:52.423 align:middle line:90%
and actors at the time?

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Not the newly up-and-coming
ones...

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:34:56.127 --> 00:34:57.195 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...but I mean...

00:34:57.195 --> 00:34:58.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah,
Betty Garde, yeah.

00:34:58.329 --> 00:34:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...established people like that.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Amazing.

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:01.166 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know his casting
people were very, very good,

00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:02.567 align:middle line:90%
and so they were getting actors

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:05.603 align:middle line:84%
who were very famous movie
stars, like Ida Lupino and --

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:07.539 align:middle line:84%
and people who had already
been part of the Golden Age

00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:10.275 align:middle line:84%
of Hollywood, Howard Duff,
those kind of people, but --

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:12.243 align:middle line:84%
but then they were also
looking for young up-and-comers,

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:13.645 align:middle line:84%
so they were getting
the best of both.

00:35:13.645 --> 00:35:15.747 align:middle line:84%
So for instance Lois Nettleton
is the young actress in that,

00:35:15.747 --> 00:35:17.882 align:middle line:84%
and she'd been doing
TV at that time.

00:35:17.882 --> 00:35:20.051 align:middle line:84%
You know, as you mentioned
Jack Klugman, Ross Martin.

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:21.186 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Hmm-mm.

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:22.554 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: There
were some great actors.

00:35:22.554 --> 00:35:23.488 align:middle line:84%
Lee Marvin, my God, he was
terrific in  Twilight Zone .

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:24.489 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Burgess Meredith.

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:25.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Burgess
Meredith, yes.

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:26.224 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Classic.

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:27.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
Burgess Meredith

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:28.860 align:middle line:84%
of course had already been --
been a well-known star in films

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.428 align:middle line:84%
with  Of Mice and
Men , films like that.

00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:31.396 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:35:31.396 --> 00:35:32.497 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: But
of course he --

00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:33.631 align:middle line:84%
he was phenomenal
in  Twilight Zone .

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:35.033 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: People
like Burgess Meredith,

00:35:35.033 --> 00:35:37.969 align:middle line:84%
was it difficult to get them
to do  Twilight Zone  episodes?

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:40.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: No, because the
-- the reason was, you know,

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:42.407 align:middle line:84%
Rod -- I mean, you can just
see even from these clips,

00:35:42.407 --> 00:35:43.775 align:middle line:90%
the writing is phenomenal.

00:35:43.775 --> 00:35:46.678 align:middle line:84%
And when an actor gets a script
with that kind of writing

00:35:46.678 --> 00:35:48.012 align:middle line:84%
where they can really
dig in and...

00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:48.846 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And have some fun.

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:49.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: ...and say --

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:50.782 align:middle line:84%
well also say something
important...

00:35:50.782 --> 00:35:51.616 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:53.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: ...and truthful.

00:35:53.017 --> 00:35:54.185 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have something
that's meaningful, and truthful,

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:56.521 align:middle line:90%
and poignant -- you know,

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:58.890 align:middle line:84%
when Burgess Meredith plays
the last man on earth,

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.593 align:middle line:84%
the bookworm you know, in "Time
Enough at Last," you know,

00:36:01.593 --> 00:36:03.595 align:middle line:90%
your heart goes out to him.

00:36:03.595 --> 00:36:04.862 align:middle line:90%
And -- and he told me that just

00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:07.599 align:middle line:84%
when you would get these
Serling scripts you --

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:08.967 align:middle line:90%
you'd love to make them.

00:36:08.967 --> 00:36:10.602 align:middle line:84%
There are many actors that --
television could not afford,

00:36:10.602 --> 00:36:12.971 align:middle line:84%
people like Robert Cummings who
was a movie star at the time,

00:36:12.971 --> 00:36:14.339 align:middle line:84%
and -- but they --
they jumped in,

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:15.707 align:middle line:90%
and they'd do  Twilight Zone

00:36:15.707 --> 00:36:17.875 align:middle line:84%
because they would get these
phenomenal scripts to star in.

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:19.711 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Died
at 50, way too...

00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:20.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:21.546 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: ...young.

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:22.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah,
heart -- heart --

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:24.048 align:middle line:84%
it was complications
from open heart surgery.

00:36:24.048 --> 00:36:25.783 align:middle line:84%
Rod was a chain smoker, and he'd
kind of bottle up his emotions.

00:36:25.783 --> 00:36:27.018 align:middle line:84%
He felt so strongly
about things.

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:28.386 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:29.988 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And his dad died
at 52 of heart attack, so --

00:36:29.988 --> 00:36:31.289 align:middle line:84%
so there was -- there
were a lot of factors.

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:33.224 align:middle line:84%
His brother, Bob Serling,
told me that it was

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:35.426 align:middle line:84%
like a plane crash where there's
never -- only one reason.

00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:37.629 align:middle line:84%
There's a multiplicity of
reasons that come together

00:36:37.629 --> 00:36:39.831 align:middle line:84%
at one point to have
a disaster happen.

00:36:39.831 --> 00:36:41.933 align:middle line:84%
And yet -- and yet, you
know, Rod only lived to 50,

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:43.167 align:middle line:90%
but my God what he packed in --

00:36:43.167 --> 00:36:45.603 align:middle line:84%
the body of work he
created is just amazing.

00:36:45.603 --> 00:36:46.304 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Phenomenal.

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:47.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:36:47.272 --> 00:36:48.273 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
His daughter told me

00:36:48.273 --> 00:36:50.441 align:middle line:90%
that he sold the rights off.

00:36:50.441 --> 00:36:50.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:52.176 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:52.844 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: The family
could have made a fortune

00:36:52.844 --> 00:36:54.112 align:middle line:90%
on that, huh?

00:36:54.112 --> 00:36:55.113 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Back then
in those days the creator

00:36:55.113 --> 00:36:56.281 align:middle line:84%
of a show would often
own the show,

00:36:56.281 --> 00:36:57.649 align:middle line:90%
and Rod owned  Twilight Zone ,

00:36:57.649 --> 00:36:59.117 align:middle line:84%
and CBS when they canceled
the show, they said,

00:36:59.117 --> 00:37:00.218 align:middle line:90%
"Well, this was over budget.

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:01.419 align:middle line:84%
We're never going to
make much of a profit."

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:03.955 align:middle line:84%
So he sold it to them for
a million bucks, and --

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:05.156 align:middle line:84%
which was a lot back
then, but --

00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:06.991 align:middle line:84%
and then they immediately
turned --

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:08.559 align:middle line:84%
turned around and
sold it worldwide,

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:11.796 align:middle line:84%
and they're making an enormous
amount of money to this day.

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:13.831 align:middle line:84%
And Rod realized immediately
he made a terrible mistake.

00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:15.733 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "That was the
dumbest thing I ever did."

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:17.902 align:middle line:84%
And -- but he retained
the publishing rights

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:20.071 align:middle line:84%
and adaptation rights,
so, you know, he was --

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.173 align:middle line:84%
he was still the most successful
writer working in TV, and --

00:37:22.173 --> 00:37:24.208 align:middle line:84%
and at the time he was
also doing commercials,

00:37:24.208 --> 00:37:25.176 align:middle line:90%
voiceovers in commercials...

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:26.144 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:27.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...so
he wasn't --

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:28.313 align:middle line:84%
he didn't end up on a
street corner, you know,

00:37:28.313 --> 00:37:29.147 align:middle line:90%
with a cup [laughter].

00:37:29.147 --> 00:37:30.448 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: The music...

00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:31.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:32.216 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...was a great tune.

00:37:32.216 --> 00:37:33.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes, my God.

00:37:33.151 --> 00:37:34.519 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
How'd that happen?

00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:35.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, the top
-- the top composers, again.

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:38.122 align:middle line:84%
You have Bernard Hermann who
did  Psycho  and  Citizen Kane ,

00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:39.590 align:middle line:90%
and Jerry Goldsmith who did --

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.159 align:middle line:84%
you know, one of the
great composers of --

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:42.460 align:middle line:84%
of cinema with  Planet
of the Apes

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.829 align:middle line:84%
and many other great
scores,  Chinatown .

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:49.167 align:middle line:84%
And when you get a script that's
terrific everyone else rises

00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:50.568 align:middle line:90%
to the challenge.

00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:51.969 align:middle line:84%
They try and do their best work,
and so if you look at an episode

00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:55.139 align:middle line:84%
like "Walking Distance" which
has a Bernard Hermann score it's

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:56.941 align:middle line:84%
as good as -- as anything
Bernard Hermann did

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:57.642 align:middle line:90%
in -- in film.

00:37:57.642 --> 00:37:59.043 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's superb.

00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:00.678 align:middle line:84%
And -- and you listen
to the motifs

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:02.914 align:middle line:84%
that he's composing
for that score...

00:38:02.914 --> 00:38:04.048 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Hmm-mm.

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:05.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...and
then you watch a movie

00:38:05.183 --> 00:38:06.584 align:middle line:84%
like  Fahrenheit 451
that he also scored,

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:07.852 align:middle line:84%
and you see that he's -- he's
exploring the themes that he --

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:09.387 align:middle line:84%
that he then takes
into his features.

00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:12.390 align:middle line:84%
But -- but everyone felt
so honored to be working

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.759 align:middle line:84%
on  Twilight Zone ; they
felt there was a gift given

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:15.827 align:middle line:90%
to them to be part of this.

00:38:15.827 --> 00:38:16.561 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
I agree with that.

00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:17.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Hmm-mm.

00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:18.496 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's have
some questions for Mark.

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:20.698 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir. Right here.

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:24.769 align:middle line:84%
>>  Twilight Zone  was just
amazing on many levels.

00:38:24.769 --> 00:38:26.104 align:middle line:90%
What do you like today?

00:38:26.104 --> 00:38:28.673 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
contemporary that is going

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:30.408 align:middle line:90%
to withstand the same time?

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:31.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:32.977 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're going to be
talking about 50 years from now?

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well,
it's hard --

00:38:34.212 --> 00:38:35.913 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to predict what's
going to happen 50 years

00:38:35.913 --> 00:38:38.649 align:middle line:84%
from now, and -- you know,
it's -- you -- you never know.

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.952 align:middle line:84%
But -- but the things that
I find meaningful and things

00:38:40.952 --> 00:38:42.053 align:middle line:90%
that I find entertaining, I --

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:43.454 align:middle line:84%
I like the recent
Battlestar Galactica .

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:44.655 align:middle line:90%
It was very dark.

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:47.225 align:middle line:84%
I watch  Game of
Thrones , which I've worked

00:38:47.225 --> 00:38:49.093 align:middle line:84%
with George R. R. Martin
on several series, and --

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:51.229 align:middle line:84%
and I think he's a
very talented writer.

00:38:51.229 --> 00:38:53.131 align:middle line:84%
And again, they go toward
darkness; they go --

00:38:53.131 --> 00:38:55.700 align:middle line:84%
go toward -- you know,
the ultimate message seems

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.101 align:middle line:90%
to be one of hopelessness.

00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:58.669 align:middle line:90%
And in my own work now I'm --

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:00.671 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing something that's a
hopeful vision of the future.

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:02.874 align:middle line:84%
It's -- it's called  Space
Command , just because I want

00:39:02.874 --> 00:39:04.242 align:middle line:84%
to have something
that like  Star Trek ,

00:39:04.242 --> 00:39:06.344 align:middle line:84%
like  Twilight Zone
presents hope.

00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:08.846 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, I know from
my own life, and the life

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:11.449 align:middle line:84%
of my friends, and those I care
about, and those I've seen,

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:13.951 align:middle line:84%
that people can ban together
and create something stronger.

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:16.387 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the power
of love and compassion.

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:18.189 align:middle line:90%
And so in terms of what --

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:20.491 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what films
and TV shows will last,

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:23.428 align:middle line:84%
we all have our own favorites,
but -- but for me I --

00:39:23.428 --> 00:39:26.597 align:middle line:84%
I like things that I can take
away something that allows me

00:39:26.597 --> 00:39:28.232 align:middle line:84%
to grow and be a better
person in the world.

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:30.368 align:middle line:84%
So that's what -- that's what
really works for me the best.

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.302 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I like shows

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:32.703 align:middle line:84%
that have good endings,
don't you?

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:34.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes, yes, I do.

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:37.241 align:middle line:84%
I do. And -- well, you know it's
funny because you know we --

00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:38.476 align:middle line:84%
all of us who work
in film and TV,

00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:40.211 align:middle line:90%
we recognize kindred spirits.

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:41.612 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And that's why
you and I hit it off so much,

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.848 align:middle line:84%
George, because you're coming
from such a great place

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and such a truthful,
authentic place.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.819 align:middle line:84%
And -- and a lot of people who
are running shows like Ron Moore

00:39:47.819 --> 00:39:51.089 align:middle line:84%
with  Battlestar Galactica ,
or, you know, Rockne O'Bannon

00:39:51.089 --> 00:39:52.590 align:middle line:84%
who recently did
Defiance  and  Cult ;

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.891 align:middle line:90%
now he's on  Revolution .

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:55.226 align:middle line:84%
You know we -- we all
kind of get together,

00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:57.028 align:middle line:84%
and we all know each other
and talk about shows and talk

00:39:57.028 --> 00:39:58.729 align:middle line:84%
about what we want to
do with television.

00:39:58.729 --> 00:39:59.831 align:middle line:90%
It's such a powerful medium.

00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:01.299 align:middle line:84%
You can reach millions
of people.

00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:05.236 align:middle line:84%
We -- all of us, feel a
great obligation to define

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:07.338 align:middle line:84%
at least some -- some
form of emotional truth,

00:40:07.338 --> 00:40:08.639 align:middle line:90%
and I think that's great.

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:10.041 align:middle line:90%
I think if Rod were --

00:40:10.041 --> 00:40:12.376 align:middle line:84%
Rod Serling were writing today
he would find television a much

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:13.911 align:middle line:90%
more welcoming environment.

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:15.646 align:middle line:84%
He'd be writing I'm
sure for HBO or one

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:16.647 align:middle line:90%
of those places, AMC perhaps.

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:17.715 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Hmm.

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:18.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: You
know, Matthew Weiner

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:22.353 align:middle line:84%
who creates  Mad Men ,
he's a huge Serling fan,

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:23.754 align:middle line:90%
as is J.J. Abrams, of course.

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:25.123 align:middle line:90%
I mean, all of us are.

00:40:25.123 --> 00:40:28.025 align:middle line:84%
And -- because Rod -- Rod was
sort of the first one to go

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:29.894 align:middle line:84%
down the tunnel and
light the way for us.

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:31.829 align:middle line:84%
And -- and he said,
"You know there's --

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:33.231 align:middle line:84%
there's something
wonderful to be found."

00:40:33.231 --> 00:40:35.766 align:middle line:84%
And we all take that very
much to heart, all of us.

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:36.467 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
He paved the way.

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:37.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:40:37.602 --> 00:40:38.669 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's
take another look at one

00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:41.272 align:middle line:84%
of our  Beyond Belief
cam questions.

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:42.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Marc.

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:44.308 align:middle line:84%
I'm calling from the
Big Island of Hawaii.

00:40:44.308 --> 00:40:47.178 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to know what it was
like working with George Takei.

00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:49.013 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: [Laughter].

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:49.947 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
you did work with...

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:50.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: I did.

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:51.516 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...George Takei.

00:40:51.516 --> 00:40:52.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: I did.

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:53.818 align:middle line:84%
George Takei is a
great guy to work with,

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:55.086 align:middle line:84%
but the fun part is although
I wrote for  Star Trek:

00:40:55.086 --> 00:40:56.521 align:middle line:84%
The Next Generation ,
and  Deep Space Nine ,

00:40:56.521 --> 00:40:58.089 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of science
fiction shows.

00:40:58.089 --> 00:40:59.624 align:middle line:90%
I found out there were a group

00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:01.592 align:middle line:84%
of  Star Trek  fans making their
own  Star Trek  episodes online,

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:03.227 align:middle line:84%
and they were getting
more viewers

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:05.897 align:middle line:84%
than  Enterprise  was
getting on UPN, and I realized

00:41:05.897 --> 00:41:07.198 align:middle line:84%
that the Internet
had changed things

00:41:07.198 --> 00:41:08.366 align:middle line:84%
where you could actually
reach a --

00:41:08.366 --> 00:41:11.602 align:middle line:84%
a massive audience without
a studio or network.

00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:14.438 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine had -- had
come up with this great idea

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:17.008 align:middle line:90%
for a Sulu story years ago.

00:41:17.008 --> 00:41:18.609 align:middle line:84%
Paramount was going to
bring back  Star Trek

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:19.577 align:middle line:90%
in the '70s, and they got...

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:20.978 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:22.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...the entire
cast except for Leonard Nemoy.

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.114 align:middle line:84%
They were going to do
something called...

00:41:23.114 --> 00:41:23.814 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
had to have Nemoy.

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:25.149 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:26.417 align:middle line:84%
But they were going to do
something called  Star Trek:

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:27.251 align:middle line:84%
Phase Two , and they
spent a year buying scripts

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:28.419 align:middle line:90%
and building sets, and a friend

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:29.987 align:middle line:84%
of mine pitched this
great Sulu story to them.

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And -- but then  Star Wars
came out, and  Star Trek  was --

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.692 align:middle line:84%
the decided to make the
Star Trek  movies instead

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:35.993 align:middle line:84%
of the TV show, so
they pulled the plug.

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:37.695 align:middle line:84%
But I remember that
story, and I --

00:41:37.695 --> 00:41:39.330 align:middle line:90%
and I thought it'd be fun to --

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:40.831 align:middle line:90%
to team up with these fans

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:43.501 align:middle line:84%
who had built all the original
Star Trek  sets over again,

00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:84%
the Enterprise bridge, all
that stuff, and build a team

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.906 align:middle line:84%
from Hollywood and make
a new  Star Trek  episode

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:50.174 align:middle line:90%
with George Takei.

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:52.276 align:middle line:84%
So I -- I went to George's
house; I sat down with him

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:53.945 align:middle line:84%
in his dining room, and I
said, "Here's the storyline."

00:41:53.945 --> 00:41:56.147 align:middle line:84%
And I gave him three pages of
what the script was going to be,

00:41:56.147 --> 00:41:57.381 align:middle line:90%
and I said, "This is the --

00:41:57.381 --> 00:42:00.117 align:middle line:84%
this is the Sulu episode
you deserved but never got."

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:01.953 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I need you
to tell me right now

00:42:01.953 --> 00:42:03.221 align:middle line:90%
if you're going to do it."

00:42:03.221 --> 00:42:04.622 align:middle line:84%
And he -- he read it, and
he said, "I'm -- I'm in."

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:08.125 align:middle line:84%
So we spent six months building
the team; we shot 12 days here

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:10.795 align:middle line:84%
in -- in -- well, in LA
and in New York, and --

00:42:10.795 --> 00:42:12.597 align:middle line:90%
and a year of post-production.

00:42:12.597 --> 00:42:14.599 align:middle line:84%
And it was called
"World Enough in Time."

00:42:14.599 --> 00:42:16.968 align:middle line:84%
And -- and you can go online and
actually watch the entire thing,

00:42:16.968 --> 00:42:18.669 align:middle line:84%
or go to my Website
marczicree.com

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:20.237 align:middle line:90%
and watch the entire episode.

00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:22.907 align:middle line:84%
And I'm prouder of that than
anything I did for the networks.

00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:25.309 align:middle line:84%
And it was nominated
for the Hugo Nebula,

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:26.577 align:middle line:84%
which are the top awards
in science fiction.

00:42:26.577 --> 00:42:27.511 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's right.

00:42:27.511 --> 00:42:28.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: So
it was -- but --

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:30.648 align:middle line:84%
but just to answer the question
in terms of George Takei,

00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:32.783 align:middle line:84%
he's the most professional
actor I've ever worked with.

00:42:32.783 --> 00:42:36.687 align:middle line:84%
He's brilliant; he's wonderful;
he's a phenomenal actor.

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:39.790 align:middle line:84%
He's -- he's just -- he was --
it was just such an honor...

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:40.725 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Each...

00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:41.826 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...such
an honor.

00:42:41.826 --> 00:42:43.160 align:middle line:84%
My God, he's just --
well, he lost 15 pounds

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.595 align:middle line:84%
and was working out,
lifting weights to get

00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:46.097 align:middle line:90%
in shape for the role.

00:42:46.097 --> 00:42:47.231 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.599 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And he's
just doing sword fights

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:51.202 align:middle line:84%
and all this stuff, and it was
just -- I mean, there was --

00:42:51.202 --> 00:42:54.171 align:middle line:84%
he was just a total pro; never a
moment of complaint; never a --

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.540 align:middle line:84%
never any attitude;
a dream come true.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.708 align:middle line:90%
I long to work with him again.

00:42:57.708 --> 00:42:58.709 align:middle line:84%
I hope we get to
work with him again.

00:42:58.709 --> 00:42:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Super.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:00.478 align:middle line:90%
How about another question?

00:43:00.478 --> 00:43:01.512 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:02.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks for taking
my question, Marc.

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:04.248 align:middle line:90%
Kind of a two-part question.

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:07.385 align:middle line:84%
One, who's been in
more episodes --

00:43:07.385 --> 00:43:10.688 align:middle line:84%
any actor who's been in more
episodes than any other one?

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:14.592 align:middle line:84%
And who -- was there anybody
that Rod wouldn't work with?

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: [Laughter]
That's an interesting

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:16.427 align:middle line:90%
question [laughter].

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.762 align:middle line:90%
Those are great.

00:43:17.762 --> 00:43:20.631 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of -- of supporting
actors there was a guy --

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:22.466 align:middle line:84%
a guy named Vaughn Taylor
who was in a lot of episodes.

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of leads, Burgess
Meredith and Jack Klugman tie.

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.838 align:middle line:84%
They were each in four
episodes, and they're...

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:28.673 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's a lot.

00:43:28.673 --> 00:43:29.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: ...brilliant --

00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:30.308 align:middle line:84%
they're brilliant
in all of them.

00:43:30.308 --> 00:43:31.242 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:43:31.242 --> 00:43:32.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: In
terms of actors

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:33.511 align:middle line:84%
that Serling wouldn't
work with, you know, he --

00:43:33.511 --> 00:43:35.646 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he had various
people that he --

00:43:35.646 --> 00:43:37.848 align:middle line:84%
that were a little
bit high-strung,

00:43:37.848 --> 00:43:40.317 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps an actor that
he did work with who proved

00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:42.153 align:middle line:84%
to be a little bit
of a handful was --

00:43:42.153 --> 00:43:46.057 align:middle line:84%
there's an episode called "The
Silence," and there was a --

00:43:46.057 --> 00:43:48.626 align:middle line:84%
a movie star named Franchot Tone
who had been in a lot of movies

00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:51.195 align:middle line:84%
in the '30s and '40s, and
now he's an older actor,

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:52.229 align:middle line:90%
but still very, very good.

00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:54.265 align:middle line:84%
And they hired him
-- it's about a guy

00:43:54.265 --> 00:43:56.200 align:middle line:84%
who takes a bet not
to talk for a year.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.669 align:middle line:84%
And Franchot Tone plays the
guy who challenges this --

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:00.438 align:middle line:84%
this talkative young
man to a bet.

00:44:00.438 --> 00:44:02.273 align:middle line:84%
And so [laughter] they shot
the first day on a Friday,

00:44:02.273 --> 00:44:03.841 align:middle line:84%
and they shot the
beginning and the end

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:05.509 align:middle line:90%
of the episode, and it was fine.

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:08.112 align:middle line:84%
And then Monday they resumed to
shoot the rest of the episode

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:10.581 align:middle line:84%
for the next two days, and
there's no Franchot Tone.

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:12.049 align:middle line:84%
And they have no
idea where he's gone.

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:13.651 align:middle line:84%
And finally they track
him down, and he's in --

00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:15.653 align:middle line:84%
in an emergency room
of a hospital.

00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:17.621 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
was he'd --

00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:19.256 align:middle line:84%
over the weekend he'd
been drinking at --

00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:21.492 align:middle line:84%
at a club, and he'd seen
this attractive young woman,

00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:22.793 align:middle line:90%
and he'd gone to talk to her.

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:24.729 align:middle line:84%
And her boyfriend had
taken umbrage and --

00:44:24.729 --> 00:44:26.897 align:middle line:84%
and had basically
shoved him into the --

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:28.766 align:middle line:84%
in the gravel of the
parking lot, and the --

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:30.601 align:middle line:84%
one side of his face
was scraped raw.

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:31.836 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh, geez.

00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:33.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And so they
said, "Well, come on in,

00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:34.505 align:middle line:90%
and we'll work with it."

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:36.807 align:middle line:84%
So the entire middle
of the episode is --

00:44:36.807 --> 00:44:38.409 align:middle line:84%
they're shooting him
from like the side only,

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:40.778 align:middle line:84%
one side [laughter], or he's
talking from behind a column.

00:44:40.778 --> 00:44:43.214 align:middle line:84%
And -- and he's -- you know, so
they obscure half of his face.

00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:46.083 align:middle line:84%
And the reviews when the
episode came out said it was

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:48.486 align:middle line:84%
such a great artistic touch to
make him seem more malevolent,

00:44:48.486 --> 00:44:49.687 align:middle line:84%
and more [laughter]
creepy, and more villainous

00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:51.455 align:middle line:84%
to have him talking out
of the side of his mouth.

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:52.957 align:middle line:84%
But if you ever watch the
episode again you'll see

00:44:52.957 --> 00:44:54.925 align:middle line:84%
that the beginning and the
end you can see him full-face;

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:56.861 align:middle line:84%
the entire middle you
only see him in profile.

00:44:56.861 --> 00:44:57.561 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You only see...

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:58.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:44:58.395 --> 00:44:59.196 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I love that.

00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:00.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:01.098 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's take
our last video question here

00:45:01.098 --> 00:45:02.133 align:middle line:90%
for you, Marc.

00:45:02.133 --> 00:45:03.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey, this is Elle
from Seattle,

00:45:03.501 --> 00:45:06.337 align:middle line:84%
and I would like to ask Mr.
Zicree what advice would he give

00:45:06.337 --> 00:45:07.838 align:middle line:90%
to start-up directors?

00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:09.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Wow,
that's great.

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:10.207 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:11.208 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know I think...

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:11.909 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Because you mentor...

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:12.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:45:12.877 --> 00:45:14.011 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...a lot of people.

00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:14.712 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: I
mentor a lot -- I mentor.

00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:15.946 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I teach classes,

00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:17.214 align:middle line:84%
and I mentor people
long-distance and also in LA.

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:18.716 align:middle line:84%
And I -- I mentor writers,
and directors, and actors,

00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:21.619 align:middle line:84%
and producers, and you know
it's funny because I --

00:45:21.619 --> 00:45:23.053 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years I've
been a writer-producer,

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:24.121 align:middle line:90%
and now I'm directing, as well.

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:25.489 align:middle line:90%
I'm directing  Space Command

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:27.491 align:middle line:84%
with my wife who's
also a director.

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:29.393 align:middle line:84%
And I've been writing a book
with Guillermo del Toro...

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:30.494 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Hmm-mm.

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:31.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...who's
a terrific director.

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:33.964 align:middle line:84%
And what I would
suggest directors --

00:45:33.964 --> 00:45:36.467 align:middle line:84%
now that you can get HD
cameras so inexpensively...

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:37.868 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's right.

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:38.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...at Best Buy,
and you can edit on a laptop...

00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:40.237 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
they're good quality.

00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:40.938 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: They are;
they're broadcast quality.

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:42.273 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:45:42.273 --> 00:45:43.174 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: You can --
you can get a camera, get a --

00:45:43.174 --> 00:45:44.775 align:middle line:90%
get a laptop, learn how to edit.

00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:47.244 align:middle line:84%
Pull together some actors;
start shooting stuff.

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:48.045 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: [Inaudible].

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:49.113 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Make stuff.

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:50.214 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and -- but also
you know aim high,

00:45:50.214 --> 00:45:51.148 align:middle line:90%
but don't stop yourself.

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:52.183 align:middle line:90%
Get in the action.

00:45:52.183 --> 00:45:53.417 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know
it's -- don't --

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:56.220 align:middle line:84%
you know Ray Bradbury
used to say, "Jump --

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.489 align:middle line:84%
jump off a cliff and build
your wings on the way down."

00:45:58.489 --> 00:45:59.623 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Hmm-mm.

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:00.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And I
strongly believe in that

00:46:00.825 --> 00:46:02.092 align:middle line:84%
because you know being
in the [laughter] fear --

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:03.794 align:middle line:84%
what I would say to
directors is, "Don't worry

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:04.995 align:middle line:90%
about not being good enough.

00:46:04.995 --> 00:46:05.896 align:middle line:90%
Just -- just start.

00:46:05.896 --> 00:46:06.597 align:middle line:90%
Just start."

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:07.298 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Do...

00:46:07.298 --> 00:46:07.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Jump in.

00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know when I --

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.501 align:middle line:84%
when I was starting to write
The Twilight Zone Companion  I

00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:11.769 align:middle line:84%
was worrying about,
"Well, where do I start?

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:12.469 align:middle line:90%
Or how do I start?"

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:13.170 align:middle line:90%
Because I was only 22.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.538 align:middle line:90%
I had never done a book.

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:16.407 align:middle line:84%
And I -- and finally I just
realized I just had to jump in

00:46:16.407 --> 00:46:18.742 align:middle line:84%
and swim for my life [laughter],
and -- and the book came out,

00:46:18.742 --> 00:46:20.811 align:middle line:84%
and it was -- and I
was very proud of it.

00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But -- so you know -- and
the lovely part is because --

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.815 align:middle line:84%
again, because of the
Internet you can make --

00:46:24.815 --> 00:46:27.585 align:middle line:84%
make films or a Web series
anywhere in the world.

00:46:27.585 --> 00:46:32.122 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in -- in Denver,
or Singapore, or Keokuk,

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:34.959 align:middle line:84%
or you know Tasmania,
anywhere, you can make it,

00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:36.026 align:middle line:84%
and you can put it
on the Internet,

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:37.361 align:middle line:84%
and people will see
it the world-round.

00:46:37.361 --> 00:46:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you're being truthful
as a writer, as a director,

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.332 align:middle line:84%
as an actor, people
will respond.

00:46:41.332 --> 00:46:42.533 align:middle line:90%
Good work is recognized.

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:44.602 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And Marc,
talking about creating

00:46:44.602 --> 00:46:45.603 align:middle line:90%
and coming up with new

00:46:45.603 --> 00:46:47.104 align:middle line:84%
and innovative things,
tell me about...

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:47.771 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:46:47.771 --> 00:46:48.405 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: ...

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:49.073 align:middle line:90%
Space Command .

00:46:49.073 --> 00:46:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.075 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes.

00:46:51.075 --> 00:46:52.943 align:middle line:84%
Well,  Space Command  -- well,
this, just to let you know,

00:46:52.943 --> 00:46:57.281 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Noory, this is actually a
real space helmet that was used

00:46:57.281 --> 00:46:59.416 align:middle line:84%
in  The Twilight Zone
episode called "The Parallel,"

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:00.918 align:middle line:84%
so if you ever see
the hour-long episode

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:03.921 align:middle line:84%
"The Parallel" you will see
this wonderful space helmet

00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:04.488 align:middle line:90%
being used.

00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:05.522 align:middle line:90%
And -- and...

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:06.323 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: It's heavy.

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:06.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes, it is.

00:47:06.891 --> 00:47:08.092 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, indeed.

00:47:08.092 --> 00:47:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And so -- we'll put it
back here for -- for now.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:10.895 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Was
this part of a...

00:47:10.895 --> 00:47:11.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:47:11.896 --> 00:47:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...underwater thing?

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:13.764 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: No.

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:15.099 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: [Inaudible].

00:47:15.099 --> 00:47:16.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: It was actually
a Navy high-altitude suit

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:17.501 align:middle line:84%
that was used in -- in
actual high-altitude...

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:18.335 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
With the astronauts?

00:47:18.335 --> 00:47:19.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes, yes, yes.

00:47:19.536 --> 00:47:21.505 align:middle line:84%
And the way I got it was
when I was 13 years old...

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:22.273 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Wow.

00:47:22.273 --> 00:47:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Western --

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.308 align:middle line:90%
Western Costume had a sale

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:26.777 align:middle line:84%
when I was 13 years
old, and my mom took me.

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And they were selling an entire
space suit, this space suit --

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.215 align:middle line:84%
I actually own the
entire space suit.

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:33.684 align:middle line:84%
And my mom bought it
for me for $35.00.

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:34.685 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Look at it.

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:35.552 align:middle line:84%
There's bolts and
things like that.

00:47:35.552 --> 00:47:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Amazing,
amazing.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:37.922 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Little
ear things, and...

00:47:37.922 --> 00:47:38.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: But in
terms of  Space Command  --

00:47:38.822 --> 00:47:40.190 align:middle line:90%
you asked about  Space Command ,

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.159 align:middle line:84%
with the young people I've been
mentoring I've been hearing

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:44.128 align:middle line:84%
about Kickstarter
which is this Website

00:47:44.128 --> 00:47:45.262 align:middle line:90%
where you can raise financing.

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:46.597 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's right.

00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:47.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And I'd never
raised money for anything,

00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:49.500 align:middle line:84%
but I thought, "Well,
let's see what can happen."

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.603 align:middle line:84%
So we set a target of $75,000.00
to raise over two months.

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:54.905 align:middle line:84%
We raised it in just over
three days, and we kept going,

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:57.207 align:middle line:90%
and we raised $221,000.00.

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:59.143 align:middle line:84%
And there's a young director
who I've been mentoring,

00:47:59.143 --> 00:48:01.145 align:middle line:84%
and he actually moved from
Europe for me to mentor him,

00:48:01.145 --> 00:48:03.314 align:middle line:84%
and he's been making low-budget
science fiction movies,

00:48:03.314 --> 00:48:05.983 align:middle line:84%
very high quality in terms
of effects and production.

00:48:05.983 --> 00:48:07.318 align:middle line:90%
And we decided to team up,

00:48:07.318 --> 00:48:09.119 align:middle line:84%
and I created this thing
called  Space Command .

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:11.722 align:middle line:84%
We have our own studio, and I've
written four of the screenplays.

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:12.923 align:middle line:84%
I've -- I have two
more storylines,

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:15.359 align:middle line:84%
and it's this big
story of the future.

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:17.394 align:middle line:90%
It covers 150 years and --

00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:20.431 align:middle line:84%
and several generations of three
families as we go out in space,

00:48:20.431 --> 00:48:22.132 align:middle line:90%
colonize the planets and moons

00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:23.734 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system,
jump to the stars.

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:26.136 align:middle line:84%
It's this big, hopeful
vision of the future.

00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:28.539 align:middle line:84%
And we have our own studio now;
we're in pre-production now.

00:48:28.539 --> 00:48:29.907 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
shooting several

00:48:29.907 --> 00:48:31.809 align:middle line:84%
of these films back-to-back,
and I've brought aboard a lot

00:48:31.809 --> 00:48:33.677 align:middle line:84%
of my friends from the
shows I've written for,

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:36.246 align:middle line:84%
so Bob Picardo, Robert
Picardo from  Star Trek:

00:48:36.246 --> 00:48:37.548 align:middle line:84%
Voyager  who played
the holographic doctor.

00:48:37.548 --> 00:48:38.449 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Are
they excited about this?

00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:39.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:41.819 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mira Furlan who was Delenn
in  Babylon 5 , and Doug Jones

00:48:41.819 --> 00:48:43.554 align:middle line:84%
who played Pan in
Pan's Labyrinth .

00:48:43.554 --> 00:48:45.222 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are
thrilled because --

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:47.257 align:middle line:84%
and my friend Iain McCaig
who designed Darth Maul

00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:48.993 align:middle line:84%
and Queen Amidala, he's been
designing our characters,

00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:51.028 align:middle line:84%
and we have effects
guys from  Serenity

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and all these great shows,
Battlestar Galactica .

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.765 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's
just so much fun

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.667 align:middle line:84%
because you can just
create it now.

00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:58.335 align:middle line:84%
It's -- you don't need
millions of dollars anymore.

00:48:58.335 --> 00:48:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
I was going to say,

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:00.971 align:middle line:84%
you do know what you're
doing to Hollywood...

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes [laughter].

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:03.073 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...if you came,
and you're successful at...

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:04.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:05.109 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...a $200,000 budget.

00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.244 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know the...

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:08.779 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: The big
boys will say, "Hmm."

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:10.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, you
know the big boys, you know,

00:49:10.581 --> 00:49:12.549 align:middle line:84%
they're -- they're having to
find new ways of doing things

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:14.551 align:middle line:84%
because for instance even
with  Veronica Mars  --

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:16.954 align:middle line:84%
they just had a Kickstarter
campaign for  Veronica Mars

00:49:16.954 --> 00:49:18.288 align:middle line:90%
and raised $4 million.

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:20.424 align:middle line:84%
I think -- I think what's
going to happen is now instead

00:49:20.424 --> 00:49:21.658 align:middle line:84%
of canceling shows
they'll just go

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:22.793 align:middle line:84%
to the audience and
say, "Hey, guys.

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:24.528 align:middle line:84%
If you want to fund this
we'll keep making it."

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:25.996 align:middle line:84%
I think if they had
this model back

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:26.897 align:middle line:84%
when Rod was doing
Twilight Zone ...

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:28.198 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:49:28.198 --> 00:49:29.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...we'd
still have  Twilight Zone .

00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:30.267 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: He would
have gone to Kickstarter?

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:31.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, yeah.

00:49:31.602 --> 00:49:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, sure because Rod --
you know, the problem with --

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.905 align:middle line:84%
with  Twilight Zone  in terms
of Rod Serling was there were --

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:36.640 align:middle line:84%
as you said there were
only three networks.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.844 align:middle line:84%
So -- so all you had to do was
anger three guys and you were

00:49:40.844 --> 00:49:42.546 align:middle line:84%
out of television, and that's
essentially what happened

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:45.382 align:middle line:84%
with Rod where -- where
they didn't want meaningful

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:46.683 align:middle line:90%
television at that point.

00:49:46.683 --> 00:49:48.919 align:middle line:84%
They wanted, you know empty
shows, and so Rod very --

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:50.154 align:middle line:90%
you know toward the end

00:49:50.154 --> 00:49:51.388 align:middle line:84%
of his life I think the
reason he didn't understand

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:53.223 align:middle line:84%
that he had created
something that would last was

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:56.360 align:middle line:84%
because television was no
longer a welcoming home for him.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.762 align:middle line:84%
So -- but now we don't
need them anymore.

00:49:58.762 --> 00:50:00.464 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, look
what technology has done even

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:01.698 align:middle line:90%
to our show  Beyond Belief ...

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.334 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...for an
Internet-based program now.

00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:05.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:50:05.536 --> 00:50:06.203 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And I
mean who would imagine...

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:07.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:50:07.071 --> 00:50:08.372 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...20 years ago,

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:10.541 align:middle line:84%
me being in the television
business then...

00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:11.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...that
television programs would be

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.012 align:middle line:90%
seen on a computer?

00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:16.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes, and
I think it's wonderful.

00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:18.382 align:middle line:84%
I think it's absolutely
wonderful because you

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:20.851 align:middle line:84%
and I have both been in those
rooms pitching to the networks.

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:23.253 align:middle line:84%
And the audience
knows what it wants;

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:24.988 align:middle line:84%
the audience wants
meaningful things;

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:26.657 align:middle line:90%
the audience wants entertainment

00:50:26.657 --> 00:50:28.058 align:middle line:84%
that isn't just the
same-old, same-old.

00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:29.193 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:50:29.193 --> 00:50:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: A -- I
have a friend of mine

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.228 align:middle line:90%
who runs television shows.

00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:33.163 align:middle line:84%
He's a -- an executive producer,
and -- and when they --

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:34.832 align:middle line:84%
he was talking about one
series that had been greenlit,

00:50:34.832 --> 00:50:37.501 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "I don't know
how they pitched this other

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:39.636 align:middle line:84%
than saying, "You know that
show out that's on ABC?

00:50:39.636 --> 00:50:42.406 align:middle line:84%
We'll make the same show on CBS,
and you know it'll..."" It's

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:44.808 align:middle line:84%
like -- there's so much
cookie-cutter television,

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:46.477 align:middle line:84%
and I think -- and good
shows do get through.

00:50:46.477 --> 00:50:47.211 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean to -- to...

00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:48.278 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...be
negative, but I --

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:52.116 align:middle line:84%
I think it's wonderful now
that if there's an audience,

00:50:52.116 --> 00:50:53.817 align:middle line:84%
if people want to see
something, they now can.

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is going to
just grow, and grow, and grow,

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.021 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so glad that you
now have a TV show, George.

00:50:58.021 --> 00:50:59.423 align:middle line:90%
It -- it warms my heart.

00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:02.426 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, and --
and it's before a live audience,

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:03.527 align:middle line:90%
which is what I enjoy.

00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:04.461 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:05.162 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And it's working.

00:51:05.162 --> 00:51:06.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah.

00:51:06.497 --> 00:51:07.164 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Tell me
about  Space Command , though.

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.232 align:middle line:90%
What is the concept?

00:51:08.232 --> 00:51:09.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: The
concept basically is

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:11.969 align:middle line:84%
that there's a family --
well, it's interesting.

00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:14.404 align:middle line:84%
There's a great -- there's a
great TV show from the live days

00:51:14.404 --> 00:51:17.007 align:middle line:84%
of television called
Space Patrol , and there --

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:18.675 align:middle line:84%
there were other shows,
Tom Corbett, Space Cadet ,

00:51:18.675 --> 00:51:21.145 align:middle line:84%
and various shows,
but I met the actor

00:51:21.145 --> 00:51:22.913 align:middle line:90%
who starred in  Space Patrol .

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:25.015 align:middle line:84%
His name was Ed Kemmer,
and he was --

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:27.985 align:middle line:84%
he had been a hero in World
War II; he flew a P51 Mustang.

00:51:27.985 --> 00:51:29.987 align:middle line:84%
He was shot down; he
escaped the POW camp,

00:51:29.987 --> 00:51:31.889 align:middle line:84%
an amazing man, an
amazing actor.

00:51:31.889 --> 00:51:34.324 align:middle line:84%
He played this heroic
character, and that led directly

00:51:34.324 --> 00:51:35.459 align:middle line:84%
to  Star Trek , and
it was this --

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:37.194 align:middle line:84%
very much it was
a hopeful vision,

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:39.463 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it would be so
interesting to have a family --

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:41.398 align:middle line:84%
and I've named the main
character after Ed Kemmer...

00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:42.766 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:43.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...so you've
got -- you've got Jack Kemmer,

00:51:43.901 --> 00:51:44.601 align:middle line:84%
and his son Matt Kemmer,
and so forth [laughter],

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:45.903 align:middle line:90%
over five generations.

00:51:45.903 --> 00:51:47.905 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it would be so
interesting to do a future

00:51:47.905 --> 00:51:48.939 align:middle line:84%
where they're in
Space Command ;

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.207 align:middle line:84%
there's actually a
real Space Command.

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:52.709 align:middle line:84%
It's a -- it's the space
going branch of the Air Force.

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:54.678 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it would be very
interesting to extrapolate that,

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:56.346 align:middle line:90%
and Space Command out --

00:51:56.346 --> 00:51:59.283 align:middle line:84%
you know, so that our story
starts 60 years from now,

00:51:59.283 --> 00:52:01.318 align:middle line:90%
and then we continue out.

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:05.622 align:middle line:84%
And it's about how this family
deals with the challenges

00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:07.024 align:middle line:90%
of going out into space.

00:52:07.024 --> 00:52:08.992 align:middle line:84%
And it's about -- and we have
different kinds of characters.

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:11.028 align:middle line:84%
There's a -- the
Sekander family;

00:52:11.028 --> 00:52:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Bob Picardo plays the
patriarch of that family.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:17.634 align:middle line:84%
Mira Furlan plays an
archeologist named Vaughn O'dara

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:19.036 align:middle line:90%
[assumed spelling].

00:52:19.036 --> 00:52:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So they're -- they're facing the
challenges, and we're dealing

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:22.139 align:middle line:84%
with androids, and we have
androids, and we have aliens,

00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:25.042 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of fun things
that we love in science fiction,

00:52:25.042 --> 00:52:27.611 align:middle line:84%
but again, I'm looking at
stories that speak to the heart.

00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And one -- and I'm bringing sort
of my own family story into it

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.949 align:middle line:84%
because I'm very interested
in the domino effect

00:52:31.949 --> 00:52:34.418 align:middle line:84%
from generation to
generation because my dad --

00:52:34.418 --> 00:52:37.888 align:middle line:84%
okay, before my father was born
his father abandoned the family,

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:39.089 align:middle line:90%
so I never met my grandfather.

00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:40.157 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Ah.

00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:40.991 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
I never saw a photo

00:52:40.991 --> 00:52:41.858 align:middle line:90%
of my grandfather until I was...

00:52:41.858 --> 00:52:42.659 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
That's not easy.

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:43.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: ...an adult.

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:44.761 align:middle line:84%
And so -- so I found
out ultimately

00:52:44.761 --> 00:52:45.762 align:middle line:84%
when  The Twilight
Zone Companion  came

00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:47.197 align:middle line:84%
out someone saw my
name on the book,

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:49.700 align:middle line:84%
and they were a distant
relative, and they contacted me.

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.468 align:middle line:84%
And they have -- they have the
Zicree family tree going back

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:52.603 align:middle line:90%
to the 17th century.

00:52:52.603 --> 00:52:53.837 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Whoa!

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:55.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And this
woman had known my granddad.

00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:56.907 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that my
grandfather, Ernest Zicree,

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:58.342 align:middle line:90%
had had two vocations.

00:52:58.342 --> 00:53:01.511 align:middle line:84%
He was a professional chef and
a professional criminal, okay.

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:02.546 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
he once said --

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.715 align:middle line:84%
he once said to a family member,
"I've done a lot of things

00:53:04.715 --> 00:53:06.049 align:middle line:90%
that I'm -- I'm not proud of,

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:07.618 align:middle line:84%
but never under the
name Zicree."

00:53:07.618 --> 00:53:11.188 align:middle line:84%
So [laughter] -- so I was very
interested in sort of this --

00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:12.823 align:middle line:84%
this domino effect from
generation to generation...

00:53:12.823 --> 00:53:14.057 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:15.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: So my father
had to deal with that,

00:53:15.259 --> 00:53:16.493 align:middle line:84%
and then I dealt with what
my father went through.

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:19.463 align:middle line:84%
And so the Kemmer family
and Sekander family,

00:53:19.463 --> 00:53:21.098 align:middle line:84%
they sort of are in
opposition sometimes;

00:53:21.098 --> 00:53:22.699 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they're allies;
sometimes they're enemies.

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:25.569 align:middle line:84%
It's this big story about
history on a broad canvas,

00:53:25.569 --> 00:53:28.772 align:middle line:84%
but told through the lens of
these individual characters.

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:31.141 align:middle line:84%
So -- so it's been fascinating
to -- to write, and --

00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:33.043 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of very
interesting relationships,

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:35.979 align:middle line:84%
and I was also interested in
going against stereotypes.

00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:37.347 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance,
Bob Picardo's going

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:39.750 align:middle line:84%
to play a Muslim
named Yusef Sekander.

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:41.151 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Hmm-mm.

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And I -- I have
a friend who's from Afghanistan,

00:53:42.452 --> 00:53:44.354 align:middle line:84%
and I -- and he's a Muslim;
he's a -- he's a good guy,

00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:46.223 align:middle line:84%
but he's not a good guy
because he's a Muslim,

00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:47.357 align:middle line:90%
or he wouldn't be a bad guy...

00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:48.725 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: He's
just a good human being.

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:49.426 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: He's just a
good guy, and he -- and he's --

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:50.627 align:middle line:90%
happens to be a Muslim.

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:52.462 align:middle line:84%
And I'm -- and Mira
Furlan -- it's fascinating,

00:53:52.462 --> 00:53:54.498 align:middle line:84%
I met a young actress named
Yulana Merchda [assumed

00:53:54.498 --> 00:53:56.466 align:middle line:84%
spelling], and she
speaks Serbo-Croatian;

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:57.768 align:middle line:84%
she's from the former
Yugoslavia.

00:53:57.768 --> 00:53:59.603 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered that Mira,
when I worked with her

00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:01.938 align:middle line:84%
on  Babylon 5 , she
spoke Serbo-Croatian.

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it'd be great
to cast them as mother

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.442 align:middle line:84%
and daughter, and when
they're on a spaceship alone

00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:07.177 align:middle line:84%
with each other they
speak Serbo-Croatian.

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:08.245 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:09.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: But
when they're talking

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:10.547 align:middle line:84%
to everyone else
they talk English,

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.648 align:middle line:84%
because of course there will
be foreign languages in space.

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:14.484 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just kind
of exploring our world,

00:54:14.484 --> 00:54:16.320 align:middle line:84%
but just extrapolating
it further.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.822 align:middle line:84%
And -- and it's just --
it's just a dream come true.

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Now --
now, and what will your --

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:21.458 align:middle line:90%
what will the venue be?

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:22.693 align:middle line:84%
Where will we be
able to see this?

00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:23.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: That's a
very interesting question.

00:54:23.827 --> 00:54:26.163 align:middle line:84%
It will be DVD, Blu-Ray,
downloadable content.

00:54:26.163 --> 00:54:29.132 align:middle line:84%
But, again, you know I'm not
averse to networks and studios.

00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:31.435 align:middle line:84%
So once we start shooting, once
we have something we can show...

00:54:31.435 --> 00:54:32.235 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:33.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: ...I can --

00:54:33.537 --> 00:54:34.905 align:middle line:84%
a lot of my friends who are
running network shows are

00:54:34.905 --> 00:54:36.540 align:middle line:84%
saying, "Well, we'd like to
walk this into the networks."

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.941 align:middle line:90%
I am not doing it at this stage

00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:40.010 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want anyone
dictating what I'm doing.

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:41.345 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
What to do, right.

00:54:41.345 --> 00:54:42.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Because, for
instance, with Mira Furlan,

00:54:42.446 --> 00:54:43.714 align:middle line:84%
Bob Picardo, all these
actors, I don't have

00:54:43.714 --> 00:54:44.982 align:middle line:90%
to get anyone's permission.

00:54:44.982 --> 00:54:46.616 align:middle line:84%
I can just reach out to
actors because they're great.

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:47.417 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:48.618 align:middle line:90%
Cut a deal with them and...

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:49.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well,
Doug Jones who played Pan

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:50.554 align:middle line:90%
in  Pan's Labyrinth , he's going

00:54:50.554 --> 00:54:52.255 align:middle line:84%
to be playing what
we call a synthetic.

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:54.124 align:middle line:84%
It's like a -- a
replicant, an android,

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.225 align:middle line:84%
and his name is Dor
Nevin [assumed spelling],

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:57.394 align:middle line:90%
and he leads a revolt, and --

00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:59.830 align:middle line:84%
but basically he's going
to be very long-lived.

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.331 align:middle line:84%
So he and Mira Furlan
who's got --

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:04.334 align:middle line:84%
who's been genetically altered
to be basically immortal,

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:06.103 align:middle line:84%
they're going to cover
the entire 150 years

00:55:06.103 --> 00:55:06.903 align:middle line:90%
of that storyline.

00:55:06.903 --> 00:55:08.105 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I love it.

00:55:08.105 --> 00:55:08.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Whereas
other characters will age,

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:09.906 align:middle line:90%
and die, and pass on.

00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:10.607 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Could
you have done this,

00:55:10.607 --> 00:55:11.508 align:middle line:90%
Marc, without computers?

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:12.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: No.

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:13.677 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: No
computer [inaudible]?

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:14.511 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: No,
we -- I couldn't...

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:15.345 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: There's no way.

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:16.313 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: We could have...

00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:17.347 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Not on this budget.

00:55:17.347 --> 00:55:18.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Not
without computers,

00:55:18.515 --> 00:55:19.850 align:middle line:84%
not without digital
cameras, and certainly not

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:20.650 align:middle line:84%
without the Internet where I
can have -- my effects team,

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:21.585 align:middle line:90%
some of them are in Germany;

00:55:21.585 --> 00:55:22.819 align:middle line:84%
some are in Spain;
some are here.

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.087 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a world --
we're building a team of --

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:27.124 align:middle line:84%
of world artists to help
us make this come true.

00:55:27.124 --> 00:55:29.693 align:middle line:84%
And -- and now because of Skype,
because of all these things,

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.561 align:middle line:84%
I can communicate
with people directly.

00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:32.662 align:middle line:90%
It would not be possible.

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:34.064 align:middle line:84%
And -- in the old --
and, for instance,

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:37.300 align:middle line:84%
an hour of network television --
network drama, costs between two

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.436 align:middle line:90%
and $5 million per hour.

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:42.272 align:middle line:84%
And even when I was producing
Sliders  it was 1.3 million

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:43.573 align:middle line:90%
per episode.

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:44.274 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, but
how can you do a full-length

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:45.442 align:middle line:90%
computerized movie...

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:46.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.678 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...with actors
and actresses for $200,000.00?

00:55:48.678 --> 00:55:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, the way...

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:50.447 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
you may grab a couple

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:51.848 align:middle line:90%
out of that, right?

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.083 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Well, first of
all I'm not drawing a salary,

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:55.585 align:middle line:84%
so if this thing is popular
and successful I'll --

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.554 align:middle line:84%
I'll benefit, but I'm doing
it because I want to do it.

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:58.455 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing it for the love of it.

00:55:58.455 --> 00:55:59.556 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:00.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: But
-- but more than that,

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:02.692 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of helping hands.

00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:05.262 align:middle line:84%
You know -- you know, it's funny
because you create a community

00:56:05.262 --> 00:56:09.166 align:middle line:84%
of like souls, like spirits,
and -- and when you have that --

00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:10.934 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you another
interesting story.

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:13.603 align:middle line:84%
My brother Jim for many
years worked as a manager

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:15.105 align:middle line:84%
at Home Depot, and one
morning he wakes up,

00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and he decides he
wants meaningful work.

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.607 align:middle line:90%
He wants a meaningful life.

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:18.542 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:19.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: He
quits his job.

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:20.177 align:middle line:90%
Not to disparage Home Depot.

00:56:20.177 --> 00:56:21.478 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: No, not at all.

00:56:21.478 --> 00:56:22.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: But I say
-- so I have lunch with him.

00:56:22.612 --> 00:56:24.414 align:middle line:84%
I say, "You can be part
of anything I'm part of.

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:25.248 align:middle line:90%
You can be a fly on the wall.

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:26.316 align:middle line:90%
I am totally..."

00:56:26.316 --> 00:56:27.017 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You're in.

00:56:27.017 --> 00:56:28.251 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Right.

00:56:28.251 --> 00:56:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So one day Neil Johnson,
the man I'm partnering with,

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.256 align:middle line:84%
is directing two features
back to back under our banner.

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:34.491 align:middle line:90%
They're spaceship movies.

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:35.592 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Hmm-mm.

00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:36.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
he just needed someone

00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:37.894 align:middle line:84%
to help him build sets
for a day for free.

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:38.829 align:middle line:84%
So we call -- put out a
call, and people show up,

00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:40.397 align:middle line:90%
and Jim builds the set.

00:56:40.397 --> 00:56:41.364 align:middle line:90%
Well he was -- had been working

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:42.632 align:middle line:84%
in a hardware store
for 25 years...

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:43.767 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:56:43.767 --> 00:56:44.601 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...so
he knows how to build.

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:45.936 align:middle line:90%
So Neil [laughter] hires him --

00:56:45.936 --> 00:56:47.571 align:middle line:84%
Neil hires Jim, someone who's
never been on a movie set,

00:56:47.571 --> 00:56:48.872 align:middle line:90%
as his Unit Production Manager

00:56:48.872 --> 00:56:50.640 align:middle line:84%
on these two films,
and he loves it.

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.475 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: For free?

00:56:51.475 --> 00:56:52.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: No, for salary.

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh, okay.

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:54.444 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: So he's --
but he's building robots,

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:55.479 align:middle line:84%
and he's building
sets, and he --

00:56:55.479 --> 00:56:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and he buys himself
a digital camera,

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.881 align:middle line:84%
and he buys himself
sound equipment,

00:56:57.881 --> 00:56:58.882 align:middle line:90%
and now he's learning to edit.

00:56:58.882 --> 00:57:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And he's found his calling.

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:01.218 align:middle line:90%
So he's going to be our new...

00:57:01.218 --> 00:57:02.619 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And he loves it.

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:04.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: So he's going to
be our Unit Production Manager

00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:05.021 align:middle line:84%
on  Space Command , and there's
this photo of him under...

00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:05.822 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Good, for you.

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: ...under --

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.958 align:middle line:84%
there's a photo of him under
this robot with this big grin

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:09.326 align:middle line:90%
on his face just happy.

00:57:09.326 --> 00:57:10.093 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:11.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: And so...

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:11.895 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
he wasn't happy before?

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:13.163 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: No, no.

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:14.631 align:middle line:84%
And so to find joy, and to
find meaning in your life,

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:16.032 align:middle line:84%
what better thing
could there be?

00:57:16.032 --> 00:57:18.468 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to impart that
to others, my God, what a gift.

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:21.304 align:middle line:84%
And so in my art and in my life
that's what I strive to do.

00:57:21.304 --> 00:57:22.506 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
What has been for you

00:57:22.506 --> 00:57:25.909 align:middle line:84%
in your career the most
heartwarming thing you've

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:26.710 align:middle line:90%
ever done?

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:28.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Wow, wow.

00:57:28.245 --> 00:57:29.779 align:middle line:84%
That's a -- that's an
interesting question.

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:31.214 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Because
you've touched a lot of lives.

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:32.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: Yeah, you
know, I'll tell you --

00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:34.718 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you one of the most --

00:57:34.718 --> 00:57:36.786 align:middle line:84%
one of the most meaningful
things that ever happened to me,

00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:39.756 align:middle line:84%
a big lesson, was years ago
I was writing a screenplay,

00:57:39.756 --> 00:57:41.658 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want to be
interrupted, so I was writing it

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:42.492 align:middle line:90%
at UCLA in the library.

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:43.527 align:middle line:90%
I graduated from UCLA.

00:57:43.527 --> 00:57:45.695 align:middle line:90%
And this was before cell phones.

00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:47.764 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the day
I would finish my writing,

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and I would go to this
bank of payphones,

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.768 align:middle line:90%
and I would get my messages.

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And there was a girl
on the other phone,

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:55.739 align:middle line:84%
and she was calling friend,
after friend, after friend

00:57:55.739 --> 00:57:58.275 align:middle line:84%
because she had run out of
money, and it was about a --

00:57:58.275 --> 00:57:59.809 align:middle line:84%
a week and a half before the
end of the -- end of the month,

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.711 align:middle line:84%
and she was just asking for
a loan of like a few dollars

00:58:01.711 --> 00:58:02.579 align:middle line:90%
to get through the month.

00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:04.047 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:58:04.047 --> 00:58:05.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And all of her
friends were turning her down,

00:58:05.015 --> 00:58:06.316 align:middle line:84%
so I finished getting
my messages,

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.018 align:middle line:84%
and I took a few steps away,
and I was at a crossroads.

00:58:08.018 --> 00:58:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Or I could either just walk away
as most people normally would...

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:11.655 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:58:11.655 --> 00:58:12.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: ...or I
could do something about it.

00:58:12.722 --> 00:58:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I pulled a
check out of my wallet,

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:16.092 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote her a check for 50
bucks, and I gave it to her.

00:58:16.092 --> 00:58:17.127 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Look..."

00:58:17.127 --> 00:58:17.794 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Oh,
I can't take this."

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:18.895 align:middle line:90%
I said, "No, no, no.

00:58:18.895 --> 00:58:20.964 align:middle line:84%
Pay me back when you
can, and it'll be fine.

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:22.098 align:middle line:90%
It'll be fine.

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:23.466 align:middle line:84%
I've -- I've had
difficulties in my life, and..."

00:58:23.466 --> 00:58:24.134 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Everybody's been there.

00:58:24.134 --> 00:58:25.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Yes.

00:58:25.402 --> 00:58:26.536 align:middle line:84%
And so she took the money,
and my friend said, "Well,

00:58:26.536 --> 00:58:27.904 align:middle line:84%
you're never going to
see that money again."

00:58:27.904 --> 00:58:30.507 align:middle line:84%
So [chuckle] the month ended,
and a few days after the end

00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:33.343 align:middle line:84%
of the month an envelope came
for me, and inside was --

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:35.345 align:middle line:84%
was a check for 50
bucks and a letter

00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:36.713 align:middle line:84%
from this woman saying,
"Thank you.

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:39.516 align:middle line:84%
You've given me back hope in
-- in people, hope in mankind."

00:58:39.516 --> 00:58:40.917 align:middle line:84%
And she'd included
a photo of herself

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:41.952 align:middle line:90%
with her two little girls.

00:58:41.952 --> 00:58:42.986 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Ah!

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:44.054 align:middle line:84%
>> Marc Zicree: And
so she was a mom.

00:58:44.054 --> 00:58:45.689 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Broke
you up, didn't it?

00:58:45.689 --> 00:58:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: And -- yes.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:48.158 align:middle line:84%
And -- and I'd realized
that, my God, how --

00:58:48.158 --> 00:58:51.227 align:middle line:84%
so she had given me the great
gift because I had acted --

00:58:51.227 --> 00:58:53.029 align:middle line:84%
I had heard the better
angels of my nature.

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:55.665 align:middle line:84%
And from then on I knew in my
life that I needed to listen

00:58:55.665 --> 00:58:58.134 align:middle line:84%
to that, and act, and
risk being a fool,

00:58:58.134 --> 00:59:00.136 align:middle line:84%
and risk even being
taken for a ride.

00:59:00.136 --> 00:59:02.205 align:middle line:84%
But to -- to act, and
to reach out to others,

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:04.074 align:middle line:84%
and to make a better
world and better life.

00:59:04.074 --> 00:59:05.609 align:middle line:84%
And certainly this is
what Rod Serling did,

00:59:05.609 --> 00:59:07.243 align:middle line:84%
and certainly this
is what all of us

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:08.645 align:middle line:90%
who come from compassion do.

00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I always tear up when
I tell that story [laughter],

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.582 align:middle line:84%
but -- and recently I
went on the Internet,

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:15.185 align:middle line:84%
and I looked this girl up,
and she's now a professional,

00:59:15.185 --> 00:59:17.687 align:middle line:84%
and her daughters have grown,
and they have careers, and --

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:18.855 align:middle line:90%
and my God, how wonderful.

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:19.689 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: For 50 bucks...

00:59:19.689 --> 00:59:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: For 50 bucks.

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:21.725 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...you
may have changed her life.

00:59:21.725 --> 00:59:22.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: For 50 bucks.

00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:23.259 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Marc Zicree.

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:24.394 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Great.

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:25.161 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Thank
you, Marc [applause].

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:25.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Marc Zicree: Thank you.

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:28.798 align:middle line:90%
[ Applause ]

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:30.433 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I was going
to walk up like Rod Serling

00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:32.936 align:middle line:84%
and do something clever,
but I'll simply say thanks

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:34.404 align:middle line:90%
for watching  Beyond Belief .

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:35.271 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
