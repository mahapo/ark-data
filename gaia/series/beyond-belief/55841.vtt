[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:05.616 --> 00:00:07.622 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.622 --> 00:00:08.830 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.694 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.215 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to this edition

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:10%
Ancient civilizations.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:10%
I've been fascinated with
them, really, all my life.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have an
expert, Jason Martell,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.720 align:middle line:84%
who researches ancient
cultures, ancient civilizations.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things he has
uncovered are quite startling.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Jason, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON MARTELL: Thanks, George.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Always good
seeing you, my friend.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It's a pleasure
to be on your show.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.516 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's new
these days with you?

00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: Well, you
know, for many years

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:10%
I've been talking about planning
some expeditions to some

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:10%
of these more esoteric sites.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.750 align:middle line:10%
And so we're finally starting
to put that into motion

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:10%
through this new venture
called Ancient Explorers.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:10%
And very excited to bring
small groups of people

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:10%
to some of these
exotic locations

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:10%
and deploy some very interesting
technology that's not usually

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.960 align:middle line:10%
in use on a lot of these tours.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're
out on these sites,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.830 align:middle line:84%
isn't it baffling
how they came up

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
with whatever
technology they might

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:90%
have had to do what they did?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Very baffling.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
really what's driving

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
me still today is
most people think

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.720 align:middle line:90%
that ancient man was primitive.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Yet everything we're starting
to find is to the contrary.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:10%
Their ability to
build monuments that

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:10%
aligned to points in space, the
type of architecture that they

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.060 align:middle line:10%
used, mortarless stone
building technology.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, yes, various pieces
of artifacts and things

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:84%
that kind of stick out and
get our attention really

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:84%
just all stir
together and make us

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.130 align:middle line:84%
question our true
origins and our past.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they made these
with architectural accuracy,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
where they can't even put a
razor blade between things.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.425 align:middle line:90%
They're seamless.

00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: They really are.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh!

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: They really are,
and a lot of times people

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
ask what's the overriding
piece of evidence

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
for lost technology
or ancient aliens?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's alien or
not, definitely the term

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
vitrification, exactly
what you're describing,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.510 align:middle line:84%
is somehow ancient man was
heating granite, diorite,

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.919 align:middle line:90%
hardest stones we have on Earth.

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And moving them.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.293 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: And moving them, too.

00:02:33.293 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
But they would make them almost
into like a lava-like state,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and then it would be very easy
to make them pliable and fit

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:84%
in sites like we see like
Machu Picchu and Sacsayhuaman.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:10%
One of Jason's works, of
course, it is called "X Facts."

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:10%
Tell me a little bit
about this, Jason.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.746 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: Sure.

00:02:49.746 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:10%
My book "X Facts, A
Knowledge Apocalypse"

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:10%
is really just kind of a Cliff
Notes to the various ventures

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.517 align:middle line:10%
that I've been looking
into in the 20 years now

00:02:57.517 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:10%
that I've been
exploring these topics.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: A lot of people
are interested in, again,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:90%
firsthand experience.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm really hoping
that we can lead expeditions

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
with people that can
actually come along

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
with us because really a
picture's worth a thousand

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:90%
words.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.321 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:90%
What drives you?

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.110 align:middle line:90%
What got you into this?

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, you know,
when I was in college someone

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
had kind of mentioned a face
on Mars and some other things

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:84%
that-- I was just
a waiter, a surfer,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.930 align:middle line:84%
no interest in any of these
topics about our history.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But I found out that even
though mainstream science has

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
certain views about
our origins, there

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
is a whole alternate set of
information, a new wave of data

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that's coming out, both
science and religion.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I found it
very fascinating

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
to look into the past and
utilize modern technology

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
to merge those two, and
hopefully, get a better

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:90%
compass on where we're going.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is
absolutely stunning

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:84%
when you continue to
investigate this and uncover

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.820 align:middle line:90%
these various aspects.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.112 align:middle line:84%
I remember the story
of the Baghdad Battery.

00:04:03.112 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Right.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.778 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck?

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:90%
It was really a battery.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.835 align:middle line:90%
They used it for something.

00:04:07.835 --> 00:04:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yes.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But what?

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.206 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Yeah,
and that's what--

00:04:11.206 --> 00:04:14.102 align:middle line:84%
you know, mainstream science
kind of presents something

00:04:14.102 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
interesting, but then
there's alternative views

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.510 align:middle line:90%
that are a lot more interesting.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.950 align:middle line:10%
The Baghdad Battery, they
found about a dozen of them

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:10%
in modern day Iraq.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:10%
And it's about a 4-inch tall
device, a clay pot, an iron rod

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:10%
down the center with
a copper lining.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:10%
And if you fill it with any
weak acidic acid, vinegar, grape

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:10%
juice, it actually generates
a positive current.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:10%
Mainstream science
says that ancient man

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:10%
was using it to electroplate
jewelry, like heat

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:10%
up silver or gold
and spray it over.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: That's
interesting enough.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe a light?

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: But right,
there are actual depictions

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egypt in a
crypt called Dendara, which

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.881 align:middle line:84%
is known as the
light-giving source.

00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, it shows
ancient Egyptians holding up

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.857 align:middle line:84%
what appears to be
a large light bulb.

00:04:55.857 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.902 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So if you depict the
bulb and the battery together,

00:04:59.902 --> 00:05:00.735 align:middle line:90%
ancient electricity.

00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Our late friend,
Zecharia Sitchin,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
in his book, of course, "The
Earth Chronicles," mentioned

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle line:84%
in "The 12th Planet"
book that there's

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:84%
another planet in
our solar system

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.255 align:middle line:90%
called Planet X basically.

00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yes.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.497 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nibiru that circles
us every 3,600 years.

00:05:18.497 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: That's correct.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's in that
kind of elliptical orbit.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And he claimed that the
Anunnaki came from that planet,

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:90%
came down here and seeded us.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:84%
You've looked at the theory
of Planet X, haven't you?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: I have.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I spent a little
bit over a decade

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:84%
specifically on just Planet X
and the teachings of Sitchin.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And obviously with any
information or hypothesis,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:90%
things evolve.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin will always be
one of the great people

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
to literally bring to
focus Anunnaki or the term

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Nibiru, that ancient Planet
X. And the search for Planet X

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:84%
is really interesting, George,
because mainstream science

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:84%
keeps putting it
back on the radar.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people that
hear the term Planet X just

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
from Sitchin and become
instantly skeptical and say,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
whoa, this is all mythological
stuff in the past.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Our current sciences
continually are

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
finding extra solar
planets, or brown dwarfs,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
or bodies that are in
some intricate dance

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.266 align:middle line:90%
with our own solar system.

00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And it brings up this
question over and over,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.520 align:middle line:84%
is there a large
body beyond Pluto

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:90%
that we still have to detect?

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And does it meet the criteria
of this ancient Planet X?

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And if it does, maybe there's
people living on that planet.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sitchin read
cuneiforms from ancient Iraq

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:90%
from the Sumerians.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
He interpreted it the
way he felt he did.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.490 align:middle line:84%
But what I find
fascinating about all of it

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.510 align:middle line:84%
is he talked about a
collision between Earth

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and this other planet or
something that was out there.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Today
scientists are saying

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.190 align:middle line:84%
the moon was created by
a collision between Earth

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.721 align:middle line:84%
and another planetary object,
which then formed the moon.

00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: That's right.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Amazing because he
talked about this years ago.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Really it's, again,
one of those things where

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.549 align:middle line:84%
modern science-- I think about
a year ago I saw this program

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
on the Discovery Channel
where they said this is called

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:84%
the Orpheus Theory where a
large extra solar planet whacked

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.805 align:middle line:84%
our primitive Earth
and then the debris--

00:07:25.805 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Created the moon.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Right.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Coalesced into our moon.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.544 align:middle line:90%
Very close to what Sitchin says.

00:07:29.544 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, what's
really interesting

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.970 align:middle line:84%
about the Sitchin
Hypothesis is we're

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:84%
looking for a planet
that's four to eight

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:90%
times the size of Earth.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:84%
So there have been all
these other little ice

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.287 align:middle line:90%
balls or planets that are--

00:07:41.287 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Planetoids.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.036 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Planetoids.

00:07:43.036 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:90%
You know, Sedna, Quaoar, Xena.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.912 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pluto.

00:07:45.912 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Pluto.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poor Pluto.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: But if
we find one that's

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.767 align:middle line:84%
four to eight times
the size of Earth,

00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
something that we would miss.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Most of the amateur
astronomers pick up things

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:84%
like Hale Bopp or Shoemaker
Levy 9 that whacked Jupiter--

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.005 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: -well before
the professional community.

00:08:00.005 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people,
some conspiracy theorists,

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
say that we already know
there's this planet out there

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
afraid to tell us.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Why would they be
afraid to tell us?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.743 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, you brought up
something interesting, George,

00:08:14.743 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:84%
about the past of Planet
X. And geologically,

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:90%
we've heard the term of Pangea.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And no one can really refute
now that the continents

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:90%
are like a skin of an apple.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:84%
They were all connected
to one large mass.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can
see it's like a puzzle.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:90%
They fit perfectly.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah, right.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:90%
And they all fit.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:84%
The idea of Pangea
is right in alignment

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:84%
with the ancient
Sumerian cosmology

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.340 align:middle line:84%
that this ancient planet
whacked our primitive Earth

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:84%
making it into half a planet and
strewing out the asteroid belt.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:84%
So, again, I think it's just
a matter of interpretation.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people have
approached our history

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.260 align:middle line:84%
either from a religious or
from a scientific viewpoint.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Overlapping those, we're
seeing massive crossover

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:84%
that we still have to
investigate further and hope

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.379 align:middle line:84%
that our sciences can catch
up to actually validate

00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:01.420 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these things that
were said in the past.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do believe there's
a Planet X out there?

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.258 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I firmly
believe there's

00:09:05.258 --> 00:09:07.210 align:middle line:84%
a Planet X. I think
it's a little bit more

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.929 align:middle line:84%
complicated to answer
based on new things

00:09:09.929 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:84%
that I've become
interested in, which

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:16.240 align:middle line:84%
is this precession of the
equinox and looking at the idea

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:84%
that we are possibly a
binary solar system, meaning

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.039 align:middle line:90%
not just one sun, two.

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:22.372 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where is the other sun?

00:09:22.372 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, it
could be a failed

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.839 align:middle line:84%
star at this point,
a brown dwarf.

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you couldn't
see it, basically.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: We can't see it,
but there's all the evidence

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:84%
to suggest something's been
hurling debris towards us.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Even Dr. Richard Muller
at Berkeley came up

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of Nemesis,
some planet that's

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.920 align:middle line:90%
orbiting that second sun--

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That could be--

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: -and dislodges.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.013 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: -Planet X, right?

00:09:42.013 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: It could be.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So I definitely
think that if we are

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:84%
going to look for the Sitchin
Planet X and the modern Planet

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:84%
X, it's going to
be an orbit Planet

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:90%
X that goes around two suns.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And that obviously changes
the orbital mechanics

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
of what we've traditionally
looked at from Nibiru

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.532 align:middle line:84%
and that 3,600 orbit of
that long elliptical orbit.

00:10:02.532 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
It has to be looping around
something else, you know.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.297 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are scientists
looking for this Planet X?

00:10:07.297 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: They are.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And as you mentioned,
is there a cover up?

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:84%
People are looking for
it, but to what degree

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:84%
they are labeling it the ancient
Sumerian Planet X, that's

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:90%
where it gets a little watery.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:90%
The Vatican has been looking.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I know there's observatories
in Hawaii and in Australia.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's a vast
array of things

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:84%
that the scientific
community is looking at.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
always specifically looking

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.770 align:middle line:84%
for Planet X. But there
have been telescopes

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that they've purposed
as planet hunters,

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and then they've been
re-purposed to look

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:84%
for specifically extra
solar planets, a Planet X.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they tell
us if they found it?

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: I don't know.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.428 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we look at some of
the things that have happened

00:10:49.428 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:84%
in the past, NASA,
National Aeronautics Space

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.529 align:middle line:84%
Administration, also means
never a straight answer.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, not to point
the finger at them,

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.970 align:middle line:84%
but some of these galactic
events like Shoemaker Levy 9

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.640 align:middle line:84%
broke up into large fragments
and impacted Jupiter

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.100 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that
it left holes that

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.434 align:middle line:84%
could fit four to eight Earths
in each of these little--

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:10.599 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And thank God
Jupiter was there to take it.

00:11:10.599 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yes.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.749 align:middle line:84%
But NASA said, don't
worry about it.

00:11:13.749 --> 00:11:15.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
anything interesting to see.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It was
very interesting.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or it won't
happen here, they thought.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Or it won't
happen here, right.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.030 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I think everyone
needs to pay attention

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.730 align:middle line:84%
to the space sciences that
we're doing, Goddard Space

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.595 align:middle line:84%
Center, JPL, and other agencies
around the world, Japan

00:11:30.595 --> 00:11:31.740 align:middle line:90%
and Europe.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:84%
That even as a layman
someone could pay attention

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and start to see
patterns of what they're

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.574 align:middle line:84%
looking into from
a corporate level,

00:11:38.574 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and kind of where
their focus will

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.581 align:middle line:90%
be over the next 10 to 20 years.

00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason Martell
with us, of course,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.329 align:middle line:90%
here on "Beyond Belief."

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Jason, do you believe
in the Anunnaki theory?

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:84%
That they came here, genetically
altered whatever creatures

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.464 align:middle line:84%
were on the planet,
and here we are?

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: I do.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, again,
I was very heavily

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
influenced by Zecharia
Sitchin's teachings

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and uncovering that this
ancient Sumerian culture talks

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:84%
about a time that we
today think of mythology,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.670 align:middle line:84%
they were interacting
with beings

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.082 align:middle line:90%
that they considered gods.

00:12:09.082 --> 00:12:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Now what I've come
to find, George,

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.140 align:middle line:84%
is that the Sumerian
epic of these Anunnaki

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
is around 6,000
years ago, 4,000 BC.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is in
complete alignment

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:84%
with all of our
biblical tales now,

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
the Old Testament,
the Christian version.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And so all these stories kind
of parallel this Anunnaki

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:90%
interaction.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But there are cultures
from all around the world,

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:84%
especially the
ancient Hindu gods,

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.420 align:middle line:84%
that go back thousands
and thousands of years

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
before our recorded history
that we're currently

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.590 align:middle line:84%
fascinated with now
in ancient Iraq.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
going to continue

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:84%
to evolve that there are other
cultures that had influence

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:53.270 align:middle line:84%
from some advanced race, whether
it was Anunnaki specifically.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I think there were definitely
other factions, not just

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki that
were interacting

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:90%
with human civilization.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You brought
us some images,

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.502 align:middle line:84%
and I want to go to image
number 1 first, Jason--

00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Great.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: -and have you
explain what that is.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: Well, this is
an image that is basically

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:10%
showing one of the
gods, a Sumerian god,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.710 align:middle line:10%
granting the plow to mankind.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:10%
Modern agriculture.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Nothing too interesting.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:10%
But as a backdrop, what we
see is a complete diagram

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:10%
of our solar system with the
sun depicted in the middle.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.834 align:middle line:10%
Now, Copernicus, Galileo, we
all thought we were the center--

00:13:31.834 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: -until we
had advanced astronomy.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could have
just looked at this

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and it would have
told you, right?

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.938 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Right.

00:13:36.938 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of evidence
that shows pictorial images.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, an image
is a thousand words

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that really start to raise our
eyebrows and understanding what

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:90%
they were really showing us.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let
me ask you, when

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.140 align:middle line:90%
this was-- how old is this?

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: This seal
is around 4,500 BC.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 4,500 BC, so
it's over 6,000 years old.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.501 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yes.

00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who made it?

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:01.614 align:middle line:90%
Humans?

00:14:01.614 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:10%
So basically how
this was invented

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:10%
was a Sumerian scribe,
who could read and write

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:10%
cuneiform script,
would reverse carve

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:10%
on a round surface--
which we still

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:10%
don't know how they did
this, they would reverse

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:10%
carve these images and
then roll it over wet clay

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:10%
to leave the positive imprint.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.025 align:middle line:84%
They'd take that
clay tablet, stick it

00:14:21.025 --> 00:14:23.262 align:middle line:90%
in a kiln, an ancient stove.

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Literally keying that
phrase, writing in stone.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And there it is.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.040 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: So they leave
us pictograms like this

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:10%
and then accompany
it with texts,

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.430 align:middle line:10%
so they could easily
disseminate throughout the town

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.157 align:middle line:10%
images and text.

00:14:33.157 --> 00:14:34.240 align:middle line:90%
Like an ancient newspaper.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: It really is.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:36.746 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Second image.

00:14:36.746 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this one.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.040 align:middle line:90%
What in the heck is this?

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, this
is a classic depiction

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.522 align:middle line:90%
of an Anunnaki from the back.

00:14:44.522 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And really what's
interesting, this

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:84%
is an Anunnaki named--
the God of Isis,

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
or she's also called Ninhursag,
a couple other names that

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.219 align:middle line:90%
come from various translations.

00:14:55.219 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
interesting is the detail

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:84%
that they went in
building this artifact.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
You can even see little
screws in the hands.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So again, I think this is
an interesting depiction

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
of the Anunnaki, these beings
who had the power of flight,

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:84%
and just the detail
and intricacy that they

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:84%
put into creating such
types of artifacts.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Are those wings?

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yes, those are wings.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And she is always depicted as
flying over the skies of Earth.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.950 align:middle line:84%
There's even a
Sumerian tale that

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
says she became attracted
to one of these kings

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:90%
and his name was Gilgamesh.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And King Gilgamesh
knew that whenever

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:84%
she would take any of the
men that she was attracted

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.210 align:middle line:84%
to into her sky abode,
they never returned.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:36.880 align:middle line:90%
[NOORY LAUGHS]

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So he politely
said no, thank you.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.320 align:middle line:84%
So there are lots
of tales that speak

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:90%
of this flying god, this female.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Next image, of course.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.841 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about this.

00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, this is
from the British Museum

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's labeled as
the Flood Tablet.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So very interesting
that there are--

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the
Noah's Flood tablet?

00:15:56.805 --> 00:15:57.805 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: That's right.

00:15:57.805 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a paper
version in the Bible.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.570 align:middle line:90%
We have an actual stone version.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And when they first
excavated this in Iraq,

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.176 align:middle line:84%
it was an ancient Arcadian
version-- Acadian.

00:16:07.176 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: -and the
gentleman, George Smith,

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:84%
upon translating it,
realized it was the flood

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and threw his hands
up and couldn't

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:18.980 align:middle line:84%
believe that he possibly
found the actual Flood Tablet.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That tablet
depicts Noah's Ark--

00:16:21.405 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yes.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:90%
It's part--

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: -and the flood?

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It's part of a
much longer epic in Sumerian

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.435 align:middle line:84%
where it talks about why
there was a great flood.

00:16:28.435 --> 00:16:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's incredible.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.184 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Yeah, it's
a little bit more

00:16:31.184 --> 00:16:33.750 align:middle line:84%
of an elongated tale than
the consolidated version

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:90%
we have in the Bible.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet,
different sources are

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:90%
talking about the same thing.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:90%
What does that make you think?

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:90%
That it really happened.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Well, you're right.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a
Sumerian version.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:90%
This is an Acadian version.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
We have the Old Testament,
the New Testament, King James.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So, pretty much,
the Bible is just

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.850 align:middle line:84%
stories that have been put
together from various sources.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And there are various depictions
of this same tale told

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:84%
in other Semitic languages,
and you kind of piece those

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:84%
all together to get
a clear picture.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would there be anything
in the tablet or the Bible,

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Jason, that would
lead us to believe

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:84%
that the story of the flood
might have been caused

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:90%
by an asteroid hit in the ocean?

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Or that it was restricted
to a certain area as opposed

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.194 align:middle line:90%
to the entire planet?

00:17:23.194 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: You know, I
don't know of any specifics.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But in this elongated version,
the Epic of Enuma Elish,

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.030 align:middle line:84%
it does talk about
why there was a flood,

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and it talks about
this Planet X.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.172 align:middle line:84%
This ancient Nibiru
passing by our planet--

00:17:39.172 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Creating this.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And it basically just cracked
off a piece of the ice,

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.510 align:middle line:84%
dropping it in a glass of water,
instantly raising the water

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:46.010 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, huge.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.069 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: And so
that's pretty much

00:17:48.069 --> 00:17:50.439 align:middle line:84%
what it's explaining as why
there was a great flood.

00:17:50.439 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.652 align:middle line:90%
Next image.

00:17:53.652 --> 00:17:54.735 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Well, classic--

00:17:54.735 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A solar system.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Classic depiction
of our solar system.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nothing unusual
about that, or is there?

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.591 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, you
know, most people

00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:03.590 align:middle line:84%
think that we're on the
third rock from the sun.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:84%
You hear that from
the popular term.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But actually, if you're
coming from outside

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system in,
Earth is the seventh planet.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Sacred number 7,
7 days in a week.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
the Sumerians depicted Earth

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.100 align:middle line:90%
as key, the seventh planet.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And the image is really showing
a model of-- the Sumerians

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
were aware of all the planets
we know of, but included

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:84%
this additional planet,
Nibiru, as a 12th planet.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.747 align:middle line:84%
So they counted the
nine planets, our Sun,

00:18:30.747 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and our Moon--

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now let
me ask you something.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: -and then Nibiru.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.176 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me
ask you something.

00:18:34.176 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah?

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Most of
the outer planets

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:84%
weren't discovered
until way later.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: That's right.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you saying
that the Sumerians already

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.057 align:middle line:90%
knew that they were there?

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: They did.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.045 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't send probes
into the outer region

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.290 align:middle line:90%
of space, Galileo, Voyager.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:84%
We're talking late
'70s, early '80s,

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:84%
we got the first color
pictures of Pluto and Uranus.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
they are identically

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:84%
matched for the Sumerian
descriptions of Pluto

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and Uranus being bluish-green,
calling it mosh sea.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.530 align:middle line:84%
They literally gave the distance
between the planets as well.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, it's very
miraculous that our science

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.157 align:middle line:84%
is confirming what they
knew 6,000 years ago.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody gave
them celestial information.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.156 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: I think so.

00:19:20.156 --> 00:19:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.040 align:middle line:90%
All right, next image.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So again, just
an artistic rendition

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:84%
of our Earth and
understanding that there

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
could have been a
time in our past

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:84%
where Nibiru was literally in
the vicinity of our planet.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
There are obviously
the descriptions

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.740 align:middle line:84%
of this interaction
that caused havoc,

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.090 align:middle line:90%
but that was well in our past.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It could be that in
the future, there

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.590 align:middle line:84%
could be successive orbits that
allow further communication

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:84%
between Nibiru and
Earth, if there

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:84%
are beings living
on that planet.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So give us
an overview, Jason,

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:84%
of what you think is out
there in the universe

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.894 align:middle line:84%
that we don't understand,
that we're not being told.

00:20:01.894 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, from
a real high level,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I think that when
we look at shows

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:06.950 align:middle line:84%
like "Star Trek"
and "Star Wars,"

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:84%
there's this Galactic
Federation of Planets and races

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:84%
that are intelligently
working together.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably the
norm across other worlds,

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:84%
is that if we ever do discover
intelligent life, not just

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.470 align:middle line:84%
bacterial life,
intelligent life,

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:84%
there has to be a
system of law and order

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:84%
to maintaining that
level of integrity.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think everything
happens for a reason,

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and it appears that
our civilization is

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
on a path to exponentially
learning more, opening

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:84%
the door to are we alone,
and learning things

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
about ghosts and
other dimensions.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
kind of, again,

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
cross over into our
sciences needing to catch up

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and things that we think
are paranormal today

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.837 align:middle line:90%
might become science tomorrow.

00:20:49.837 --> 00:20:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late "New
York Times" science writer,

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Walter Sullivan, wrote a
book called "We Are Not

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Alone," fascinated me when I
was a kid, about his theories

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
that there were other
intelligent life

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.960 align:middle line:90%
forms out there in the universe.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.995 align:middle line:84%
And there could be hundreds,
thousands, millions, billions--

00:21:08.995 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: I hope so.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: -that are
out there all striving

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:84%
to find out what we're
trying to find out right now,

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:90%
and that's that simple answer.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.022 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:21:18.022 --> 00:21:18.762 align:middle line:90%
What are we?

00:21:18.762 --> 00:21:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Right.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And the more we look to our
past, these mythological tales

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:84%
that clearly depict
beings and interaction

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:84%
with technological
references, I think

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:84%
we're going to further
explore these topics

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and find that science
can answer it.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:84%
We just need to continue
to go down this path.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.782 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What fascinates
you about all this, Jason?

00:21:38.782 --> 00:21:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Well--

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The quest?

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.846 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Yeah, I
think it's the quest.

00:21:41.846 --> 00:21:44.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I
was a child, there

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
was things that made me
excited and mystery, right?

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Today, there's not much mystery.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Everything we kind of know.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We think we know.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.386 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: We think we know.

00:21:54.386 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I love this
research is it brings back

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
the child-like interest of being
curious and wanting to really

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:84%
have the sense of
wonder in our reality.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think we'll
ever get these answers?

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: I sure hope so.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm definitely making it
a quest in my lifetime.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I've already seen that this
wasn't a path that I chose;

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.680 align:middle line:90%
it was put before me.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And my life is like
a platter of fruit,

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:84%
it's just filling up with
things that make me happy.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And the way I want to give back
is the technology and things

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
that we are learning today
through our connected world,

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.340 align:middle line:84%
through drones and various
other things that we're doing,

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:84%
sensors and biometric
pressure sensors.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of things that we

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.550 align:middle line:84%
can do to start to look at these
ancient sites and deploy radar

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and technology and get a
clearer picture of what

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:45.350 align:middle line:90%
might be buried.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Or things that we don't
fully understand yet,

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I think our sciences are
going to start to further push

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:84%
this envelope with our computing
capability and just access

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.336 align:middle line:90%
to technology in general.

00:22:55.336 --> 00:22:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
any scientists

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
out there that you
would say they're

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:90%
trying to get these answers?

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yes, definitely.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.085 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
feel very grateful,

00:23:06.085 --> 00:23:07.460 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of
these people now

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:84%
are either colleagues
or friends of mine.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.722 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Walter Cruttenden
with the Binary Research

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, Goddard Space Center,
Jet Propulsion Laboratories.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these companies, while
they are government-controlled

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.390 align:middle line:84%
or government funded,
there is a breakout process

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:84%
happening right now
where, as you know,

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.381 align:middle line:84%
NASA isn't even doing
shuttle missions anymore.

00:23:29.381 --> 00:23:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It's all
private space industry.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of room
for entrepreneurs and people

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.500 align:middle line:84%
who can get together
and figure out a new way

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.090 align:middle line:84%
to do this, and maybe push
the envelope in science

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.610 align:middle line:84%
as well as risk beyond what NASA
would traditionally have done.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, within our lifetime,
whether or not the answers

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:84%
will be all given
to us, probably not.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But are we alone in
the universe, things

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.715 align:middle line:84%
that have happened to us in the
past, I think a lot more light

00:23:56.715 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:90%
can be shed on these topics.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And going back to these
ancient civilizations again,

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things that
they might have experienced.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Whether they were told
things from those above

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
or they had
knowledge far greater

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:84%
than what we believe
they had today,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:84%
fascinating how they were
able to come up with this.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I think of things
like the Dogon Tribe,

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
Sirius star system.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:84%
What was it, hundreds of
years before we found out

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.834 align:middle line:84%
that there was indeed a
Sirius star system out there?

00:24:27.834 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
this Dogon Tribe

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.300 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of connections
with ancient Egypt.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very
interesting that yes, there

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:41.350 align:middle line:84%
are cultures that were
disconnected from civilization,

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.370 align:middle line:84%
yet echo the same knowledge
from high civilizations

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:45.880 align:middle line:90%
that we know of today.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
a lot of answers

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.170 align:middle line:90%
that we are going to uncover.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.860 align:middle line:84%
That's definitely
my quest of interest

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:84%
is to look at a
lot of these sites,

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:56.224 align:middle line:84%
and not just go there and take
pictures, but use technology

00:24:56.224 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:84%
to push the needle
in our understanding.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.473 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
one aspect of what

00:24:59.473 --> 00:25:01.415 align:middle line:84%
you do that excites
you more than anything?

00:25:01.415 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, I
got to say right now

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.030 align:middle line:90%
it's utilizing drone technology.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:10%
Being able to mount sensors
on lightweight aerial packages

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:10%
where you can get
video footage, but also

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.787 align:middle line:10%
ground penetrating radar and
barometric pressure readings.

00:25:16.787 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
things that are going

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.870 align:middle line:10%
to allow us to lighten the
load that we might have

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:10%
traditionally used in a
large 747 or something

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.390 align:middle line:10%
to go over a location.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.350 align:middle line:84%
They are going to now be small
instruments highly-packed

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.384 align:middle line:90%
with scientific data.

00:25:30.384 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
good part of drones.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Yes, that's
the good part of drones.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, if
people want to monitor

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.661 align:middle line:84%
what you do, where
do they find you?

00:25:36.661 --> 00:25:38.160 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: Well,
they could probably

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.380 align:middle line:10%
follow along with us
at ancientexplorers.com

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.180 align:middle line:10%
where we're going to be
going to a lot of these sites

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:43.680 align:middle line:10%
first-hand.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good luck on
many of your missions.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Thank you.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:47.665 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One day, maybe
we'll get the answers

00:25:47.665 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:10%
to who are we, what are we,
doing are we doing here?

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.680 align:middle line:10%
We need people like Jason
Martell, true researchers,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:10%
true explorers to
get these answers.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thank you
for watching "Beyond Belief."
