>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to this edition

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.432 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief,"
I'm George Noory,

00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:23.640 align:middle line:10%
and we've got a great
guest for you tonight.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:10%
Rohini Moradi is the founder
of the community and podcast

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.170 align:middle line:10%
called "Magic Inclined."

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And after a
near-death experience

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:84%
that eventually took the
life of her young baby girl,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Rohini began her
self-healing journey.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Now she is an Akashic Records
teacher and an explorer.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.768 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Beyond
Belief," Rohini.

00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:10%
>>ROHINI MORADI: Thank you so
much for having me on the show.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.750 align:middle line:10%
It's an honor to be with you.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did your
little daughter go?

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:10%
>>MORADI: Well, she
passed away from SIDS.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.420 align:middle line:10%
So at two months old,
one night she went to bed

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:10%
and just didn't wake
up the next day.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.837 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a parent,
I feel for you.

00:01:01.837 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Thank you.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have any notice
that there was something wrong?

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Or you just went into the
room and there she was?

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:84%
We had noticed, but I
didn't really realize

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.058 align:middle line:90%
what that notice was until--

00:01:16.058 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was too late.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And during her birth,
we both lost our breath.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Our heart rate dropped
below comfort levels.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.903 align:middle line:90%
I left my body.

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you in danger?

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.778 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: We were both
in danger of dying

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:90%
when she was being born.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:84%
We got rushed to the
emergency C-section room,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:90%
and the doctors were panicking.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:90%
And at a certain point, like--

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you alert?

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I was, but
then I left my body

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:90%
and I became more alert.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I was just in panic
mode up until the point

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.510 align:middle line:84%
that I was above
myself looking down.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: As I was
doing that, I--

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Classic
near-death experience.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, mm-hmm.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you
back into your body?

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I felt love.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I felt, like, a lot of
love, and I saw myself.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to cry,
but for the first time

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
in a really long
time, maybe ever, I

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:90%
loved myself and my life.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, I didn't
want to live my life.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't-- there
was just something--

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.710 align:middle line:90%
this deep unhappiness within me.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
But seeing myself as
the human that I am

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that I'm
beyond this human,

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
but this human is important
and special made me--

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you understand
what was happening to you?

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.558 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You had no idea?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.653 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I had no idea.

00:02:41.653 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't know if
you were dead, alive, or what.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I had no idea.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:84%
I just saw people screaming and
panicking, and as I'm going up

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'm seeing
myself while people

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.683 align:middle line:84%
are screaming and
panicking, yeah, my life

00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:90%
changed in an instant.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I came back and I was
just on cloud nine.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is
common for mothers

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:90%
who just have their babies.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
She was born, she
was on my chest.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was beyond that because
I had my daughter, Pele,

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:90%
prior to that, too.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I know that feeling
of love you feel

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.170 align:middle line:84%
for your child for
the first time.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:90%
This was different.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
There's like a whole
layer of appreciation

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:90%
that I have never felt.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But meeting her
for the first time,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:84%
too, it felt like
a kindred spirit.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you still
in touch with her now?

00:03:31.215 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I am not because when
we were in India to surrender

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.110 align:middle line:84%
her ashes, we saw the
same astrologer who

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
had given the premonition
the year before

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.650 align:middle line:90%
and we told them what happened.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at my
relationship-- me

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and my husband's
relationship with her

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and realized that we
need to let her go.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you need to stop
calling on her so much,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and you need to let her
go on her soul's journey.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Like she came to wake you up
so that you can live your life,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and calling on her constantly
and trying to get these answers

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:84%
is depriving you of fully
doing what you need to do.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Akashic Records.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.318 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: There are
many different ways

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
of explaining it,
but the one that

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
makes the most sense to me,
it's just astral bodies of light

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that contain information
from past, present,

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.110 align:middle line:90%
and possible future.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who records these?

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well,
we do as we live,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and the trees do
as they breathe.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much
ether pre-manifest.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you could imagine
energy continuously being

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:84%
regenerated through
different lives,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
it's that energy
behind the life.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember the
movie "The Truman Show?"

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I do.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember--

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a recording of
everything he did in his life.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Mm-hmm.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And later on, almost
like the Akashic Records--

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They played them back.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So when he was six, he did
something, they played it back.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.720 align:middle line:84%
When he was 15,
they played it back.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Is that what the
Akashic Records are?

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Where it's almost like
a history of our life?

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yes, absolutely.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And the planet's life
and the universe's life.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it's the
energy behind it all.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when we're
up to make our maker,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
do they pull out
the Akashic Records?

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:90%
You did this and you did that!

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I actually don't
know if I'll ever know that

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:90%
personally in this lifetime.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:10%
And I do firmly believe that
while we are in these bodies,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:10%
having information like
that is really difficult.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed to know what
happened so that we can fully

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:90%
be humans now.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
discover these Records?

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:10%
>>MORADI: Well, it
was by accident,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:10%
but through the tragedy
of losing my daughter.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:10%
It's an incredible
story, actually,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.730 align:middle line:10%
and I keep having to retell
myself the different events

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:10%
that took place because
it's unbelievable to me

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:10%
still how this all happened.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
But after her passing,
my first instinct

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:84%
was to take her
ashes back to India

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:90%
and give them to the Ganges.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is a pretty
popular custom in India.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:84%
After someone passes, you
return their body to the Ganges,

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and this is supposed to help
them ascend to their next level

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.115 align:middle line:90%
and clear their path in a way.

00:06:34.115 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: So I really
wanted to do that for her.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
The thought of her came
about when we were in India,

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
in a really small
town called Rishikesh.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I had this astrology reading
that pretty much gave us

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:84%
the premonition that she
would come into our lives,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
but didn't give the full
story of what would happen.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
So we named her Rishi
after the town Rishikesh.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you know about the
Akashic records at that time?

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No, not at all.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.658 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: So after
she passed away,

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I had never even heard of it
until months after she passed.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
But about nine days
after she passed away,

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
there was this
magnificent full moon,

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and my husband and I and
a few friends of ours

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:84%
went to the backyard and
just prayed and asked

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.420 align:middle line:84%
for some type of communication
with her because we

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.860 align:middle line:90%
wanted to make sure she was OK.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.902 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, of course.

00:07:28.902 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: We were in pain.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you go to a
medium or anything like that?

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No, I didn't.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I didn't really
do stuff like that then.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And that same
night, it so happens

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:84%
that a woman that we don't
know is actually my husband's

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.950 align:middle line:90%
sister's husband's coworker.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So far enough removed
where we wouldn't have ever

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.720 align:middle line:90%
met her otherwise.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Started having dreams about us.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And she kept it to herself, and
weeks later, we were in India,

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and we just happened
to be there the day--

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:84%
we got there the day
before Mother's Day.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And on Mother's Day,
we received word

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.982 align:middle line:84%
that she has had one
dream weeks before,

00:08:12.982 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and now she's had a
second dream, so they

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:90%
wanted to tell us about them.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And were the
dreams of the little girl?

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.720 align:middle line:90%
They're very strange.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'll give
you the gist of them.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I feel like they were
delivered by the little girl,

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think
that it personally--

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't her in the dreams-- or
it might have been, who knows?

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But the first dream was about
us being in a little town called

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Rishikesh that I just
told you about, going

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:90%
to this school for children.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And the woman saw a
school with the words--

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and she couldn't
figure out what it was,

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.890 align:middle line:84%
but she recognized
landmarks in Rishikesh.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So she knew we were
in India somewhere,

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and then when she looked
it up after the dreams,

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:84%
they're in Rishikesh,
and there's

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:84%
this school there with this
woman who wears all white

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:90%
that they're supposed to meet.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And she started
Googling and Googling

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and found this school
called Mother Miracle run

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:84%
by an Iranian woman
named Shahla Ettefagh.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.680 align:middle line:90%
And she wears only all white.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And we were about 15 minutes
away from this school

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:84%
when we found out
about it in the dreams.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So this was the
beginning of the journey

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.250 align:middle line:84%
to find the Akashic
Records for me.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.560 align:middle line:84%
We just started
following the prompts.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
obsessed with trying

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:90%
to find out the information?

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I like this question.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.767 align:middle line:90%
In a way, yeah, I was, because--

00:09:47.767 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would be.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.300 align:middle line:84%
It was a strange
thing to have happen.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And somebody-- I don't
know having dreams with me

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
specifically in it going to
specific places that actually

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:84%
exist where this woman didn't
know about really became,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I feel, maybe a healthy
obsession at the time

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:16.450 align:middle line:84%
because it took my mind off of
the pain my body was feeling

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.860 align:middle line:90%
and just how--

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:84%
it gave like a
little bit of hope.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In most religions,
they call the Good

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:90%
Book your record of your life.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that the same
as the Akashic Records?

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:84%
It lives-- this
idea lives with so

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:84%
many different Indigenous
cultures and religions.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So many popular
religions we know now

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:84%
has some type of reference
to it where the whole idea,

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:84%
even like in Christianity
with you go to the gates

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and your life is
reviewed or whatnot,

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:90%
it all comes from the same idea.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what happens
when they do the review?

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:90%
What did they do with that?

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Did they decide to send
you to Heaven or Hell?

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Are you dead when the
review is underway?

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I can't answer
that question because I

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:90%
don't know for certain.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.680 align:middle line:84%
But I know that there
is these studies done

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
on what happens to us
right before we die,

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and how when your brain
shuts down like a computer,

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.090 align:middle line:84%
it kind of goes
through all the files.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
imagine it to be,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:84%
where it's just like a
reliving of the imprint

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
that you have contributed
to the universe.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can anybody tap
into the Akashic Records?

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I believe so.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But I don't feel like
everyone's ready or interested.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:90%
But anybody really can.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And to tell you the
bottom line, we're

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.170 align:middle line:84%
tapping into the Akashic
Records in all moments of life.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:84%
We are sitting here
tapping in at the moment.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.535 align:middle line:84%
It's just the intention
behind the information--

00:11:52.535 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm reading
yours as we speak.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.845 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:11:55.845 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chapter four, you
better to watch out for.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Oof!

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.073 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully chapter
four already happened.

00:12:01.073 --> 00:12:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how
do you tap into them?

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, there are
many different techniques,

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:84%
but the technique I
like to use is directly

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.110 align:middle line:90%
tied to my upbringing.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's about getting familiar
with your inner energy centers

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and releasing the tension
around each energy center

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:84%
so that you can open
up the connection

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:84%
between your inner body
and your energetic body.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you alter
the Akashic Records?

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Or is it what it is?

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: It is what it
is because the future can

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.730 align:middle line:84%
obviously always be altered
based on the present,

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:45.805 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think you can go
back in time and alter it.

00:12:45.805 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It reminds me of
Gene Wilder and the movie

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:84%
"Pretty Woman" where
he goes, "What it is."

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: "What it is."

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is what it is.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: It is what it is.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're creating
it every moment

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
that we live and
breathe and feel.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's a beautiful collection.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you regularly
practice Akashic Record

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:90%
training?

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm obsessed with it, obviously.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you?

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I am.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I do, but these days, it
looks a lot different.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, I was obsessed
with the information behind it.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:84%
The capability of
getting to know

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
my soul on the different
dimensional levels that I can,

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:84%
but at this point in
time, my happy place

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
is just being able
to sit and feel

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.230 align:middle line:84%
this oneness of the
vibrational frequencies

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:84%
of the Akasha, and just the
ether, this life itself.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Being able to connect with
my mind, body, and soul

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
is my preference.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can the
Akashic Records, Rohini,

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:90%
make you a better person?

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, I'll tell you
how it made me a better person.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:90%
It gave me perspective on life.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.210 align:middle line:84%
It gave me an overview
of the human connection,

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:84%
the connection with nature, how
what I do in this moment right

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:84%
now today will affect
someone else tomorrow.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So I feel it gives us the
overview and perspective

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:90%
of what is possible.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you've had
various reincarnated lives,

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:84%
would you have separate
Akashic Records?

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or would they
be all in the same book?

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: It's all
in the same book.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the same soul going
through different vessels.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And the same-- and all
the different souls

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:84%
together all have an
Akashic Records together.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Like our connection
will have its own record

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that we go and take
our separate ways.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there techniques
to tap into the Akashic Records?

00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain
what they could be.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Meditation.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And after you get really
good at meditation,

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't happen
too often, meditation

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.597 align:middle line:90%
is a practice of life.

00:15:03.597 --> 00:15:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: But it's
the intention you

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.410 align:middle line:84%
build behind the
practice of meditation,

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and that intention can be
achieved without meditation

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:90%
after practice.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Another way that
I've discovered--

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'm absolutely in
love with these days,

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
is using frequencies,
different frequencies.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And this actually
happened by accident

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.140 align:middle line:84%
while I was in the middle of
teaching some of my students

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.810 align:middle line:84%
during a training,
I started getting

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.960 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with plant
frequency and recording

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
the different
frequencies plants emit

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and converting that
into musical notes.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, when I put those
frequencies in a theta state,

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.355 align:middle line:84%
it helped my students achieve
that connection a lot faster.

00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, plants
have a live basis.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
remember Cleve Backster?

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Do you ever remember his work?

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.658 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No, actually.

00:15:56.658 --> 00:15:59.302 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He would hook
up plants to electrodes.

00:15:59.302 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, mm-hmm.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he did
an experiment one day

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:84%
where he had a plant with
an electrode all hooked up,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and we could see the
beep of the-- almost

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:90%
like the heartbeat of the plant.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Beep, beep, beep, beep.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:84%
He had another plant
next to that plant

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and sent a guy in who
shredded that plant.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Oh my--

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pulled it
out of the little vase

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and chopped it up
and everything else.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.340 align:middle line:84%
The beep on the other plant
that was there as a witness

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.390 align:middle line:84%
went beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep, beep.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And then he left and
it calmed down again.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:42.140 align:middle line:84%
He came back into the room
and it picked up again.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:84%
It tells you plants
have an intelligence.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:90%
And they are communicating--

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Think of that the next
time you bite into a carrot,

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:50.781 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:54.877 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: [LAUGHS]
I'll try not to.

00:16:54.877 --> 00:16:57.317 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:57.317 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
anything about the Records

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:84%
that somebody should
be embarrassed about?

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No, not at all.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that I've learned
through my personal exploration

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and through guiding
my students is

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:84%
that the things that we
think are embarrassing

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:84%
or the things we're not
proud of ourselves about

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:21.530 align:middle line:84%
are viewed as a third person,
and there's like a loving

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:25.160 align:middle line:84%
blanket around that view as well
where you're seeing the person

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.829 align:middle line:84%
and why they did
the things they did.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:84%
There's usually many
reasons behind it.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So once you see what
brought somebody

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:84%
to make a certain decision, you
have more compassion for them

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and we have more
compassion for ourselves

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:84%
when we view those things
within our own records.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they show
everything, good and bad,

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.628 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Mm-hmm.

00:17:46.628 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And should
we be embarrassed

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.790 align:middle line:90%
when the bad stuff pops up?

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No, I don't think so.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's about
learning, accepting,

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:59.115 align:middle line:84%
and using that knowledge
to not let it happen again.

00:17:59.115 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Mm-hmm.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to be
alive or dead to tap into this?

00:18:04.765 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well,
when you're dead,

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.660 align:middle line:90%
your ether pre-manifests again.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
little too late, hmm?

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.808 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Well, you're in it.

00:18:12.808 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:84%
You're in that frequency,
but yeah, being alive,

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:90%
I think, is--

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's not even something
that is necessary,

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:84%
but it does really help a
person live more intentionally

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:90%
and fully in their purpose.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Because now, instead of having
the information that we receive

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:84%
in our lifetimes,
the programming

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.190 align:middle line:84%
we've received we've
seen or whatnot,

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.270 align:middle line:84%
now we have lifetimes
of experience

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:84%
that we can call upon for
different frustrations

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:84%
in our lives or
to seek which path

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.070 align:middle line:90%
we should follow or whatnot.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.907 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of having the
biggest life coach there is--

00:18:55.907 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.782 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: --to guide you.

00:18:57.782 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us a process
of tapping into the Akashic

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:01.570 align:middle line:90%
Records.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:90%
So what I--

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kind of teach us.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:10%
What I personally do is I
get into a meditative state

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.330 align:middle line:10%
and I visit each energy
center within my body.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:10%
>>MORADI: I open
them up and I just

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:10%
release whatever tension
is sitting there.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Once that happens,
I feel a lightness,

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and there and at this
point, I am grounding myself

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:84%
into the Earth, I'm
opening up my crown chakra,

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll go
down into my heart

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:90%
and I'll start opening it up.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm opening up my
heart and releasing whatever

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:84%
boundaries I've
placed in front of it,

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:84%
then I will go to my throat
energy center, my throat

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:47.380 align:middle line:84%
chakra, and out loud declare
that I am intentionally

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.250 align:middle line:90%
tapping in now.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And the throat
chakra is directly

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.527 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
Akasha through--

00:19:52.527 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does your voice change?

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No, it doesn't.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But the vibrational
frequencies--

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
do that right now?

00:19:58.570 --> 00:19:59.653 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, of course.

00:19:59.653 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I say, the Records are
now open, or, I am now

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:90%
connected fully to the Akasha.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you chant?

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.718 align:middle line:90%
I love chanting.

00:20:09.718 --> 00:20:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give us a chant.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: OK.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Ommmm.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.712 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.712 --> 00:20:15.512 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ommmm.

00:20:15.512 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: And the beautiful
thing with Om, too,

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:84%
is when you say it,
you want to feel

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that frequency go all
the way up your spine,

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.010 align:middle line:84%
open up, and then
recycle back down,

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's an easy way to
open up your energy centers.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back in the '60s,
hippies would do that.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
always used to think,

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong with these people?

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.250 align:middle line:84%
But maybe they were
ahead of the game, huh?

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they took a
lot from Hinduism,

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.570 align:middle line:84%
which they've been doing
for thousands of years.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there any limit
as to how big your Akashic

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Records can be?

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Just like the universe,
we are always expanding.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It's infinite expansion.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
more you're into it,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.650 align:middle line:84%
the better you should
become as a human being?

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No, not necessarily.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No?

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I mean, it depends.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:90%
It depends on what you decide.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're all here for
different journeys.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's even tough to
say that someone who

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.790 align:middle line:84%
practices that often
is automatically

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:90%
a good or bad human.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the
tens of thousands

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.630 align:middle line:84%
of people who are going to
be watching this program

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and are watching
it now, what advice

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:84%
would you give them when
they're sitting back

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.260 align:middle line:84%
going, I want to get
into my Akashic Records,

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to see what I've done
since I was a little boy.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:90%
I want to track my soul.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:90%
What would you tell them?

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I would
tell them to go for it

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
and how expansive and beautiful
their journey is going to be,

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.980 align:middle line:84%
but the main thing is, once you
have that intention set in mind

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
that this is something
you want to do,

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
you just have to sit
down and practice it.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.620 align:middle line:90%
And it takes quite some time.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not an automatic, I'm going
to see what the whole universe

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:90%
is about kind of situation.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.412 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can everybody tap
into the Akashic Records?

00:22:15.412 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I believe so.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:84%
If they truly want to,
they definitely can.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No mistakes?

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I mean,
it takes some time

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:84%
to learn discernment, especially
with the unseen world.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's a practice.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So through that practice,
you learn from your mistakes.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are there helpers?

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual helpers who
help you along the way?

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I believe so.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.978 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
dealt with any of them?

00:22:42.978 --> 00:22:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Yeah,
I have, actually.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:90%
And one of them came to me--

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:84%
because of that woman's
dreams, she came--

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's the spirit
of Anandamayi

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:84%
who I didn't know
about prior to this,

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:01.670 align:middle line:84%
but she's the one who helps
me and helps guide me.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a bearded
man standing over you now.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Oh no!

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who claims that
he is responsible for most

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.620 align:middle line:90%
of your Akashic Records.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Wow.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now who would he be?

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I have no idea.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see him.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:90%
I have that ability.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Wow.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.330 align:middle line:90%
So you do.

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:90%
You know what's interesting?

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.448 align:middle line:84%
The first time I tapped
into the Akasha--

00:23:23.448 --> 00:23:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you see him?

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I saw him.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't known who
he is and now I'm feeling.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He says he's not
Jesus or anything like that.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: No, but he
has the long beard.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's got a
long, white beard.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's got a
white robe, white hair.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:90%
And he kind of glows.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: That's who I saw.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.737 align:middle line:84%
And I saw him up in the
clouds, and I was like--

00:23:45.737 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might he have been
your grandfather or somebody

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I don't think I've
known him in this lifetime.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he assigned to you?

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Maybe.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.945 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.945 --> 00:24:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've been
given the opportunity--

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's smiling right now.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Really?

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now
he's waving goodbye.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Aww.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And off he goes.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
that was all about.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea,
but it's bizarre.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.897 align:middle line:90%
But you have seen him?

00:24:14.897 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I have seen him.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I saw him the first
time ever and that's it.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And the first time I
tapped into the Akasha,

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't experienced
enough to ask questions

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.160 align:middle line:90%
or to hold on to that state.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a very quick
flash and it went away,

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and I really have
not seen it since.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He noticed
me, kind of smiled,

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:90%
but he wasn't talking to me.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.330 align:middle line:90%
He was more interested in you.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Wow.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could he
be a guardian angel?

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I believe so.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that feels
right in my heart.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:84%
The thing that keeps coming
up for me is my heritage.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.040 align:middle line:10%
I'm Iranian, and
through our bloodline,

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:10%
we have a lot of mystics
and a lot of magi.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like it's
from that time,

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.740 align:middle line:84%
from the Zoroastrians
ruling Persia era.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that's
where he's from.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.127 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
get into a car accident?

00:25:07.127 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I did.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's in the book.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So why am I
tapping into your book?

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.128 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I don't know.

00:25:13.128 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.633 align:middle line:84%
That car accident
almost killed me.

00:25:16.633 --> 00:25:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
wasn't your fault.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: It wasn't my fault.
I was in the passenger seat.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:28.900 align:middle line:84%
It's actually-- it's been a
recurring sore spot in my life

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.130 align:middle line:90%
since it happened.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The little old man
claims that he pulled you out

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:90%
of the accident.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Hmm.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:90%
The same one?

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same person.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So he apparently has been
with you for a long time.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Wow.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But do we all
have somebody like him?

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Is there somebody
with me right now?

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I don't have
that ability to see that.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.150 align:middle line:90%
I wish I did.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.620 align:middle line:90%
But I bet.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
What I've noticed
during readings--

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.953 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can I see
yours and I can't see mine?

00:25:54.953 --> 00:25:55.912 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I don't know.

00:25:55.912 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:90%
So you can't see your own?

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Interesting.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.492 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I don't know.

00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's all
about energy, isn't it?

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, it really is.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who started, in your
opinion, the Akashic Records?

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Nobody.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.040 align:middle line:90%
No one.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that it was a
common ritual in India--

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are various
cultures aware of this?

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they all
call it the same thing?

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I know in Sanskrit and
Hinduism, they called it Akash.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's something similar
in Buddhism as well.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Their word for it like
translates to astral

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.915 align:middle line:90%
light, astral bodies of light.

00:26:42.915 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it sometimes
called "The Book of Life?"

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Different religions
have different things--

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:49.165 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:26:49.165 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
But many Indigenous
cultures have studied--

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shamans?

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:58.300 align:middle line:90%
Moors, druids, you name it.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Mayans.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What determines
what goes into the book?

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.555 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: The energy we emit.

00:27:07.555 --> 00:27:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you can't
put everything in it.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't put Rohini
had a chicken dinner tonight.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:14.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the book.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are
emotional things

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.480 align:middle line:84%
that deal with special
things that happen.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Our heart emits what is written.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You helped
a homeless person.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:90%
I bet that's in the book.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.202 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stuff like that.

00:27:28.202 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: If your heart
was in it, absolutely.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what's the next
step for the Akashic Records?

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, for me, is
to continue being a student

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to humble
myself more and more every day

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.430 align:middle line:84%
so that I can be
connected to my soul,

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and we are connected
to our soul,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
but my struggle and I feel
like a lot of humans' struggle

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:84%
lays behind trying to take
the wheel from our soul

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and putting that
control in our lives,

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:84%
but my practice every day from
going forth is letting my soul

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:10.300 align:middle line:84%
drive without me having
that draw to take the wheel.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What famous
people have been

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:90%
linked to the Akashic Records?

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Well, so many.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Two of my favorites
are Nikola Tesla

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and I love Edgar Cayce,
who's the grandfather.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla is
my favorite person

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:84%
to talk about in this
regard because he actually

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:34.960 align:middle line:84%
had a guru, Swami
Vivekananda, who

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.178 align:middle line:84%
used to guide him and
help him with energy

00:28:38.178 --> 00:28:39.220 align:middle line:90%
and his inner world and--

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he
did a great job.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: He did a great job.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:84%
But Tesla's mind
was prepared to go

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.760 align:middle line:84%
to the places he
went with it as well.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:53.620 align:middle line:84%
He educated himself and just had
that genius mind to begin with,

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.633 align:middle line:90%
his DNA.

00:28:54.633 --> 00:28:56.050 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, he's one
of my favorites

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.330 align:middle line:84%
to talk about because
the things he discovered

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:84%
he would say that he would
go to bed with a question

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:90%
and wake up with an answer.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And I fully contribute
that to the inner work

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:90%
that he was doing with his guru.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.125 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't
it be wonderful

00:29:09.125 --> 00:29:12.550 align:middle line:84%
if they came up
with a computer app

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:84%
that you can tap into your
Akashic Records electronically

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:17.640 align:middle line:90%
on your computer?

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it just comes up.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.395 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: It would
be so wonderful.

00:29:21.395 --> 00:29:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd get one.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I would get one, too.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:27.217 align:middle line:84%
But would that take the mystique
out of it if it was like--

00:29:27.217 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think so.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think so.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Maybe it
would help more people.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.385 align:middle line:84%
That's like a part of my
mission, too, is like--

00:29:33.385 --> 00:29:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Know your
Akashic Records.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Download the app.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Akasha, the app name.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I have astrologers
on the "Coast-to-Coast"

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:90%
radio show.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.440 align:middle line:90%
And people call in for readings.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But most
of the astrologers

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.160 align:middle line:90%
aren't doing it from memory.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.000 align:middle line:84%
They have a-- they're
sitting at a computer.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you will call in
and say, I was born on May 3,

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:84%
they'll say what
your Zodiac sign is,

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.510 align:middle line:90%
then they'll type that in.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden the
spreadsheet opens up.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.750 align:middle line:84%
You will do this, this,
this, this, this, and this.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:84%
The computer age has
helped astrology.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Why not the Akashic Records?

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Maybe we
are the computers

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:17.650 align:middle line:90%
for the Akashic Records.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we are the app.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the energetic body?

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: The energetic body
is the frequency that lives

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.820 align:middle line:90%
around--

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it your aura?

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, your aura.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm, absolutely.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And your aura resembles
your inner body as well.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's a direct reflection
of what's going on inside.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
mentioned Edgar Cayce.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A great
American prophet.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yes.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a story that
he was getting on an elevator.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:84%
The door opened and he
sees four people in there

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and does not see any
auras on any of them.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything's dark.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Wow.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.018 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it scared
him because that's never

00:30:59.018 --> 00:31:00.550 align:middle line:90%
happened to him before.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:90%
So he backed off.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:90%
He didn't go in the elevator.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.110 align:middle line:84%
The door closed,
the cable snapped,

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and all four of
those people died.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:17.050 align:middle line:84%
He had a vision that they had
no auras because they were dead.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I'm not really
sure, but I know--

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:27.310 align:middle line:84%
I've heard of stories where
people know like weeks before,

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.620 align:middle line:84%
sometimes months before
that they're going to go,

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:90%
you just don't know how.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.460 align:middle line:84%
But I bet once you
know, like your soul

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:37.690 align:middle line:84%
knows something happens with
your energetic body as well

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:38.770 align:middle line:90%
to prepare.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were chanting
earlier in the program.

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yes.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
kind of frequency

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:46.520 align:middle line:90%
open up all kinds of things?

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely, yeah.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
make you feel better?

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: It depends what
the intention is behind it.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Because we can be chanting
negative things to ourselves

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that will make us
feel worse, but that's

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.360 align:middle line:84%
the idea behind
mantras and whatnot,

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:84%
is the intention behind
the vibrational frequency

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:90%
that you emit.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people who
have a hard time connecting

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.500 align:middle line:84%
to their Akashic Records,
what do you recommend they do?

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Practice.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.725 align:middle line:90%
Let go of expectations.

00:32:14.725 --> 00:32:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you teach them?

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.448 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you?

00:32:19.448 --> 00:32:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Through my
website generally.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is?

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.260 align:middle line:10%
Magicinclined.com.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Magicinclined.com?

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.080 align:middle line:10%
>>MORADI: Mm-hmm.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, cool.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.247 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you train them?

00:32:30.247 --> 00:32:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I do.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And have they come
back to you with good results?

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:35.925 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:32:35.925 --> 00:32:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I feel so honored
that I even get

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.260 align:middle line:84%
to do that and see the
ripple effect of the work

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.858 align:middle line:84%
that we're putting
out into the world.

00:32:46.858 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:90%
It's been really awesome.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find
that when you go out,

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:53.360 align:middle line:84%
you're obsessed with
people's Akashic Records?

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: [LAUGHS] Not at all.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
don't go up to people

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:59.390 align:middle line:84%
and say, I'm going to
do a reading on you?

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Never.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.480 align:middle line:90%
I've never done that.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually quite reluctant.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm always like,
ugh, everyone just

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.380 align:middle line:84%
get to know your own
thing, deal with your own.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is it
constantly changing?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It's in constant
change and growth.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.193 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For the better?

00:33:19.193 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well,
it depends on what

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:21.900 align:middle line:90%
you're doing in the moment.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not always for the better.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the
Akashic Records

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.738 align:middle line:90%
also foretell the future?

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, you can--

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.235 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --of individuals,
of the world events?

00:33:30.235 --> 00:33:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:34.110 align:middle line:84%
There are ways--
like Nostradamus

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:middle line:90%
used it to foresee the future.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And the thing with that is
once you see a future event

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot, things can
change based on the actions

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.390 align:middle line:84%
that the collective
or you individually

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.890 align:middle line:90%
put out from that point on.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's say I go to seek
an answer about-- maybe I

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.690 align:middle line:84%
have a job interview
and I want to see

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:59.050 align:middle line:90%
what would happen with that.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And if I go on with
my life as I am,

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:04.740 align:middle line:84%
that future prediction
could absolutely come true,

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:10.050 align:middle line:84%
but if I change something
to better prepare

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:14.400 align:middle line:84%
or maybe, I don't know,
reroute to a different place,

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.159 align:middle line:84%
that future outcome
will change as well.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you prepare
your work with a client?

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:22.880 align:middle line:90%
How do you start that?

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, I like to get
to know who they are first,

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:32.290 align:middle line:84%
but the first thing
that we do is we go deep

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:34.492 align:middle line:90%
into our root chakra.

00:34:34.492 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
not a psychic right?

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:36.959 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:34:36.959 --> 00:34:38.064 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:34:38.064 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I am not.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.489 align:middle line:90%
So I do--

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I mainly deal
with people's inner energy

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:47.389 align:middle line:90%
and letting them--

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:51.880 align:middle line:84%
teaching them how to
balance that energy so

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:57.210 align:middle line:84%
that they can place it-- they
can reprogram their computer.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I think once you
reprogram your computer

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and you get rid of all
the old data that's

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.550 align:middle line:84%
making it run slower, then
it becomes a lot easier

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:09.510 align:middle line:84%
to start it up and connect
to whatever website

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.910 align:middle line:84%
you're going to, if that's the
Akashic Records or whatnot.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we start.

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who writes
the Akashic Records?

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.190 align:middle line:90%
We do?

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.240 align:middle line:84%
We're all writing
it collectively.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
we make a mistake?

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:28.750 align:middle line:84%
What if we are not happy
with something we've done?

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:30.035 align:middle line:90%
What if we're remorseful?

00:35:30.035 --> 00:35:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you get
that fixed in the book?

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, no,
that'll be there.

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But what you can do is learn
from that mistake and put--

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not do it again.

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.281 align:middle line:84%
Because humans have a tendency
to fall into patterns as you

00:35:46.281 --> 00:35:47.236 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:35:47.236 --> 00:35:49.120 align:middle line:84%
We fall into patterns
really easily

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:90%
because we find comfort in them.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.570 align:middle line:84%
But once we realize that
a certain pattern is

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:59.320 align:middle line:84%
a disadvantage to our
future and our goals,

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.845 align:middle line:84%
then we have the
ability to change

00:36:02.845 --> 00:36:05.790 align:middle line:90%
in that moment going forth.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And again,
the Akashic Records

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.395 align:middle line:84%
start from the
moment you're born?

00:36:10.395 --> 00:36:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the moment
your soul expanded,

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:18.030 align:middle line:84%
when you were a speck of a
soul, that's when it started.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And it builds and grows
through the different lifetimes

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.630 align:middle line:90%
that it goes.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you tell your
clients everything you see?

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you seen
things in their records

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that you said, oh, I'm not
going to tell them about this?

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:32.900 align:middle line:90%
I always--

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lay it out there?

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.740 align:middle line:84%
If I read-- if I do a
reading for someone,

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.012 align:middle line:90%
my job is to be a translator.

00:36:39.012 --> 00:36:40.970 align:middle line:84%
That's all I'm doing, is
I'm just translating--

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you
see good and bad--

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:43.865 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --you say it?

00:36:43.865 --> 00:36:44.665 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Mm-hmm.

00:36:44.665 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:84%
It's for their own good to
receive all the information

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.910 align:middle line:90%
that's coming.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.783 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the Akashic
Records foretell the future?

00:36:52.783 --> 00:36:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Yeah,
you can absolutely

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.800 align:middle line:90%
look into the future.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they may have the
end result of things for you?

00:36:58.875 --> 00:36:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.958 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would be great
to be able to tap into--

00:37:01.958 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I mean, that's
the fun part of it,

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:08.000 align:middle line:84%
is no future is
ever set in stone

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.272 align:middle line:90%
and it can always be altered.

00:37:09.272 --> 00:37:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: George
Norry, you're going

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:14.060 align:middle line:84%
to get this television program
called "Beyond Belief" one day,

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.560 align:middle line:90%
10 years from now.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Or you're going to do
this national radio show.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.070 align:middle line:90%
It would be in there.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.175 align:middle line:90%
It probably was, right?

00:37:20.175 --> 00:37:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:22.113 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely it was.

00:37:22.113 --> 00:37:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I could
have tapped into it,

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.950 align:middle line:90%
I would have known even sooner.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: But it
might have scared you

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and you might not have
followed through either.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.605 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing scares me.

00:37:30.605 --> 00:37:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: [LAUGHS] That's great.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing scares me.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.070 align:middle line:90%
It's magical, isn't it?

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: It is magical.

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.580 align:middle line:90%
The unseen world is so magical.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.362 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason I named
my company what I did.

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the name
of your company is?

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Magic Inclined.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Just like the website, right?

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.452 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:37:50.452 --> 00:37:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Because it is magical--

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And magical doesn't
have to be just

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:02.533 align:middle line:84%
good, but magical is like
this show, "Beyond Belief."

00:38:02.533 --> 00:38:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: It's those spaces
that we are taught not

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.645 align:middle line:90%
to believe in that is magical.

00:38:08.645 --> 00:38:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take us
through a stage.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Somebody contacts
you first time.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.620 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, I give
them the different avenues

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.750 align:middle line:90%
where they could do that.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't offer
readings very often.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.367 align:middle line:90%
Maybe once or twice a year.

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not a lot.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:28.110 align:middle line:84%
My main intention is I
don't want to read for you.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.060 align:middle line:10%
All I want to do
is teach you how

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:33.360 align:middle line:10%
to do it for yourself, because
I feel like that's more powerful

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.867 align:middle line:10%
and the ripple effect of that--

00:38:34.867 --> 00:38:35.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:10%
>>MORADI: --is more valuable
than just going and doing it

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.260 align:middle line:10%
for somebody.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.308 align:middle line:10%
But there are amazing
readers out there, too,

00:38:42.308 --> 00:38:44.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm not saying you
shouldn't get a reading.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just my job
is to teach people

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.890 align:middle line:90%
how to do that on their own.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.650 align:middle line:84%
So I give them different ways
that we can work together,

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:55.360 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a self-paced course
or a freebie or whatever it is.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But I just want
people to feel how--

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:84%
or not feel, but like
know how powerful they are

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.050 align:middle line:84%
and how much they
can accomplish.

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rohini thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.533 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Thank you so
much for having me, George.

00:39:08.533 --> 00:39:09.690 align:middle line:90%
The honor was all mine.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we alter
our Akashic Records?

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: We can
always alter the future

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.800 align:middle line:84%
within our Akashic
Records, but what

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.930 align:middle line:84%
we place in it within
every moment stays there.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So in many
cases, it is what it is?

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yes, absolutely.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.300 align:middle line:90%
It is what it is.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.200 align:middle line:90%
