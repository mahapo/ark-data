00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:10%
You know, we went to Los Angeles
to get this guest for you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:10%
today--

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:10%
Reuben Langdon.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:10%
Reuben, of course,
is a futurist,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:10%
but he's also much
more than that.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:10%
He's a Los Angeles
based stunt person.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:10%
He's a filmmaker.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:10%
He's an actor.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:10%
But more importantly,
in 2013, he

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.910 align:middle line:10%
helped put together the Citizens
Hearing on Disclosure to try

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:10%
to get to the bottom of UFOs.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
He worked with a friend
of ours, Steven Bassett.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.784 align:middle line:84%
That was an amazing
project you did, Reuben.

00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REUBEN LANGDON: Thank you.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that was quite
the undertaking.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, how did you
guys assemble some of those?

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:84%
They were real lawmakers,
too, weren't they right,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:90%
in some cases?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Yeah.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.060 align:middle line:84%
The main Congress members
and the one former Senator,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Mike Gravel, we have
to thank Joe Buchman

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:90%
for getting those folks.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for Joe.

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: I think
he was running

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:90%
for Congress at the time.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.790 align:middle line:90%
I forget.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.052 align:middle line:90%
He was in--

00:01:15.052 --> 00:01:16.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bassett was
trying to do that, too.

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe he was running
in Baltimore or something.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Yeah, and
Bassett was sort of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:90%
in the political arenas.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
But Joe really pulled
through and got them

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:90%
at the last minute.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.614 align:middle line:84%
Because we had a short
window, a very short window,

00:01:25.614 --> 00:01:27.060 align:middle line:90%
to put the whole thing together.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.564 align:middle line:84%
Once we launched the date, it
just kept creeping up on us.

00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's great.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Hey, we're going to talk
about channeling and some

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.753 align:middle line:84%
of the work you're
doing, but tell me,

00:01:35.753 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:84%
what's it like to be
an LA stunt person?

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.337 align:middle line:90%
Ever been hurt?

00:01:39.337 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Oh, yeah.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, many times.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.395 align:middle line:90%
Give me your worst experience.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Let's see.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:90%
I tore my MCL.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: I have sprained
and broken things, dislocated

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:90%
my shoulder.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.496 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some stunt people
have been killed, haven't they?

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Yes, unfortunately.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:84%
There is the danger
factor to it,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
so that's why I guess
not everybody is

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:90%
flocking to be a stunt man.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But I started at a
young age and watched

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Jackie Chan films
and was a huge Bruce Lee fan.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And martial arts was sort
of my doorway into that.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, enjoying the
physical movements.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And watching Jackie
Chan just fascinated me,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to
be just like him.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So I started practicing
and training and hanging

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.104 align:middle line:84%
around the other stunt people
and eventually got my chance

00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to actually work
with Jackie Chan.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you act a double
when you're doing your stunts?

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Sometimes,
yeah, if I'm

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.679 align:middle line:90%
a good match for the lead actor.

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you play the role
of Mick Jagger or John Fogerty,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.270 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: I haven't
doubled those guys,

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.570 align:middle line:90%
but I think now, I could.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:84%
For the film "Avatar," I
doubled the main actor,

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Sam Worthington,
who was Jake Sully.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, I
was doing the motion

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
capture portions of his avatar,
when he was the blue guy.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't have to
look so much alike.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.750 align:middle line:84%
We could cheat with
the technology,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.324 align:middle line:84%
because most of his
physical stuff he was doing,

00:03:09.324 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
he was in the
wheelchair, so there

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:90%
wasn't much stunts going on.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
But then when he was
his Na'vi avatar body,

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.497 align:middle line:84%
then I got to put on the suit
and do all the movements.

00:03:19.497 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, tell me
about this evolution,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:90%
this metamorphosis for you.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood producer,
actor, stunt person.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved into
truth seeking, channeling?

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.014 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:03:31.014 --> 00:03:32.596 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: It was
actually while I was

00:03:32.596 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:90%
working on the film "Avatar."

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:84%
That was a four-year
experience off and on.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't continuous.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's long.

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: A long time
for a film production.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Usually, they're
maybe nine months.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
We were dealing with a
lot of new technologies

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:84%
when it came to the physical
motion capture portions,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle line:90%
at that time, especially.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
computer errors and glitches.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened,
you'd send all of the actors

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:84%
to the back room to sort of
wait for the technical guys

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:90%
to figure things out.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.197 align:middle line:84%
So we had a lot of downtime,
and in our downtime--

00:04:01.197 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:84%
this is when YouTube
was just getting going.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: And myself and
some of the other actors

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
started watching a
lot of YouTube clips.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:90%
You know, we had time to kill.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I stumbled upon Steven Greer's
"Disclosure Project," the 2001

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle line:90%
event.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.660 align:middle line:90%
It was 2005-ish, I think.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which got pushed
by the side because of 9/11.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Right.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I had never even heard
of it, and I saw that.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I saw the film
"Zeitgeist" had come out

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:84%
around that time,
"Loose Change."

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.850 align:middle line:10%
There was a lot of these we
use the term now red pill

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.030 align:middle line:10%
projects, that I was
being red pilled off

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:10%
on the side of "Avatar."

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I was
learning through my work

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:90%
on "Avatar."

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Cameron was having
us study a lot

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.350 align:middle line:90%
of different native cultures.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.549 align:middle line:84%
And the movements for the
Na'vi were based on all

00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
of the different native
cultures from around the world.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was a stickler,
Cameron is, for things like.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.403 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: For the detail.

00:04:52.403 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:90%
The detail was essential.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
On set, there was just
posters and pastings

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:84%
of pictures of all of these
different native cultures

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and their jewelry and
their clothes and garments.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And I had not just Jake Sully,
but I was also performing a lot

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
of just the background Na'vi
movements and performances,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and we were doing
all kinds of stuff.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So I was like taking fish
and cutting them open

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and doing all this
in real life on set,

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:90%
even though it's all CG.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
But just to go
through the movements

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:84%
so they could capture
that movement.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what they needed.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:90%
They needed the movements.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: So I was
getting exposure

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:84%
to all these
indigenous cultures.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And I started learning about
shamanism and indigenous

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:84%
teachings and wisdoms that were
being portrayed as the Na'vi.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the same time,
I'm learning about 9/11.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm learning about UFOs.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And within that window, I had
my own UFO sighting experience

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.421 align:middle line:84%
right in Burbank, California,
in the middle of the day.

00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love Burbank.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: It was like--

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It wasn't
a plane, was it?

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: There was several,
and it had blown my mind.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Because up until then, it was
just all hypothetical for me.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, I had heard
about these cases

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.165 align:middle line:84%
and watching "The
Disclosure Project."

00:06:11.165 --> 00:06:13.955 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.955 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:84%
That was sort of my big
awakening into all his.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in channeling?

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.120 align:middle line:90%
How did that come about?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: That was an
interesting journey.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.259 align:middle line:84%
I had done the research, or
I was doing the research.

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It obviously
interests you, right?

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Yeah, well,
the UFO phenomenon

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:90%
was really a big deal for me.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Because of my sighting,
I really wanted

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.520 align:middle line:90%
to get to the bottom of things.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.506 align:middle line:90%
What did I see?

00:06:37.506 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I really
started diving deep.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:90%
And this was in 2007.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.981 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you got all
these different aspects?

00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: A little
bit of shamanism

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:84%
was still going parallel to
my research into the T stuff.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I had joined one of
Steven Greer's CE5 events

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and saw more lights in the
sky through that experience

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and kept pursuing and
kept pursuing it and then

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
researching and
interviewing contactees,

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
abductees, listening
to your show On Coast.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It helps.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: It was a
huge red pill for me.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually, I stumbled
upon some of the channeling

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.370 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And it really resonated
because of the messages

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:24.450 align:middle line:84%
that were being brought through
were, for the most part,

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:90%
positive messages.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
channel yourself?

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: I don't
in a open sense,

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.006 align:middle line:84%
but I have had the
experience of channeling.

00:07:32.006 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Reuben, when
we talk about channeling,

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:84%
there was an episode that
changed the life of medium

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:90%
and channeler Sheila Gillette.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: When I
was strong enough to be out

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:90%
of the hospital--

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
I was in the hospital for
a month, and I got home.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
About six months
after that, I had

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.190 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of psychic phenomena
happening to me, through me.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Internal, external.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:90%
I could automatic write.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:90%
I could do telekinesis.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I could look at
something and move it.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:90%
I had clairaudience.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I could hear messages
being given to me.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I tranced
spontaneously.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But when Spirit
wanted to speak to me,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I would be sitting in a chair,
and it would physically move,

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:84%
as if someone very
large was shaking it.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And at one
point, I was asked, I'm here.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel me?

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:90%
It was like, whoa.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, you're
shaking the chair.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And I
had my bed levitate

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
at night and some
real unusual things.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:39.620 align:middle line:84%
It was frightening, but deep
down inside of myself, I knew.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was being prepared
for this job I'd asked for.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I started
having the direct voice coming

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:84%
through me, it wasn't
called channeling then.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Trance mediumship, right?

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I was a
medium, a trance medium.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, over the years, I
would not hear all the words.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:90%
But now I do.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's been the
process of my own personal

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.910 align:middle line:84%
growth, of letting go of the
responsibility of feeling like

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I can control the
information, which I cannot.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Or like you have to be right.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is that a big one?

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, yeah.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And that the person is
getting perfect information.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course they are.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people's lives
were changed over these years.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, I took that as a
huge responsibility, as well.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:84%
But then I had to
realize that I'm just

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
the vehicle for this
fabulous information that's

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
being given for this shift of
consciousness on our planet

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:90%
and that I volunteered.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:84%
I stepped up to the
plate and said--

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and of course, the angels
said, OK, you're on.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Reuben,
in your opinion,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:90%
how does channeling work?

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: From the research
and my own experiences,

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I feel that we individually
are all very highly

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:90%
advanced technology.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, the human
biological system.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And we have the ability to
sort of shift frequencies,

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.872 align:middle line:90%
if we look at the world in a--

00:10:17.872 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some of us do.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.907 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Some of us, yeah.

00:10:20.907 --> 00:10:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we all
have the ability.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.054 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
a matter of if we--

00:10:24.054 --> 00:10:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How trained we are.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: If we
train it or not.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.802 align:middle line:84%
Like anything with
stunts, if you train it--

00:10:28.802 --> 00:10:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you can stunt.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:30.910 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: And I trained
for years to do that.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So if we go into a meditative
state-- and I think

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
this is sort of the
doorway into this world.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have accounts
of Tibetan monks

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and, actually, even,
recently, other channelers

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:84%
who hooked themselves
up to the EEG machines

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:84%
that measure brain waves
and brain activity.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually
tell when someone is

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.391 align:middle line:90%
getting into a specific state.

00:11:01.391 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's spikes.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:90%
You can see that.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Yeah.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
There's alpha,
beta, delta, gamma,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and there's all these
different brain wave states.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And it seems,
through the evidence

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen in the research,
that in a very deep state

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:23.690 align:middle line:84%
of trance or meditation,
a meditative m then that's

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:84%
when these channeling
things start to happen,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:90%
when somebody can access--

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.870 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of like a TV, when
you switch the channels.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Hence channeling.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.241 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, are we reaching
them, or are they reaching us?

00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Because just like
your TV explanation,

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.330 align:middle line:84%
networks are beaming
signals to us.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Are they doing that
to us, or are we

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.677 align:middle line:90%
reaching out grabbing them?

00:11:44.677 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: I think
it's a bit of both.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I think just like,
like you said,

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:84%
the TV networks are
beaming the signals out,

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.142 align:middle line:84%
and it's a matter of the
TV set to pick it up.

00:11:54.142 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To pick it up.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: To tune into it.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think the
term channeling is what

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:90%
a great term.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Because we have to tune.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:84%
We have to channel, pick
the channel and tune

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:84%
into that right frequency
to get that message.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
talk about possessions

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:84%
or demonic possessions
in that sense.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.885 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's a valid--

00:12:15.885 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think it's real.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: It's real,
but I also think

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that, maybe on a subconscious
level, that the people who

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:27.170 align:middle line:84%
allow these negative
entities to come through,

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:90%
they're still asking.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
You still have to tune
into that frequency,

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to that broadcast that's
being put out there.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So in my experience
with the little bit

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:47.449 align:middle line:84%
of channeling that I've been
able to sort of tap into,

00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:90%
what you seek is what you find.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So if your intentions are
of pure intentions, of sort

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
of looking for a higher
frequency, a higher vibration,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:84%
then, yes, you can
very likely tap

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:90%
into some higher information.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And simply channeling it in,
meaning you're tuning into it,

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:90%
it's still you.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:90%
It's still the messages.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:84%
You're not being
possessed by any means.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:84%
You're just simply
grabbing that information,

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
digesting it through this
biological technology

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that we have, and
then sharing it

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
with the others in this
reality, in this dimension.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The people
that we channel--

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:84%
loved ones, people
we don't even know--

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:84%
entities, I should say,
we don't even know.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.350 align:middle line:84%
What are they trying to tell
us, in your opinion, Reuben?

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: In my
series, I've interviewed

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:84%
several different entities,
beings, collective energies.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to be the
main sort of throughline--

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.130 align:middle line:84%
the main basis of my
interviews are sort of asking,

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:84%
what are the
constructs of reality,

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:90%
and how does this all work?

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.684 align:middle line:84%
You know, what
are we doing here?

00:13:56.684 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the actual
channel, I think they all--

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.547 align:middle line:84%
the throughline is there,
the constructs of reality.

00:14:03.547 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
do you mean by that?

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Well, for
example, the idea--

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:84%
going back to what
Nikola Tesla had

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:84%
said about when
you can understand

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.700 align:middle line:84%
the constructs of reality being
sort of frequency and vibration

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and that our entire
universe is made up

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.984 align:middle line:90%
of vibrational frequencies.

00:14:21.984 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're beginning to find
that and discover that and even

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.135 align:middle line:90%
record it now.

00:14:26.135 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: And even our
mainstream scientists

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.860 align:middle line:84%
are sort of adopting this idea
of string theory, which they

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
talk about in
string theory, it's

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:84%
like a little string vibrating
at a specific frequency.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And each string
could be a universe.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Exactly, on a micro
as well as the macro level.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the
physicality of this chair,

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.770 align:middle line:84%
it's vibrating at a specific
frequency resonance.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As you are.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: As I am and the cups
and the chairs in the studio.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Everything has its own
resonance frequency.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And as a biological entity,
I'm able to sort of tune

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.960 align:middle line:84%
my resonance to a
specific frequency

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.970 align:middle line:84%
that these other entities exist
on, another plane of existence.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of our UFO researchers
have also sort of theorized

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
that the way they're
able to sort of come

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.290 align:middle line:84%
in and out of our reality is
by shifting their resonance

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.390 align:middle line:84%
frequency instead of traveling
at the speed of light.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
We know that there
would be no way

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:84%
to traverse that
kind of distance.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you start looking at
the world and our reality

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.650 align:middle line:84%
in a vibrational sense,
the channeling idea

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.520 align:middle line:84%
starts to make a
little more sense.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So one of the main messages that
they seem to be speaking about

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:84%
is that's the construct
of our universe.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And we actually have
the ability to tune

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:52.490 align:middle line:84%
our field, our resonance,
to specific frequencies

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:84%
to then have a
more enjoyable life

00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:84%
or to understand the
world in a better way,

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
to have less judgment,
to have more compassion,

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:90%
to have forgiveness.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.279 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are a lot of
people on this planet that

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:08.600 align:middle line:90%
aren't in tune with us.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Correct.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unfortunately.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Well, and that's
its own frequency vibration,

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:90%
its own evolutionary direction.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of us have physical
pain and emotional distress

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:84%
when we tune to those
specific frequencies.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And the main messages coming
through these interviews

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:84%
are techniques and ways
for us to sort of take

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.370 align:middle line:84%
a path of least
resistance that don't

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:90%
require all of this suffering.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
facets of all of that.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
When you look at our
reality, Reuben, is it real?

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Well, in
the physical sense,

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:90%
it definitely seems real.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.270 align:middle line:84%
We use our five senses, and
we can taste, touch, and feel

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.410 align:middle line:90%
different things.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
But on another level, what
scientists are discovering

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:84%
in the quantum sense,
there's a massive space

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:90%
between the atoms.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of made up
of air and nothingness.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that makes
it real is our perception of it.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
we're in a dream?

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.314 align:middle line:84%
All of us are in
this huge dream.

00:17:20.314 --> 00:17:22.704 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.704 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Through
my interviews,

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:24.953 align:middle line:90%
that's what they say.

00:17:24.953 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:84%
They say that this reality
is no more real or less

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:90%
real than our actual dreams.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
is the density.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:84%
The physicalization
of this realm

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.810 align:middle line:84%
is a heavier, dense realm
than the dream sense.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whoever's dreaming
this, don't wake up yet.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not over.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are some who believe
that what we are living in

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:84%
is a holographic
universe, that it

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.220 align:middle line:84%
is a creation of some kind
of a digital situation.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Elon Musk.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.240 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: There's sort of
a philosophic concept that

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.430 align:middle line:10%
a sufficiently advanced
civilization will be able

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.410 align:middle line:10%
to create a simulation--

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.082 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've
answered this before?

00:18:08.082 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ELON MUSK: I've had so
many simulation discussions,

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:90%
it's crazy.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:10%
Because--

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.099 align:middle line:10%
>>MUSK: In fact,
it got to the point

00:18:14.099 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:10%
where, basically,
every conversation was

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.182 align:middle line:10%
the AI/simulation conversation.

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And my brother and
I finally agreed

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.972 align:middle line:84%
that we would ban
such conversations

00:18:22.972 --> 00:18:24.180 align:middle line:90%
if we were ever in a hot tub.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.925 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.925 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Because that really
kills the magic.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.585 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We're
not in a hot tub.

00:18:30.585 --> 00:18:31.507 align:middle line:90%
So the idea is right?

00:18:31.507 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:10%
Any sufficiently
advanced civilization

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:10%
would create, could
create, a simulation

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:10%
that's like our existence?

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And so the theory follows that
maybe we're in the simulation.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Have you thought about this?

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MUSK: A lot.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Even in hot tubs.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So much so that it had to
be banned from a hot tub.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.404 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.404 --> 00:18:56.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not the sexiest
conversation.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Are we in?

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Are we in?

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MUSK: In my mind,
the strongest argument

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:84%
for us being in a simulation,
probably being a simulation,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.137 align:middle line:90%
I think is the following.

00:19:09.137 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
40 years ago, we had Pong,
like two rectangles and a dot.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:90%
That was what games were.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.472 align:middle line:84%
Now, 40 years later, we have
photorealistic, 3D simulations

00:19:24.472 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:84%
with millions of people
playing simultaneously,

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's getting
better every year.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And soon, we'll have virtual
reality, augmented reality.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:84%
If you assume any rate
of improvement at all,

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
then the games will become
indistinguishable from reality.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Just indistinguishable.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Even if that rate of
advancement drops by 1,000

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:84%
from what it is right
now, then you just

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:84%
say, OK, well,
let's imagine it's

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.620 align:middle line:84%
10,000 years in the
future, which is nothing

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:90%
in the evolutionary scale.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's a given that we're
clearly on a trajectory

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:84%
to have games that are
indistinguishable from reality.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And those games could be
played on any set-top box

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.430 align:middle line:90%
or on a PC or whatever.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And there would probably be
billions of such computers

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:90%
with set-top boxes.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:25.890 align:middle line:84%
It would seem to follow that the
odds that we're in base reality

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.934 align:middle line:90%
is one in billions.

00:20:28.934 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what's wrong
with that argument.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Is the answer yes?

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MUSK: The argument
is probably--

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there a
flaw in that argument?

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what the error in--

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.258 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, the
argument makes sense.

00:20:41.258 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So the assumption, then, is
that somebody beat us to it

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:90%
and this is a game?

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MUSK: No.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.930 align:middle line:84%
No, there's a one
in billions chance

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:90%
that this is base reality.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.149 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MUSK: Well, I think
it's one in billions.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.780 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:03.984 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be clearly
what it suggests.

00:21:03.984 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I
mean, arguably, we

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.290 align:middle line:90%
should hope that that's true.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:12.150 align:middle line:10%
Because otherwise, if
civilization stops advancing,

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:10%
then that may be due to
some calamitous event that

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:10%
erases civilization.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we should be hopeful
that this is a simulation,

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:90%
because otherwise--

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Because they could reboot it.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MUSK: Well,
otherwise, either we're

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
going to create
simulations that are

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
indistinguishable from
reality or civilization

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:90%
will cease to exist.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think the
questioner, Reuben,

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:84%
was giving better answers
than Elon Musk in that case.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: I agree.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:84%
In the channeling sessions
and the interviews I've had,

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
they all talk about the
holographic universe.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.140 align:middle line:84%
That is how they
perceive reality.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of what
they teach, and I agree.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.210 align:middle line:84%
We have guys like Elon Musk, and
our most famous scientists now

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.660 align:middle line:84%
are sort of also coming
to that conclusion.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And in that idea,
in that concept,

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.670 align:middle line:84%
things are a little
more malleable.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They're not as physically
dense as we would initially

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:90%
perceive them to be.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this kind
of holographic world

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:84%
that we may be
living in, if that's

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:90%
the case, who's controlling it?

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Well, we are.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:10%
What they say is we are--

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:10%
another version of us,
sort of our higher selves

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.919 align:middle line:10%
or an oversoul.

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
different terms that

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:10%
are sort of thrown out there.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:84%
But there's a version of us
that actually is creating

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:38.640 align:middle line:90%
this simulation, this hologram.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have sort of become
disconnected from that version

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.380 align:middle line:84%
in order to experience this
reality in the way we're

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:90%
experiencing it now.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.500 align:middle line:84%
It would be a whole
different ballgame

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.690 align:middle line:84%
if we were aware and knew
and had that connection

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:55.560 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like when
you play a video game,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:84%
if you knew the
maps and if you knew

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:84%
where all the secret weapons
and all the secret abilities

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and you had all the power, then
what fun would the game be?

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So this not knowing, this
disconnection but yet

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:84%
connected-- you're
still playing the game--

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that is sort of the
experience we're having here.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Mandela effect.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Yes.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a very
bizarre situation.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.560 align:middle line:84%
The phrase was coined by a
researcher several years ago,

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.730 align:middle line:90%
which kind of depicts--

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.660 align:middle line:84%
well, you tell me
what you think it is.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Well, I brought
this up, too, in my interviews,

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:90%
and I ask about it.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And they describe time being
as malleable as anything else.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.370 align:middle line:90%
The only true event is the now.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
that exists is now.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Anything in the future
is hypothetical.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:90%
It's malleable.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not set in stone.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.037 align:middle line:84%
Anything in the
past is the same.

00:24:00.037 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:90%
It's just a concept.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:90%
It's an idea.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.030 align:middle line:84%
The way we physically
measure the future

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.370 align:middle line:84%
is the same way we can
physically measure the past--

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:90%
we can't.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
exists is the now.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So, with that said,
the past is just

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:90%
as malleable as the future.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And as we shift our current
moment, from moment to moment

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:84%
to moment to moment, and
every second shifting billions

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.440 align:middle line:90%
of times, then the past--

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:84%
we align with a different
past version of ourselves.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, sort of making
sense of the Mandela effect,

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
thinking that some of
us have experienced,

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:84%
you know, the Berenstein
Bears, or the Berenstain Bears.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So depending on where our
current vibrational frequency,

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:84%
going back to the
idea of frequencies,

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:52.620 align:middle line:84%
what past events align
in a linear sense,

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.950 align:middle line:84%
in a third dimensional reality,
what align with the present

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:57.750 align:middle line:90%
now moment.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, with
the Mandela effect,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:84%
based on the late South African
President Nelson Mandela,

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:84%
what happened during that days,
and the reason why they coined

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:84%
that phrase, was
that people thought--

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.270 align:middle line:90%
he's dead now.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.080 align:middle line:84%
But people thought
then he was dead

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:90%
when he was very much alive.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And they felt as if they
experienced that effect.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were
convinced they knew

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.682 align:middle line:90%
he had died when he never did.

00:25:25.682 --> 00:25:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Right, yeah.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And since then, we've
had example after example

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:90%
after example.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:84%
If you ever just
Google Mandela effect,

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.170 align:middle line:84%
you get the latest,
greatest updates of

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:84%
did you know that in "Star
Wars," instead of saying, Luke,

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm your father, he says,
no, I am your father.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it as,
Luke, I'm your father.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, James
Earl Jones even

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.470 align:middle line:84%
did an interview
saying, no, I said Luke.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But in any version
that you find,

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:58.010 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a VHS
tape or a YouTube clip,

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:84%
he's going to say,
no, I'm your father.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So that is just one
of many examples.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that happen?

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Well, again, sort
of the explanation that sort

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:84%
of makes sense in my

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:10.928 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your world.

00:26:10.928 --> 00:26:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: --in my world is
that because we're constantly

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.970 align:middle line:84%
shifting our now
moment, we're now

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:84%
aligning with a past that is
more in alignment with the now.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, five years
ago, in that now moment,

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:84%
my memories of how
I experienced that

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.770 align:middle line:84%
was a different sort of
frequency or vibration,

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:38.520 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't align
with that sense.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And some of us are experiencing
that, and some of us

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.640 align:middle line:90%
remember it the other way.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's very individual.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
explain deja vu?

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Because that's another
bizarre phenomenon.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.790 align:middle line:84%
People just believe
they anticipate

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.100 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen
before it happens.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Right,
so like in dreams.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:84%
We experience deja vu type
events when, sometimes, we've

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.229 align:middle line:84%
had a dream or we're
in a place that it's

00:27:05.229 --> 00:27:07.020 align:middle line:84%
the first time we've
physically been there,

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.180 align:middle line:90%
but yet, it feels so familiar.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, going back to the
frequency and vibration

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.150 align:middle line:90%
analogy of how things exist.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain
moments or situations.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So in these
interviews, they talk

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:84%
about how everything
in this room,

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
for example, would be
a specific frequency,

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.680 align:middle line:90%
a specific vibration.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.330 align:middle line:84%
It would have its own
specific timestamp.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So nowhere else in the
entire universe is there you

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and me sitting here with
these specific chairs

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.180 align:middle line:84%
with our cups of water
and in the studio

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:90%
here at the Gaia studios.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a very unique
frequency vibration experience.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you add up and when
you have a calculator that

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:57.380 align:middle line:84%
can combine all of the different
elements in this now moment,

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
then we can revisit
this now moment

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.350 align:middle line:84%
through maybe some advanced
civilization has technology

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:84%
that can calculate,
some AI that can

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.510 align:middle line:84%
bring in all of the
different elements that

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:90%
are in this moment.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And when they play it back
through a specific player,

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:84%
then they can actually phase
into existence of this moment.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So deja vu might
be something where

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:84%
we're traveling to a place
or a time in our daily lives

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and we're hitting that
frequency vibration that

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.150 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to
another experience

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:36.036 align:middle line:84%
that we've had in the same
frequency and vibration.

00:28:36.036 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Reuben, on one
of our Gaia programs,

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.400 align:middle line:84%
a woman by the name of
Kim Carlsberg talked

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:45.470 align:middle line:84%
about her abduction case and
her alien hybrid situation.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.135 align:middle line:90%
Truly strange.

00:28:48.135 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KIM CALRSBERG: I truly
believe that there are so

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.300 align:middle line:84%
many concerns about what we're
doing with the nuclear weapons,

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.380 align:middle line:84%
with just trashing the planet
in general, overpopulation.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:90%
You know, the hybrids.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:90%
I know that there are some here.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I've come in contact
with some here.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I know that my children
don't live here.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:84%
My daughter, April, speaks
with me telepathically now

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.440 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:84%
She says that they live on a
craft in the Pleiades system,

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:84%
but they no longer have
the need for a home planet.

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So I know that there's
work to be done,

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and they're here to
help, as bad as it is.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, you get drugged
and you get knocked out.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:84%
But the end result is
I have amazing, amazing

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.845 align:middle line:90%
hybrid children.

00:29:36.845 --> 00:29:38.720 align:middle line:84%
They've taken the best
of all of these races,

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and they've come up
with these physically

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:47.954 align:middle line:84%
gorgeous, telepathic,
intelligent beings.

00:29:47.954 --> 00:29:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I hope that they
end up being here

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:90%
to help us get through this.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, what do you
think of that, Reuben?

00:29:53.378 --> 00:29:56.300 align:middle line:84%
She actually thinks she's
communicating telepathically

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:84%
with a child of hers
who was a hybrid.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Yeah I've gone deep
into the hybrid subjects with--

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange.

the hybridization programs,

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:13.350 align:middle line:90%

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And probably the
most famous ones

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:84%
are with the grays, of
the Zeta Reticuli beings,

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:25.310 align:middle line:84%
sort of standard Paul-like ET
that we see in our mass media.

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, it
either happened to her

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.010 align:middle line:84%

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: They're

00:30:41.818 --> 00:30:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And for them all to be sort of
delusional or psychotic would

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.250 align:middle line:84%
mean we have some major
issues with our planet

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:84%
right now, because
that's just too many to--

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you have
1,000 people talking

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.930 align:middle line:84%
1,000 people, and only
10 of them are accurate,

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.494 align:middle line:84%

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.610 align:middle line:84%

They're not on medications.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: They

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:13.680 align:middle line:90%
They're not selling books.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are, but
you know, that's--

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.910 align:middle line:90%
the most--

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not going to
sell a lot of books like that.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:19.798 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to get rich.

00:31:19.798 --> 00:31:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Exactly.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:24.590 align:middle line:84%
For people who haven't
doven into this,

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:28.610 align:middle line:84%
it's just too far out there for
them to even dive into this.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:33.020 align:middle line:84%
But the hybrid phenomenon,
based on my interviews,

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.010 align:middle line:90%
it does seem to be real.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And it does seem to
be created to help

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:84%
bridge the future contact that
we're sort of set to have.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.490 align:middle line:84%
The way they put it
is we are destined

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.200 align:middle line:84%
to connect to our
galactic families.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And through all
of the experiences

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:53.120 align:middle line:84%
that so many people on
this planet have had,

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:90%
we're going to get there.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:58.360 align:middle line:84%
But through the hybridization
and creating these children

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.210 align:middle line:84%
is sort of a bridge
to get to that step.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because
when we first made contact

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:08.990 align:middle line:84%
with these children
and when they

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.240 align:middle line:90%
start to appear on the planet--

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.120 align:middle line:84%
this is the story
that I've been told,

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.740 align:middle line:84%
is that they will
physically start

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.330 align:middle line:90%
to manifest on this planet.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they going to
breed here and take over?

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a plan
to get rid of us.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Some people who are
sort of in the fear-based ideas

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:30.320 align:middle line:84%
believe that, that that is
a possibility, that they're

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.870 align:middle line:90%
bred to take over the planet.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:37.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
form of evolution.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Even as unnatural
as it sounds, I

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.190 align:middle line:84%
believe it's a natural form
of evolution to bridge us

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:49.070 align:middle line:84%
into a new civilization
where we can be interwoven

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:90%
with our galactic families.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And we need this sort of
bridge to get us there.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Because if, all of
a sudden, aliens

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:04.400 align:middle line:84%
or ETs from another
dimension or another galaxy

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.020 align:middle line:84%
showed up on the
White House lawn--

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.510 align:middle line:84%
you've talked about this in
many of your other interviews--

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.100 align:middle line:90%
we'd shoot them out of the sky.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'd attempt
to, absolutely,

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.650 align:middle line:90%
even if it tried to get close.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.650 align:middle line:84%
God knows what would
happen when they retaliate.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.191 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Right,
and we and we would

00:33:17.191 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:84%
believe that they're hostile,
even if they weren't,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:90%
if they just showed up.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.227 align:middle line:90%
We have this in our movies.

00:33:22.227 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:90%
We have this all over the place.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:27.437 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of fear going on,

00:33:27.437 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:84%
because we wouldn't
know what they're doing,

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:30.070 align:middle line:90%
what they're up to.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.340 align:middle line:90%
We would be guessing.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
a child that has

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:84%
already a telepathic
communication

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:39.560 align:middle line:84%
to these other beings and
if they're our own child,

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.700 align:middle line:84%
if they look like us--
maybe a little different.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.870 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
they're our own child.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:50.130 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to be as quick
to throw them under the bus,

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.290 align:middle line:84%
because they're our
own physical DNA.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:90%
They're not their own children.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to scrutinize them

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:02.520 align:middle line:84%
to scientific dissection and
all of these sort of things.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.580 align:middle line:84%
If an alien were to show up,
if a little gray dude showed up

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.320 align:middle line:84%
in the studio here, we would
probably all be freaking out.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It'd be
a great interview.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.388 align:middle line:90%
I would do that.

00:34:12.388 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Well,
maybe that's coming.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would do that.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: But in
the meantime, we

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:20.130 align:middle line:84%
have our children who
share some genetic makeup

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.600 align:middle line:90%
from these other civilizations.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.000 align:middle line:84%
They also share our
own genetic makeup.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we're going to
be a little more careful

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.991 align:middle line:84%
and not dissect them and
not pry them apart and all

00:34:30.991 --> 00:34:32.699 align:middle line:84%
these sorts of things
that would probably

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:35.670 align:middle line:84%
happen if another being
from another civilization

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.889 align:middle line:90%
were to show up in our reality.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Just look at what we do with
different animal species that

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:90%
are even new or different.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.761 align:middle line:84%
You know, we want to
poke and prod and--

00:34:44.761 --> 00:34:46.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Genetically modify
them and everything else.

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:49.086 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Right, and
figure out what's there.

00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And we wouldn't
do that, I think,

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.429 align:middle line:90%
if it was our own children.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:53.540 align:middle line:84%
We'd be a little more
protective of our children.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So the way it's been
explained to me,

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.800 align:middle line:84%
the hybridization
programs are a sort

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.930 align:middle line:84%
of step in the
direction of contact

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and making contact
in a way that's

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:07.865 align:middle line:84%
going to be a little
easier on the populace.

00:35:07.865 --> 00:35:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Reuben, tell me

back, as I mentioned,

getting into the UFO

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:30.210 align:middle line:10%
research, the channeling,
I started diving deeper

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:34.260 align:middle line:10%
into my research with
different cultures,

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.310 align:middle line:10%

00:36:03.165 --> 00:36:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that's truly what
telepathic communication--

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:11.790 align:middle line:84%
when empaths talk
about telepathy and ETs

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:17.160 align:middle line:84%
having telepathic communication,
I think that's what it is.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So going down this
journey, I've realized

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.310 align:middle line:84%
that there's a
parallel coincidence

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.680 align:middle line:84%
with the channeling, with the
UFO work, with everything.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not separate.

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:28.620 align:middle line:90%
They're interconnected.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do shamans need
these mood-altering drugs

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.770 align:middle line:90%

>>LANGDON: I wouldn't

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.630 align:middle line:84%

different shamans.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Some shamans who work
with different medicines,

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.844 align:middle line:90%
you know there's--

00:36:42.844 --> 00:36:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe they like it.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.301 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Yeah, well, there's
the Native Americans who

00:36:46.301 --> 00:36:50.661 align:middle line:84%
work with the peyote, and
there's the shamans from Peru

00:36:50.661 --> 00:36:51.660 align:middle line:90%
who work with Ayahuasca.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.451 align:middle line:84%
But then there's a lot
of different shamans

00:36:53.451 --> 00:36:55.020 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, as well,
the Q'ero shamans,

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.840 align:middle line:84%
who don't work with any
mind-altering substances

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.080 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And actually, many
across the world

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:07.050 align:middle line:84%
don't engage in any sort
of entheogic substances.

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:09.120 align:middle line:90%
So it just depends on the tribe.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:14.520 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the culture
and if that's readily

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.030 align:middle line:90%
used in their practices.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And it can be helpful, I think,
especially for us in the West

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.890 align:middle line:84%
here, who have not
had-- for myself,

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:33.670 align:middle line:84%
not having been in an intuitive
sort of situation lightly.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But we're inundated with our
technologies and our phones

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and the Starbucks and
McDonald's and the typical way

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.260 align:middle line:90%
of Western life.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.150 align:middle line:84%

we used to, maybe,

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:48.190 align:middle line:84%
in some of these
indigenous cultures.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:52.650 align:middle line:84%
So using entheogens
as a permission

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:56.010 align:middle line:84%
slip to access the
states of being.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:59.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a permission
slip that we can use.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:00.840 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And through my
research, the shamans,

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
these indigenous cultures
who practice with medicine

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.740 align:middle line:84%
or without the medicines,
they correlate.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The teachings correlate
exactly with what

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning through
these channelings,

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.960 align:middle line:90%
through our ET contact.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Since the dawn
of modern humans,

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.810 align:middle line:84%
every culture in every region
practiced what some would call

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:38.560 align:middle line:90%
shamanism.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.530 align:middle line:84%
This mystical
practice is scarcely

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:90%
understood, but not forgotten.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:48.060 align:middle line:10%
In the 1960s, amateur
ethnomycologist Gordon Wasson

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.220 align:middle line:10%
wrote his first
book titled "Soma--

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.550 align:middle line:10%
Divine Mushroom of
Immortality" after noticing

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.400 align:middle line:10%
the indigenous mushroom
culture in Siberia.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Siberian shamans would
collect the fly agaric,

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.880 align:middle line:84%
or amanita muscaria, mushrooms
and either dried and ate them

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.760 align:middle line:84%
or would feed them to reindeer
and drink the urine to get

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.460 align:middle line:90%
the effects free of nausea.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Because this culture neighbored
ancient Indian culture,

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Wasson surmised that
the amanita muscaria

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:17.690 align:middle line:84%
mushroom must be the lost
ingredient of the drink soma.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:20.070 align:middle line:10%
Soma was the sacred and
psychedelic beverage

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.660 align:middle line:10%
of ancient India.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.370 align:middle line:10%
But how could this
mushroom have ended up

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.670 align:middle line:10%
in a foreign
religious sacrament?

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:28.230 align:middle line:84%
This drove Wasson to
dig deeper to discover

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.990 align:middle line:90%
what shamanism truly is.

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:36.060 align:middle line:10%
>> The term itself came from
the Siberian cultures and was

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.210 align:middle line:10%
brought into English
through Russian and German,

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.150 align:middle line:10%
and people started to recognize
it as a phenomenon that was

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.540 align:middle line:10%
found in many parts of the
world and started applying it

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:48.570 align:middle line:10%
to Native American practices
and to Australian practices

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:49.680 align:middle line:10%
and things like this.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.720 align:middle line:84%
What really is a
shaman kind of depends

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.430 align:middle line:90%
on the perspective we take.

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:56.910 align:middle line:10%
>> So the shaman is like
a spiritual bounty hunter.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:04.260 align:middle line:10%
He or she deliberately
induces these altered states,

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.510 align:middle line:10%
with drugs or other means.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But then, they just don't
sit there and have the trip.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:14.400 align:middle line:84%

navigate in that world.

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And I have heard of and
witnessed maybe a little bit

00:40:53.370 --> 00:41:03.300 align:middle line:84%
of abusiveness, especially with
the entheogens and the shamans

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.520 align:middle line:90%
practicing with that.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Just like with anything,
you have to be very careful.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:14.010 align:middle line:84%
If the ego takes
over, then the message

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:17.392 align:middle line:84%
of oneness and
connectiveness gets lost

00:41:17.392 --> 00:41:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and you have all
sorts of problems.

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So I don't recommend anybody
to run out and go drink

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.480 align:middle line:84%
some Ayahuasca today, because
that could be very dangerous.

that it's highly intelligent
per the individual.

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:18.370 align:middle line:84%

it truly is the case.

So many people join
together in the circle.

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And depending on what's
needed for the room,

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.640 align:middle line:84%
for the individual, then they'll
bring through specific energies

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:09.150 align:middle line:84%
to help that person with
whatever they're dealing with.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
like exorcists?

>>LANGDON: In a way, yes.

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:14.927 align:middle line:84%
I've actually, in a

00:44:14.927 --> 00:44:16.260 align:middle line:90%

>>LANGDON: I would say so.

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.450 align:middle line:90%
What I saw in my journey--

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and this goes to sort
of validating the idea

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:32.790 align:middle line:90%
of a demon or a demonic energy.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Before it even showed up, I
could feel it in the room.

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:37.154 align:middle line:90%
I could feel this presence.

00:44:37.154 --> 00:44:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This evil presence?

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: This
evil, dark presence.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:42.524 align:middle line:84%
And I knew immediately
it was there.

00:44:42.524 --> 00:44:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I sort of started to
have a conversation

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:45.369 align:middle line:90%
with it and I said--

00:44:45.369 --> 00:44:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With the entity?

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: With the presence.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.910 align:middle line:84%
I could feel it, and I sort of
said, you're not welcome here.

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.280 align:middle line:84%
We're all trying to do
some healing work here,

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.260 align:middle line:90%
and I'm sorry, but you're just--

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.060 align:middle line:90%
please go away.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.729 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there a
person who was possessed?

00:44:59.729 --> 00:45:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Soon after
that, I felt that presence,

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:03.540 align:middle line:90%
I looked across the room.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was filming this
event for my documentary.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And I looked across the
room, and I saw the shaman

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:10.730 align:middle line:90%
working on this gentleman.

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:13.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, hovering over him
and sort of doing some chants.

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Touching
him and stuff like?

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Not really?

>>LANGDON: Chanting.

00:45:16.163 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:84%
More sort of chants
and doing some things.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:23.436 align:middle line:90%
And I saw this black shadow.

00:45:23.436 --> 00:45:24.810 align:middle line:84%
That's all I could
describe that.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a shadow person?

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.605 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Not a physical
person, but just this shadow.

00:45:29.605 --> 00:45:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a blob?

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Like a blob, almost.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:32.330 align:middle line:90%
It was hard.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:34.860 align:middle line:84%
The room's dark, so your
eyes play tricks on you.

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.800 align:middle line:84%
But my eyes were open, and
I saw this shadow come out

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.790 align:middle line:90%
of this person.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.797 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it the ectoplasm?

00:45:41.797 --> 00:45:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Possibly.

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Again, I was in a
trance-altered state,

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:48.570 align:middle line:84%
so I could have just
been imagining things.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.360 align:middle line:90%
But what I saw, what I felt--

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I felt it before and then I saw
them come out of this person.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw it
go into the shaman.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It went
into the shaman?

00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: It went
into the shaman.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.241 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, did it affect the
shaman when it went into him?

00:46:02.241 --> 00:46:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: The shaman, then, his
face, what I could see-- again,

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:06.540 align:middle line:90%
it was dark.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He shapeshifted.

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: His face, it
looked like he aged 80 years.

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly?

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:12.245 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Instantly.

00:46:12.245 --> 00:46:15.420 align:middle line:84%
He just turned super
old, and he started

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.340 align:middle line:90%
coughing and convulsing.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And he went over to the altar.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you don't
think it's an act, do you?

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: No.

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from what I could
see and what I could feel.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And well, then the shaman
went over to the altar,

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.960 align:middle line:90%
and then he had a major purge.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So with Ayahuasca, you
purge out these energies.

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:39.266 align:middle line:84%
And he just puked in the
bucket and just let it all out.

00:46:39.266 --> 00:46:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who's
watching the shaman?

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:41.920 align:middle line:90%
His tribes people?

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: No.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's sort of
doing his own thing.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in the
room is taking part.

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And many people are
on their own journeys.

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:54.970 align:middle line:90%
I had a little bit.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Not that much, so I could
still perform and film.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:00.360 align:middle line:90%
But I experienced all this.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.930 align:middle line:90%
You know, tried to film it.

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:03.050 align:middle line:90%
It was so mind-blowing.

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you in shock?

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: I was mesmerized.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Not in shock, but just
definitely mesmerized.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you expect this?

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: No.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.240 align:middle line:84%
No, I had not
expected any of this.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
day-- so we shared.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.520 align:middle line:84%
A big part of the journey
and the experience

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.670 align:middle line:90%
is we share our experiences.

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Individually, we sort of go
around and share what happened.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, before I
even got to share what I saw,

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.190 align:middle line:84%
the gentleman said, yeah, I
felt this massive energy leave

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:35.850 align:middle line:84%
my body had sort of been
in there for a long time.

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And the shaman also said,
yeah, as I was working on you,

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.770 align:middle line:90%
I felt that, and we cleared it.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.360 align:middle line:90%
We got it out of the room.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And after that
experience, in my sense,

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I felt like there was no more
of that heavy, dense energy that

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.040 align:middle line:90%
was in the room.

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.339 align:middle line:84%

The channeling portion
of it, to me, is amazing.

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:29.220 align:middle line:84%
To be able to deal with
those from the other side,

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.130 align:middle line:84%
