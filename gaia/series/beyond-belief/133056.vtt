Technological University.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:84%
He conducts research and sky
monitoring and cosmology,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:90%
among other topics.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Robert is a co-creator

of the Day website, which

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:84%
delivers images of the galaxy to
an average of a million viewers

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:90%

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:10%
Robert discusses the wonders
of space and its mysteries

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:10%
today on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But welcome
to the program.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT NEMIROFF: Thank you.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's good
to have you with us.

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And what a fascinating
area that you work in.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more exciting
than-- to me-- space.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Since I was a little kid a
member of a telescope club.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would go out in
my Detroit winter days,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:84%
20 degrees out at night,
looking at the stars.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And I will always remember
when I put my little four inch

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.570 align:middle line:84%
refractor telescope on
Saturn and actually saw

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:90%
the rings around that planet.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.840 align:middle line:90%
And I was hooked ever since.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.159 align:middle line:84%
So it must be
fascinating for you, too.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: I've been interested
in astronomy and space

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:10%
since I was little, too.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.100 align:middle line:84%
I was given a four
inch telescope.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I think it was three
inch telescope.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't look
at it from the outside

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:10%
because we used
to take it outside

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.127 align:middle line:10%
and I had an old
English sheepdog.

00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:50.709 align:middle line:10%
And the old English
sheepdog would not

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:10%
stay away from the telescope.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't point it--

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It kept
knocking it over.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: Yeah.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.152 align:middle line:10%
It kept knocking me.

00:01:55.152 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was so happy about
everything being outside at

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:90%
night.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.022 align:middle line:84%
But then I reset
it up in my room.

00:02:00.022 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
interested in space.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I've always been interested
in reading newspaper articles

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:90%
and watching NASA on TV.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:90%
I've been so lucky.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself so lucky
to be a part of that now.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then Jupiter.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
You could see there are four
of Jupiter's many moons.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.680 align:middle line:90%
Those things popped out.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:90%
It was truly remarkable.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I was a
little disappointed

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:84%
in looking at Mars,
only because I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
expected to see little green
men hobbling around the planet.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
But I was never
able to find them.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Yeah.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.140 align:middle line:84%
You can see the bands,
with a small telescope,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.514 align:middle line:84%
you can see the
bands of Jupiter.

00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And you can slightly see
different shaded regions

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:90%
on Mars.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's not as spectacular
as some of the NASA images.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So NASA sends like spacecraft
to Mars, and with really high

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.789 align:middle line:90%
resolution, amazing stuff.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to see
that with a small telescope.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
As long as you know
that, it's really cool

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to think that you can
see the orange color.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.812 align:middle line:84%
Through a really good telescope,
you can see the ice caps.

00:02:55.812 --> 00:02:58.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing that you can
see this with your own eyes.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we at
a point now where

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:84%
the theories of
planetary evolution, how

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:84%
they were formed, how
solar systems were formed,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
that it's pretty
accurate or are we

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.500 align:middle line:84%
still learning some
dramatic things?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: Well we
know many things.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very rapidly
changing science,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:84%
because we've
discovered-- humanity,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.410 align:middle line:84%
through many missions,
have discovered

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
many exoplanets, planets
orbiting other stars,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:90%
only in the past 10, 20 years.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Before that, they
were just speculation.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.772 align:middle line:84%
And as we've discovered
some, we just

00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:84%
realize that things are slightly
different than we thought.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:84%
They're not completely
different than we thought.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
But different mechanisms
and different ways

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
that planets move around
different systems and even that

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:84%
bears back to our
own solar system,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:90%
how our own solar system formed.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.950 align:middle line:84%
As we learn about
other solar systems,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:90%
we learn about our own.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So you might say it's a
revolution in thought,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:84%
but much of the physics
was there already.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:84%
We just know how it
applies better now.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is
though-- because I'm

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.420 align:middle line:84%
convinced that you knew and
I knew as boys-- that there

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:90%
were other planets out there.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:90%
We knew this.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Of course, science
never found it.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's backing up
things that we suspected.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.639 align:middle line:84%
How did we know that as kids,
because we had that feeling?

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: Because we
watched "Star Trek."

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.263 align:middle line:90%
And they went there.

00:04:11.263 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:90%
And it just seems reasonable.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And you know the space
community knew it too.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.736 align:middle line:84%
NASA knew it or
they wouldn't have

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:18.642 align:middle line:84%
spent so much money trying to
look for these kinds of things.

00:04:18.642 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:84%
They were pretty sure there
were planets out there orbiting

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:84%
other stars, or they wouldn't
have spent so much money trying

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:90%
to find them.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
It would have been a bigger
story if they didn't find any.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.978 align:middle line:84%
Like oh, my god, this is
the only solar system,

00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
the only planetary
system around.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So that makes even less
sense than discovering

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.480 align:middle line:90%
lots of planetary systems.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we assume
that almost every star

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
might have planets around
it or is that not the case?

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.005 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: I think most stars
that have planets around it.

00:04:44.005 --> 00:04:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Most of them do.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.385 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
billions of stars.

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Yes.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
There is lots of stars
in the night sky.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Thousands you can see, and
with a telescope millions,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and with big telescopes
out in space, billions.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, pretty much all
of them have planets.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the complexity
of what's out there

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:90%
in the universe is the same.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I've always called it
the primordial soup.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So the elements that you find on
this planet-- gold and hydrogen

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and oxygen-- I think
these elements are all

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.102 align:middle line:90%
over the place in the universe.

00:05:18.102 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Absolutely.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:90%
We see these elements.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:84%
These elements absorb
certain colors of light.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at nebula,
when we look at distant stars,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.722 align:middle line:84%
we see the exact
same elements that we

00:05:28.722 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:84%
see absorbing things in the
laboratory here on Earth.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:84%
They have the same patterns of
absorption in distant stars,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:90%
in distant nebula.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So we know there's nitrogen and
mostly hydrogen and helium out

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when quasars were
discovered-- maybe 50 years ago

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.310 align:middle line:84%
or so now-- there were
some strange lines

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:90%
they didn't understand.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that these
were regular hydrogen lines,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.325 align:middle line:84%
mostly, but the quasar was
moving away so quickly,

00:05:54.325 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:84%
we were so far away, that
that's why it put them

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.360 align:middle line:90%
in regions we don't understand.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.697 align:middle line:90%
And here's another cool thing.

00:05:59.697 --> 00:06:01.280 align:middle line:84%
We look at the sun
and you would think

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
that we would understand
all the absorption lines,

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:84%
all of the-- the sun has what's
called continuum radiation.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly-- well,
it appears white,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.837 align:middle line:90%
but it's mostly yellowish green.

00:06:12.837 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's all these
absorption lines

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:84%
where these relatively cool gas
in the atmosphere of the sun

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.195 align:middle line:90%
absorbs things.

00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:21.320 align:middle line:84%
You would think we would
know what all of them are.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't do we.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: We don't know
what all of them are.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
There are some elements in
the sun that-- or something

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
in the sun, just small amounts
we're pretty sure that we're

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.562 align:middle line:90%
not yet able to identify.

00:06:30.562 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:90%
We can identify most of them.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.270 align:middle line:90%
So we're on the right track.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are probably
some complex molecules

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't think might
be there in that abundance.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know them all.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Science is a frontier.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:84%
We're always expanding
that frontier.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.862 align:middle line:84%
Science is not a
textbook that you read

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:90%
and you know an answer.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's it, we're done.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.170 align:middle line:90%
There's always a frontier.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
We're always going
out and finding more.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even
know helium existed

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.900 align:middle line:90%
till we saw it in the sun.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we found it
here on the Earth.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.490 align:middle line:90%
So there's always a frontier.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This quest, as human
beings that we undertake,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:84%
to explore the moon,
to send rovers to Mars,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:84%
to send other objects out
beyond Pluto, this obsession

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that we have, what
are we looking for?

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.567 align:middle line:84%
What are we really
trying to answer here?

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: Well, I
think we're trying

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.412 align:middle line:90%
to understand a couple things.

00:07:18.412 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to understand
our place in the universe.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to understand
how we came to be,

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:84%
as best we can, with
physics involved.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to
understand dangers to earth.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Like is there
something that's going

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to happen that could
be dangerous to us

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know?

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:90%
So all of do combine, I think.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:84%
In my view, we're in The Golden
Age of space exploration.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:84%
We've got satellites, robotic
satellites, orbiting Mercury.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Japan has one around Venus,
many around the Earth, Mars, now

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter with Saturn
with Cassini.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:84%
We've had New Horizons
go past Pluto.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.599 align:middle line:84%
It is just a golden age of
solar system exploration.

00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And even in the past
few years, we've

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.216 align:middle line:84%
discovered all these
exoplanets, too.

00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So the knowledge of the
universe, of planets,

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:84%
has just exploded in
the past few years.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a golden
age of exploration.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're fortunate
to live through it.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just a few weeks ago
they discovered another planet.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Amazing.

00:08:11.155 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That was
they say, earth like.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: Amazing.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:10%
Well, we don't know
if it's earth like,

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.249 align:middle line:10%
but we know that it's in the
right place around the nearest

00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:18.048 align:middle line:10%
star.

00:08:18.048 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The nearest star is
Proxima Centauri.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:84%
It's in the Alpha
Centauri system.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Proxima Centauri is
too much more red

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.160 align:middle line:90%
and dimmer than the sun.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
But Alpha Centauri I think
it's B, it might be A,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:90%
is similar to the sun.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But Promixa Centauri
has a planet

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.200 align:middle line:84%
that they discovered just a
few weeks ago called Proxima B.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:84%
And it is in the zone where
it can house liquid water.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know all
that much about it.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't know, it might
have to be spinning,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.970 align:middle line:84%
it might have to
have an atmosphere.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.886 align:middle line:84%
It might not be hospitable
beautiful for life.

00:08:44.886 --> 00:08:47.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's like 4 and
1/2 light years away.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:84%
If there is some kind of
intelligent life there,

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, we could
exchange messages with it.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And this was just
discovered this year.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old it it?

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:10%
Do we know?

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:10%
With us being 4 and
1/2 billion years old,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.210 align:middle line:10%
how old would they be?

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.217 align:middle line:90%
About the same?

00:09:02.217 --> 00:09:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: We have
no way of knowing.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
It's again part of
this great frontier.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.097 align:middle line:90%
Probably--

00:09:08.097 --> 00:09:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It should be about the
same, though, don't you think?

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.674 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not that
far away from us.

00:09:12.674 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: Are you
talking about to the life,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.560 align:middle line:90%
whether life developed?

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:84%
See life developed
probably because

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.144 align:middle line:90%
of a bunch of coincidences.

00:09:18.144 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And when those coincidences
occur could be almost any time.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.870 align:middle line:90%
But when did the planet form?

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:84%
The planet formed probably
around the same time.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As we did, right?

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.696 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: As we did.

00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And then way out
into the universe

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
were planetary systems
and star systems

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:90%
that formed much earlier?

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
What's the evolution
of a system?

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:90%
How long does it take?

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
From the moment this
so-called big bang

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
occurred, which we'll
get into, how long

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.919 align:middle line:84%
does it take for a solar
system to literally blossom?

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: Well, first of all,
this is not my research area.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.214 align:middle line:84%
So I teach astronomy, and
so I know some things.

00:09:54.214 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But as Jerry and I would
joke, sometimes we're

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:84%
only about two slides
deep on things.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So I might hit the
edge of my knowledge.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:84%
There are solar systems, though,
being formed like right now.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:84%
There are stars being
formed in nebula.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Star formation is ongoing.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.339 align:middle line:84%
The first burst
of star formation

00:10:08.339 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:84%
occurred well earlier
in the universe

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and probably produced
such massive stars

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:84%
that planets wouldn't do
very well around that.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.650 align:middle line:84%
But then there was a
second generation of stars.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And probably planets
did well around them.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.590 align:middle line:90%
When those planets formed?

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Probably when
those stars formed,

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:84%
which is 5-10 10
billion years ago.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So there have been
quite a lot of time

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:84%
for planets to form around
stars in the universe.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you find as
a physicist, Robert, to be

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.870 align:middle line:84%
the most fascinating
aspect of what you work for

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.649 align:middle line:90%
and what you're looking for?

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: I don't know,
it's a big candy store to me.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:10%
I feel so lucky to be in there.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
I like, geez-- I wasn't
prepared for that question.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I like to think about
the universe as a whole,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and wonder what it
was like in the past,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and what's going to happen in
the future of the universe.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how common
life is in the universe.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.966 align:middle line:90%
That's a big question with me.

00:11:00.966 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like us?

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Yes.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.675 align:middle line:90%
How unique are humans?

00:11:03.675 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I wonder-- yeah, those are
two of the big questions.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about the
beginning how it all started?

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I have a difficult time
comprehending the Big Bang

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for
anyone to explain it to me.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Or on the radio
show, Coast to Coast,

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:84%
I've had many
experts on, Robert,

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and I just can't get
that right answer.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Because to me, I
think of something

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
that begins-- meaning that there
was nothing before that-- so I

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.030 align:middle line:84%
don't understand
how could this be.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Nobody understands.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
We only go back so
far-- physicists

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
can only take us back so
far before we pick it up

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and say OK, starting
at this epoch,

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.981 align:middle line:84%
we can start to pick
up what's going on.

00:11:48.981 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
The temperature must
have been about this.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And these kinds of nuclear
elements must have formed.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.466 align:middle line:84%
And then, these things must
have happened for the universe

00:11:55.466 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:90%
to be like it is today.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But humanity can
only go back so far.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:90%
All knowledge has an edge.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.975 align:middle line:84%
Science isn't as it
is in its textbook,

00:12:02.975 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
where we look up
at the Big Bang.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:84%
We can go back to maybe about
10 to the minus 3 seconds

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
after it seems like
something happened.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
If you just extrapolate back
from things moving away.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:84%
If you move things back to
each other and then say OK,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
once it gets down to
that small and that hot,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what happens.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Could the universe
have come from nothing?

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Don't know, it's a speculation.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what nothing?

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: It's a lot
of fun to speculate.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:10%
But science--

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It will drive you crazy
trying to get those answers.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: It drives us
to try to find the answers.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the drivers.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why there
are so many people

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.231 align:middle line:84%
trying to find the answer,
trying to launch satellites,

00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
trying to analyze cosmic
equations that drove Einstein.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:90%
It drives a lot of people.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:90%
We want to know.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:90%
But we can't know everything.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.536 align:middle line:84%
All we do is we push back the
time that we understand the Big

00:12:46.536 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Bang a little bit earlier
and a little bit earlier.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.326 align:middle line:84%
I, myself, have given
up hope that we're

00:12:50.326 --> 00:12:51.637 align:middle line:90%
going to push it to zero.

00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:84%
We're never going
to go back that far.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
understand a little bit more

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit more
incrementally as we go.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.756 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean can we
explain what nothing is?

00:12:59.756 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:84%
What is nothing in the
scope of the universe?

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: Yeah, so
nothing is a loaded term.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.919 align:middle line:84%
It means something
to do physicists.

00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:07.317 align:middle line:84%
It means something
to other people.

00:13:07.317 --> 00:13:09.150 align:middle line:84%
People used to think
the vacuum was nothing.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:84%
But then people
realized that there

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:84%
were all these quantum states
that are inherent in vacuum.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible that out of
one of these quantum states,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:84%
there could have been a
fluctuation out of which

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:90%
the universe developed.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.310 align:middle line:90%
But no one knows that for sure.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So even analyzing nothing
is a loaded question.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when you look
at like simplest stuff,

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.280 align:middle line:84%
you find the most
interesting stuff.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.899 align:middle line:84%
Like if you were to
look out in space

00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and not look at something--
don't look at a star.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Don't look at a galaxy.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.244 align:middle line:90%
Just look at blank space.

00:13:36.244 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
You think, we'll
that'd be boring,

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
but that's absolutely
fascinating,

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.250 align:middle line:84%
because you see
galaxies way back

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:84%
to when galaxies were near,
when galaxies were just forming.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.615 align:middle line:84%
So staring at empty
space told us a lot.

00:13:46.615 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Thinking about nothing,
you would think, well

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.400 align:middle line:84%
what do you have to
think about nothing?

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing there,
nothing to learn.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.880 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.130 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of things.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:84%
When you eliminate
everything, what's left over

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.560 align:middle line:90%
can be really interesting.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.465 align:middle line:90%
It can be quantum fluctuations.

00:13:57.465 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:84%
It could be particles that are
acting in ways we didn't know.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
They could be formed
Bose-Einstein condensates

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:90%
or things we didn't even know.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.087 align:middle line:84%
So eliminating things
and just looking

00:14:07.087 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
at what's left over,
although it might

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.336 align:middle line:84%
be a definition for
nothing, is actually

00:14:10.336 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:84%
a door to try to
figure out what's

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:90%
going on in the universe.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One of the most
fascinating pictures

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.780 align:middle line:10%
I've ever seen from space,
taken by Hubble, where they just

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:10%
took a glance at the
darkness of space,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:10%
and when you looked
at the picture,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:10%
there were hundreds and
hundreds of galaxies,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.374 align:middle line:10%
not stars, but galaxies
with billions of stars.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: It's called
the Hubble Deep Field.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.206 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:14:37.206 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:10%
It's in your book.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.773 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: And it
was so interesting.

00:14:39.773 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
They went back and they did the
Hubble Ultra Deep Field now.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And they do the
Southern Deep Field

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And then they keep looking--

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's endless.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: You're right.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that's part of the
reason why the James Webb Space

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Telescope will be
launched in another year

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.690 align:middle line:90%
to look even further back.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.565 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that James Webb will do

00:14:54.565 --> 00:14:56.490 align:middle line:84%
is he'll look at
seemingly empty space,

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and see what faint
galaxies are really there.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:84%
What faint stuff
is really there.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.020 align:middle line:90%
It truly is.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And now they talk about
the other universes,

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:90%
the multiverses.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Is that a possibility?

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: OK.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:84%
So multiverses gets
you into something

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that-- the kind of
science that I like

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
is what's called
falsifiable science.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.310 align:middle line:84%
You have some
scientific theory that

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:90%
makes specific predictions.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you try to see if
those predictions are true.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.857 align:middle line:84%
If the theory is a good
theory, it predicts things.

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:29.690 align:middle line:90%
It can be falsified.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:90%
It can be shown to be false.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.375 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's shown
to be true, it

00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:33.830 align:middle line:90%
can also be shown to be false.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.290 align:middle line:84%
If the theory can't be
shown to be true or false,

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
then it might be
really interesting,

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.050 align:middle line:84%
but it's not science
by some definitions.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So the multiverses,
they're very interesting,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:84%
but the people who
think about multiverses

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.500 align:middle line:84%
have yet to make a
prediction that can really

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.490 align:middle line:90%
be tested as true or false.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So currently, it's not
mainstream science.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.850 align:middle line:84%
It's really fun to think
about, but it's really

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.450 align:middle line:84%
not mainstream
science in my opinion.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.158 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's kind
of hard to imagine

00:16:01.158 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
these bubbles of universes
all intertwined and connected.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:90%
To me there's one universe.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:10%
That's big enough
for everything.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: If
people can come up

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.469 align:middle line:10%
with very specific predictions--
and there have been some tries.

00:16:14.469 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
There have been people
thinking that if you

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
look at the microwave
background radiation.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you look in the--
microwave heats your coffee.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
That radiation comes to
us from all directions.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.640 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
details of that.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And you see it's not
completely smooth.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:90%
There are little bumps on that.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:84%
From little bumps
on that, we can

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.680 align:middle line:84%
learn about the very early
universe that put the bumps

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:90%
there gravitationally.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
that if there were

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
some kind of other
universes, they

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:84%
would have left traces on
the microwave background

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:90%
that we could have seen.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So there have been people
looking at the microwave

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
background, and
nothing falsifiable

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:90%
has ever been found.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:10%
It just hasn't been found yet.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:10%
So right now, it's just really
fun speculation, not verified.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think, just
based on odds and statistics,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.710 align:middle line:84%
that there are other planetary
systems with beings like us

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:04.693 align:middle line:90%
all over the place?

00:17:04.693 --> 00:17:06.859 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: It's really fun
to speculate about that.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.817 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that's
somewhat falsifiable,

00:17:08.817 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:84%
because we send out messages
hoping to hear a return.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.680 align:middle line:10%
And now with Proxima B, we can
beam it right at Proxima B.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.055 align:middle line:10%
Although the chances are that
they would hear and say oh,

00:17:17.055 --> 00:17:19.450 align:middle line:10%
look, Earth's calling, let's
call it phone back is probably

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:10%
pretty small.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.569 align:middle line:10%
But we can test
things like that.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:90%
I would say there probably are.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Probably many.

00:17:26.995 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Probably.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah and so you
get into what's is

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.358 align:middle line:90%
called the Tipler Conjecture.

00:17:30.358 --> 00:17:33.400 align:middle line:84%
If they're out there, how come
they haven't come visit us?

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.049 align:middle line:90%
How come we don't see them yet?

00:17:35.049 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe they have.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Maybe they have.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But all the people
who said they have,

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
when you check into
the detailed stories,

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.350 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
falsifiable stories.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
They don't they
don't always pan out.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
They don't come up with
here, this is true,

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:84%
check it in this way and we
check it, oh, yeah you're

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:90%
right that's where.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't work out.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
We would love for
it to work out.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:84%
We would love for
it to work out.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.020 align:middle line:90%
We just don't have the evidence.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:90%
We just don't have it.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of NASA's
most popular websites,

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Robert, is called APOD.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:00.791 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: So I used to work
at NASA's Goddard Space Flight

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.430 align:middle line:10%
Center in Greenbelt, Maryland,
and I had an office mate Jerry

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.530 align:middle line:10%
Bonnell, Dr. Jerry Bonnell.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:13.374 align:middle line:84%
And we were investigating,
we had a group there

00:18:13.374 --> 00:18:15.040 align:middle line:84%
that would investigate
gamma ray bursts.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And we were involved in
something called the Science

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Support Center for gamma rays.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So there was something
called the Compton Gamma Ray

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.519 align:middle line:84%
Observatory-- a
lot of facts here--

00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:24.185 align:middle line:84%
and so when people wanted to use
the data from the Compton Gamma

00:18:24.185 --> 00:18:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Ray Observatory, we might
become involved in advising them

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:90%
on ways to do that.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.624 align:middle line:84%
But we would also do research
into gamma ray bursts

00:18:31.624 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:84%
because these were
these huge explosions

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.748 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't know
where they were.

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:90%
But we were officemates.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.610 align:middle line:90%
And we became friends.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And so about once a year,
the leader of our group,

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:46.200 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] would go off
and create a summer place

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:90%
where he would retire to.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we were sort of left
alone with all these computers,

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.290 align:middle line:84%
like "Home Alone"
with NASA's computers.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.090 align:middle line:90%
So we would have fun.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So one year what
we did is-- so I'm

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:84%
going to do a little
story-- so on year

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
what we did is we got into the
debate about random numbers.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.519 align:middle line:84%
So I looked over
at Jerry and I said

00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I can create the perfect
random number generator.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:90%
He said no way.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.620 align:middle line:90%
There's no way you can do that.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:90%
I said here is what it is.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the difference, it's the
digits of irrational numbers.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:84%
He says they're not
random because you can

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:90%
predict exactly what they are.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.878 align:middle line:84%
I said yeah, but
if you didn't know

00:19:19.878 --> 00:19:23.770 align:middle line:84%
that, you didn't know it was
exactly pi or square root of 2,

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.050 align:middle line:90%
they'd be random.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.239 align:middle line:84%
He'd say well, OK, maybe
but how random are they?

00:19:27.239 --> 00:19:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we got into this
really interesting line

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:90%
of thought that goes like this.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Is there a difference
between perfect knowledge

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.852 align:middle line:90%
and perfect randomness?

00:19:34.852 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:84%
You would think well there's
every difference in the world.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.393 align:middle line:90%
It's completely different.

00:19:38.393 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you went to the
library and you started taking

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
out the first book you saw and
the first letter's a, so you

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:90%
put 01, b 02.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And you encode that entire
book in just numbers 26 for z,

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:54.170 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So then you get this
really long number.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And that number
encodes the book.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.765 align:middle line:84%
So now do the next book
and do the next book,

00:20:00.765 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and the next one, until
you get this really, really

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:90%
long number.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.809 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot of
repetition in that number.

00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Generally, the two digit
numbers don't go past 26.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So the numbers are
aren't used efficiently.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's say oh I'm
going to compact that.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use instead of just
doing zero to 26, one to 26,

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.976 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
a more compact way.

00:20:20.976 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
shorten this a little bit.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And so this stream that
looked very nonrandom,

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:84%
because there was never
anything above 50,

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
now it starts to
look more random.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And as you compact this data
stream, more and more and more,

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:84%
it begins to look
more and more random.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet all the knowledge of the
library is in that data stream.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
thinking, wow, this

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
is kind of fits the "Beyond
Belief" theme of this show.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like sort of real,
but it's beyond belief.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Could all of this
knowledge of the universe

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:84%
be encoded in like
the digits of pi?

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Like it's some kind of
universe encyclopedia?

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:90%
So we said well, let's look.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.436 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to try to
get the digits of pi.

00:21:01.436 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And there were
people at Columbia

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.070 align:middle line:84%
who computed lots
of digits of pi.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And we asked them, send
us your digits of pi.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:90%
And they wouldn't do it.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't even
respond to our email.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: They were looking
for their own non-randomness.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.780 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
us to look for it.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.329 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to
do other things.

00:21:16.329 --> 00:21:18.620 align:middle line:84%
We decided to look for a
square root of 2 with a number

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
that's-- what number
squared gives you two?

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.220 align:middle line:90%
It's the square root of two.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And also there's a
number, Euler's number,

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.030 align:middle line:84%
e. e, it turned out, was
really easy to calculate

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle line:90%
comparatively.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So we generated lots
of digits of that.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we didn't
know it at the time,

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.676 align:middle line:84%
but we set the world record
for computing digits of e

00:21:34.676 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's why you guys are
the physicists and we're not.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:39.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: It was kind of fun.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:84%
We would have like the Olympics
of different algorithms.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.394 align:middle line:90%
And we would test them.

00:21:42.394 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we would
test them to see

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.351 align:middle line:84%
if there's any
repetition, if there's

00:21:45.351 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:90%
anything nonrandom there.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Are the digits of
e really random?

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.830 align:middle line:84%
If they are, then we can
use them in our algorithms.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Because when you do
simulations of the universe,

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.824 align:middle line:84%
you need random numbers to help
you generate random processes.

00:21:57.824 --> 00:21:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But if they're not, then
we've made a big discovery.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:90%
So we thought it was win-win.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
We looked through that and we
couldn't find non-randomness.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So now, with all
that, what did you do,

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.500 align:middle line:84%
put it on this website
that we're talking about?

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.916 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: We
have a website now.

00:22:11.916 --> 00:22:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
the digit warehouse.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to know
like several million digits

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:84%
of square root of
two, five, e, you

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:84%
can just go there
and download it.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.600 align:middle line:90%
It was done in 1994.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.755 align:middle line:84%
And at time, 10 megabytes was
enough to freeze your computer.

00:22:29.755 --> 00:22:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So to a layman,
if you want to download it,

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.534 align:middle line:90%
what do I do with it?

00:22:33.534 --> 00:22:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: You click on it.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes
in and you save it.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So a layman just
looks through it

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.381 align:middle line:90%
and tries to look for patterns.

00:22:40.381 --> 00:22:41.677 align:middle line:90%
Like ooh, is that an alien?

00:22:41.677 --> 00:22:42.631 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:42.631 --> 00:22:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Like you try to
print it out in rows.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And you scroll it buy
and you try to see.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And your eye picks up all kinds
of stuff, but when you test it,

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:84%
we can't find any
significant non-randomness

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.184 align:middle line:84%
to the digits of e or the
square root of numbers.

00:22:56.184 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was fun to
kind of look for that.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.359 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we
did one summer.

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
literally find out

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.960 align:middle line:84%
if there's extraterrestrial
life out there based on numbers?

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: Well, as Carl Sagan
did in the movie "Contact,"

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.800 align:middle line:84%
he had one of his characters
look in the digits of pi.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And then after many random,
seemingly random digits,

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:90%
then it got down to a 0000100.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And it started giving a
grid, which was a circle.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And that was in Carl
Sagan's book "Contact."

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it made the movie.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.988 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we didn't
know that at the time

00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:27.220 align:middle line:90%
we were searching for these.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, there could have been
some universal message encoded

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:90%
in digits or irrational numbers.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could
have been coming

00:23:33.505 --> 00:23:34.850 align:middle line:90%
in from all over the universe.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.266 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: But
we didn't find it.

00:23:36.266 --> 00:23:38.499 align:middle line:84%
If it was there, we
would have told you.

00:23:38.499 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:90%
I would be famous by now.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:10%
I would come and told
you personally, George.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Because people say
that you folks from NASA

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.114 align:middle line:10%
would never tell us anything.

00:23:46.114 --> 00:23:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: NASA's
actually a very open.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.238 align:middle line:84%
That's punching
some of my buttons.

00:23:49.238 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
So in my view, NASA is like one
of the most famous-- so first

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:90%
of all, disclosure.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I get money from NASA to
run the NASA Astronomy

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Picture of the Day, which
is translated into--

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who picks the picture?

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:90%
You do?

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: Jerry Bonnell
and I pick all the pictures.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Which you've got illustrated in
your book, "The Universe 365."

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: Yes so
we have come out

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.398 align:middle line:10%
with two books, that here's
one of the books, "The Universe

00:24:08.398 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:10%
in 365 Days."

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Still great
pictures, by the way.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: So these
are printed out.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:14.890 align:middle line:84%
You see resolution
on the screen,

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:16.340 align:middle line:84%
but if you really
want high resolution,

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.923 align:middle line:84%
if you want to put
it up on your wall,

00:24:17.923 --> 00:24:20.482 align:middle line:90%
then you can buy the book.

00:24:20.482 --> 00:24:22.565 align:middle line:84%
And there's a companion
book, to it, another book.

00:24:22.565 --> 00:24:26.040 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So one year, we did
square root of new digits.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.862 align:middle line:84%
And then the next year, Jay
went out to do his ranch

00:24:31.862 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and we sat around and we said,
well, here we are home alone

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.500 align:middle line:84%
again, and we notice
that at this point

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.960 align:middle line:90%
the internet was really strong.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.784 align:middle line:84%
And the worldwide
web was coming up.

00:24:39.784 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And people were
saying, oh, you've

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.230 align:middle line:90%
got to see this worldwide web.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
don't another program.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Who needs that?

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at it and I slowly
became convinced that wow, this

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.170 align:middle line:90%
is really something.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And so NASA had a high
bandwidth connection to the web

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:90%
back then.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:90%
And so we said, what can we do?

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:58.940 align:middle line:84%
We were fortunate to be
able to sit here and have

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous connection like a
modern connection back in 1996.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So we decided that
we were getting

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.702 align:middle line:84%
all these email
attachments, look

00:25:07.702 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:84%
at this great image,
a lot of people they

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.840 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what the image was.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:90%
It's really colorful.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that is.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Now may times, NASA will
give a press release,

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes the image
was somehow separated

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.250 align:middle line:90%
from the press release.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So we decided one
thing we can do

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.030 align:middle line:84%
is we can try to make the
web into an intelligent web

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.960 align:middle line:84%
where you see something
that is explained as opposed

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.507 align:middle line:84%
to a stupid web
where people just

00:25:28.507 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
see something they
don't say, and they

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.377 align:middle line:90%
say oh wow, that was amazing.

00:25:31.377 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that is.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is our attempt to
make the web a little bit more

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:35.770 align:middle line:90%
intelligent.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.620 align:middle line:10%
So we decided to take pictures
that were being sent around

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.099 align:middle line:10%
and post them, one a day--

00:25:40.099 --> 00:25:42.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh and you get like a
million hits a day, don't you?

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: Yes.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.519 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: Now outside of
the main nasa.gov domain,

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:84%
we are the most
popular site at NASA.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:90%
And we have social media.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So you can find us on Facebook
and Twitter and Google+

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:90%
and Instagram.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And people who translate
us into other languages,

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.340 align:middle line:84%
they do it because
they're really interested.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.100 align:middle line:90%
They just love these pictures.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.320 align:middle line:90%
They love the idea of NASA.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And they love the idea of
exploring the solar system

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and understanding our earth
and our surroundings better.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:90%
And so these people.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.620 align:middle line:90%
They're volunteers.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:90%
They all volunteer.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.837 align:middle line:84%
We don't have enough money
in our budget to pay them.

00:26:18.837 --> 00:26:20.920 align:middle line:84%
But they do it because
they're just so interested.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think NASA
is one of the most popular--

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.620 align:middle line:84%
it's a relatively small
part of the US government.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:31.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a half of a percent of
the budget of the US government

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.510 align:middle line:84%
budget, but it's like
the best known abroad.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:35.800 align:middle line:84%
If you go abroad you
say NASA, it's like wow,

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.357 align:middle line:90%
we can't do what NASA did.

00:26:37.357 --> 00:26:38.690 align:middle line:90%
We can't put people on the moon.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:42.800 align:middle line:84%
We can't fly a
spacecraft past Pluto.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.720 align:middle line:90%
It's just legendary.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.380 align:middle line:84%
The worldwide appeal of NASA is
very strong, and deservedly so,

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.721 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert,
some of the pictures

00:26:50.721 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen of let's say Mars
that sent back by the rovers,

00:26:55.370 --> 00:27:00.920 align:middle line:84%
clearly you can see some objects
there that are very strange.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Whether it looks like
a petrified reptile

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:84%
or a rat or a fossil
or the head of a robot,

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.919 align:middle line:84%
is that just an usual
rock formations?

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:15.210 align:middle line:90%
What the heck are those things?

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: In a word, yes.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:17.050 align:middle line:90%
These are rovers.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.425 align:middle line:84%
So if we saw
something like that,

00:27:18.425 --> 00:27:20.200 align:middle line:84%
we'd send the rover
out and look at it.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
any stream of images--

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.160 align:middle line:84%
so if we were to
take your smartphone

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and we were to go through
and find your family's

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.330 align:middle line:84%
get together or
your birthday party.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:84%
I know you had a big
birthday party, recently,

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.540 align:middle line:90%
happy birthday.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.340 align:middle line:84%
We could find somebody
in the background

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
that looks like an
alien in his underpants.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean there was really
an alien in his underpants

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.320 align:middle line:90%
at your birthday party?

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Turns out it was just
some guy doing something.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Those are much more common to
have these false alarms than

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.860 align:middle line:84%
to actually have an alien show
up at your birthday party.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.942 align:middle line:84%
So if you have lots
of images of Mars,

00:27:50.942 --> 00:27:53.400 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get some things
that look a little strange.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And we've memorized
all these icons

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:84%
in our life of books and
people and things like that.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we naturally
see these icons.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Because way back, if
you could identify,

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.690 align:middle line:84%
if you could see an icon of
a lion, you would survive.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you couldn't see
it, you might not survive.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So our brains are just
tremendously powerful computers

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.824 align:middle line:90%
of picking up icons.

00:28:13.824 --> 00:28:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But those
people, though,

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.310 align:middle line:84%
those experts who look
at those pictures,

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:21.139 align:middle line:84%
do they sometimes go
wow, what is that?

00:28:21.139 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Sure, all the time.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they do?

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:23.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Oh, yeah.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.305 align:middle line:84%
And then they try
to come up with

00:28:25.305 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:84%
a logical, falsifiable
explanation using

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.450 align:middle line:90%
common physics for what it is.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.409 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably just if
you look at enough rocks,

00:28:35.409 --> 00:28:36.950 align:middle line:84%
some rocks are going
to look strange.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.033 align:middle line:84%
If we go out to the parking
lot and look at rocks,

00:28:39.033 --> 00:28:40.090 align:middle line:90%
we could find an odd one.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that it
was an alien put it there?

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Not in my opinion.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
We can find a
conventional explanation.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And only when you run out of
conventional explanations,

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.389 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, should you go to
the conventional explanations.

00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:90%
And we haven't run out of them.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.340 align:middle line:90%
These are rock formations.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sure would be great
to know, though, that there

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:58.440 align:middle line:90%
was something up there, right?

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: It would be great.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.770 align:middle line:90%
It would just be unbelievable.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And so NASA is
spending money to try

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to find planets like
the Earth because it

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:05.940 align:middle line:90%
would be so unbelievable.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.630 align:middle line:84%
NASA's spending money
to try to send out

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:12.370 align:middle line:84%
communications and listen for
communications through SETI.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Haven't found it yet.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:15.236 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we'll find it.

00:29:15.236 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So, it's such a great
question, we're trying.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:84%
But it wouldn't be really
responsible to report

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.207 align:middle line:90%
that we have found it.

00:29:20.207 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:84%
We're not trying to
cover anything up.

>>NOORY: Why do so
many people so sinister

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:84%
about government,
about NASA, thinking

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.150 align:middle line:84%
as if you know
everything already,

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.530 align:middle line:84%
you've got a secret
space program,

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
tell us anything.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Why do they think that?

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: I'm not sure.

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.730 align:middle line:84%
That gets into
psychology of people.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.140 align:middle line:90%
I do know I've worked at NASA.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.940 align:middle line:90%
And it was a fun place.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:84%
People feel very
privileged to work at NASA.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:84%
When you work at NASA you get
paid only not in only in money,

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.810 align:middle line:90%
but in prestige.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.450 align:middle line:84%
We're not people
trying to figure out

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:84%
how to deceive the public,
our morale is really high.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.960 align:middle line:84%
How could our morale
be so high if we

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.110 align:middle line:84%
sit around trying to
deceive people all the time?

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.447 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to figure out
how to explore the universe.

00:30:07.447 --> 00:30:09.780 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to figure out
what's the next logical step?

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.240 align:middle line:84%
What kind of spacecraft could
we need that would help us?

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.460 align:middle line:84%
If there was fossilized
life on Mars,

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.290 align:middle line:90%
what spacecraft might do that?

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:19.490 align:middle line:84%
If there was an intelligent
civilization out there,

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:84%
what spacecraft do
we need to see that?

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:90%
We're trying.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.570 align:middle line:90%

me nuts are people who

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.890 align:middle line:90%
say we never went to the moon.

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:90%
That drives me nuts.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean we've lost astronauts
trying to get to the moon.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:84%
We have had hundreds
of thousands

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.080 align:middle line:84%
of people working
under these programs.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.289 align:middle line:84%
How could they say
we faked all that?

00:30:43.289 --> 00:30:44.580 align:middle line:90%

The privilege of being-- if
someone has a point of view,

00:30:50.889 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:84%
you can then appear on
the stage and appear

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.040 align:middle line:84%
to have an equally
valid point of view

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.710 align:middle line:84%
if you present the
other point of view.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And then it looks like
it's 50/50 between the two.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's that.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually not
prepared to debate that.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.150 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
study that very strongly

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and they are able to rebut
every argument specifically.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I strongly believe
we went to the moon.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of the greatest
things humanity has ever done.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.928 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the greatest
things the United States has

00:31:13.928 --> 00:31:15.730 align:middle line:90%
done, that NASA has done.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.330 align:middle line:84%
We went to this orbiting-- this
body that orbits the earth.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:20.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.120 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.690 align:middle line:90%
And we should be proud of it.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:23.840 align:middle line:90%
And most people are.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.094 align:middle line:90%

the late Edgar Mitchell.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:90%
He was on Apollo 14.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.250 align:middle line:90%
He went to the moon.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I believe the guy when
he told me the stories

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.620 align:middle line:84%
that he went to the moon,
that he actually was

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.580 align:middle line:90%
there, and walked on the moon.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he was
lying to me at all.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think once people get
a better understanding of who

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.540 align:middle line:84%
these individuals
were, what they did

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.010 align:middle line:84%

they did for this country,

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and risking their
lives to do it,

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.107 align:middle line:84%
I think they'd get a better
perspective for that.

Tell me about that trail.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.610 align:middle line:90%
What was happening?

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: Well this
was a Chinese rocket

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.370 align:middle line:84%
booster that was falling back
to Earth a few months ago.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And so people just
happened to be outside.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.280 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is that we're
monitoring the night sky more

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.570 align:middle line:90%
than we ever have before.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And that night was soon
after Pokemon Go came out

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:54.170 align:middle line:84%
so people were out with
their smartphones in Utah.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And they just happened
to have their smartphones

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.940 align:middle line:84%
outside chasing Pokemon
monsters, I guess.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's so easy just
to move and look and see

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:02.230 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So we actually have
some really good video

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:06.382 align:middle line:90%
of this rocket breaking up.

00:33:06.382 --> 00:33:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And you could tell it's
not a meteor, generally

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.890 align:middle line:84%
because the rocket parts
are moving so slow,

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:15.559 align:middle line:84%
and because they've spanned
out and make up a larger cloud.

00:33:15.559 --> 00:33:17.600 align:middle line:84%
But this is what happens
sometimes if you're just

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.660 align:middle line:90%
out with your smartphone.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.220 align:middle line:84%
You can catch some
amazing things.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.440 align:middle line:84%

that we have on APOD

are just by people in the right
place at the right time that

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and be sure you're going
to get something good.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, it's the
person with the smartphone

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.160 align:middle line:84%
in the right place at the right
time that gets the best images.

So what are we looking
at here, Robert?

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: OK.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is THE New
Horizons spacecraft

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:90%
is approaching Pluto.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.534 align:middle line:84%
And now we're seeing Pluto in
detail for the first time ever.

00:33:58.534 --> 00:33:59.700 align:middle line:90%
And so this is a time lapse.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.900 align:middle line:90%
So now it's going around.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're seeing
the Pluto and the sun

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:06.150 align:middle line:90%
as it goes off in the distance.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.899 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are
actually lines drawn

00:34:07.899 --> 00:34:09.230 align:middle line:90%
on where the moons are there.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:13.710 align:middle line:10%
So Pluto before last year
was just this fuzzy blob

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:14.510 align:middle line:10%
in the sky.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:15.344 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:34:15.344 --> 00:34:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: First
it was a planet.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.989 align:middle line:84%
Then it was a dwarf
planet, by official name.

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now that it's
a planetoid, right?

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:90%
It should be a planet.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:22.834 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:34:22.834 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: But it
is a fascinating body

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.791 align:middle line:90%
regardless of what you call it.

00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know
almost anything about it

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:29.480 align:middle line:90%
before last year.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So again, the
frontier has moved.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And what we understand about
the solar system has moved.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:34.939 align:middle line:90%
The goalposts have moved.

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And we now are trying
to figure out--

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.139 align:middle line:90%
Pluto was a lot of surprises.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Its surface was really strange.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.860 align:middle line:90%
It had these smooth regions.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.239 align:middle line:90%
It had these bumpy regions.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.520 align:middle line:84%
It had a clear boundary
between the two.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.730 align:middle line:84%
It had relatively
few impact craters--

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
frozen water there?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: Well, there
might be a little bit

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:52.699 align:middle line:90%
misting on the mountains.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:54.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an expert on Pluto.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But we think that there is
some frozen water there.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.304 align:middle line:84%
But there's also other frozen
nitrogen, for instance.

00:35:00.304 --> 00:35:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Things that you don't
generally find in liquid

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.900 align:middle line:90%
form here on Earth.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.215 align:middle line:84%
But it's so cold on Pluto,
you can find it there.

00:35:06.215 --> 00:35:07.840 align:middle line:84%
We think there might
even be, we think,

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:84%
these bubbles that
are bubbling up,

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.171 align:middle line:84%
not of water, of
relatively frozen liquid.

00:35:12.171 --> 00:35:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It might be nitrogen-- I
might be getting that wrong--

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and we had no guess
that this was happening

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.790 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of Pluto.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it helps us to understand
what happens on our own planet

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.530 align:middle line:84%
by seeing planetary dynamics
on something else like Pluto.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:26.757 align:middle line:90%
And it's just fascinating.

00:35:26.757 --> 00:35:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well and
planetary scientists

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.964 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
think that there could

00:35:29.964 --> 00:35:32.260 align:middle line:90%
be another object beyond Pluto.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.980 align:middle line:84%
That they're finding
more and more things?

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: So there's
speculation about Planet Nine,

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.200 align:middle line:90%
sometimes it's called.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.785 align:middle line:90%
Right now, it's speculation.

00:35:40.785 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We call it Planet X.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NEMIROFF: Or there
certain areas of the sky,

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.155 align:middle line:10%
so one thing is there's these
missions-- not missions,

00:35:48.155 --> 00:35:49.780 align:middle line:10%
they're not space
missions necessarily,

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.196 align:middle line:10%
they're ground
based missions that

00:35:51.196 --> 00:35:53.850 align:middle line:10%
are looking in parts
of the sky for rocks

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.030 align:middle line:10%
or distant objects that move.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So we've found a
lot of objects that

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.820 align:middle line:84%
are about Pluto sized
that are further

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:90%
out in the solar system.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.409 align:middle line:84%
And we think there
might even be one

00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that's larger than that
that's a little bit further

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.720 align:middle line:90%
out than Pluto.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:90%
But we haven't seen it yet.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And right now, it's on the
fuzzy edge of speculation.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But it is sort of
falsifiable science,

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.180 align:middle line:84%
because people are
predicting roughly

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.975 align:middle line:84%
where to look and roughly
how massive it would be.

00:36:16.975 --> 00:36:18.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we
haven't found it yet,

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:19.713 align:middle line:90%
so it's still speculation.

00:36:19.713 --> 00:36:21.552 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
we will find it.

00:36:21.552 --> 00:36:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Let's hope.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I think is a lot of stuff
out there, a lot of Pluto

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.930 align:middle line:84%
sized objects out there
that we haven't found yet

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and in the next few
decades, we will.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there's
one question you

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:84%
would like answered about
the universe, just one,

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:90%
what would it be?

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.238 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: Oh boy, um.

00:36:41.238 --> 00:36:45.400 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, boy.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a toughie.

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NEMIROFF: That's a
real tough question.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I just have so many and I chase
a lot of these in my research.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.800 align:middle line:90%
One question, what would it be?

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.260 align:middle line:90%


00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.240 align:middle line:90%
How does the universe work?

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Are there more fundamental laws
that are operating in some way

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:11.550 align:middle line:84%
that we don't yet know that
can be a lot of use to us?

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.670 align:middle line:84%
That would be-- and if so,
what are those simple laws?

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.650 align:middle line:90%
How can we use them?

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:17.870 align:middle line:84%
How can we use that
to help us better

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:19.410 align:middle line:84%
understand the
universe around us,

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.700 align:middle line:84%
better find energy
sources that we can use?

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So one specific version of
that is what is dark energy?

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So we pay astronomers
and astrophysicists

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.870 align:middle line:90%
to tell us about the universe.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, we don't know
what much of the universe is.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We only know of the 5% that is
made of matter like you and me.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.870 align:middle line:84%
There is something
called dark matter that

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of matter that
gravitates like you and me,

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.240 align:middle line:90%
but it's not like you and me.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.650 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't glow like you and me.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:44.450 align:middle line:90%
But it's out there.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And then there's like 75%
just discovered-- again

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.047 align:middle line:90%
the frontier is moving.

00:37:49.047 --> 00:37:50.380 align:middle line:90%
The research frontier is moving.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.740 align:middle line:84%
We're learning so much
about the universe.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Much of the universe is
about 70% or so of something

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.600 align:middle line:90%
called dark energy.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
dark energy is.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.820 align:middle line:90%
It's like 1,000 years ago.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.070 align:middle line:84%
They knew there was air,
because they could feel wind.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.490 align:middle line:84%
They could see leaves
flutter around.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't think air was
all that important, maybe.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But now, we know
a lot about air.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.800 align:middle line:84%
We know that air is made of
oxygen that keeps us alive,

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.570 align:middle line:84%
nitrogen which
helps plants grow,

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.120 align:middle line:90%
planes can fly through the air.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.880 align:middle line:84%
It's tremendously important
to know about air.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Yet try and explain that
to someone 1,000 years ago.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.330 align:middle line:90%
It's like no, I'm not sure.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know there's
dark energy out there.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.900 align:middle line:90%
We know almost nothing about it.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We will one day.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.637 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, we may answer
some of these questions

00:38:30.637 --> 00:38:31.720 align:middle line:90%
that we're trying to find.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NEMIROFF: It could be it.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:10%
It could be just an oddity that
never turns out to be useful.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.410 align:middle line:10%
It could turn out to
be tremendously useful.

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:39.910 align:middle line:10%
And those who know about it
are tremendously advantaged.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:41.310 align:middle line:10%
It's open research.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:42.360 align:middle line:10%
We know it's there.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:84%
There is verifiable
evidence that we

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.070 align:middle line:84%
see in certain different ways
of astrophysical observations

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:47.870 align:middle line:90%
that it's there.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:48.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what it is.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.240 align:middle line:84%

I know my question would be if
I got that one question would be

00:38:56.870 --> 00:39:00.610 align:middle line:10%
how could something be
created from nothing?

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:01.950 align:middle line:10%
Give me that answer.
