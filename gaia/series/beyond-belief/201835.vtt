>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:84%
We've got a great
program for you tonight.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:10%
Thomas Hatsis with us,
a psychedelic historian,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:10%
a public speaker, an author
of four books, a former--

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:10%
believe it or not--

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:10%
roller derby gold medalist
and, along with partner

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:10%
Eden Woodruff, runs the
Psanctum Psychedelia,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:10%

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:10%
group in Portland, Oregon.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:90%
Tom, welcome to the program.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.202 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS HATSIS: Thanks
for having me, Mr. Noory.

00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about your background.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:90%
How did you get into this?

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Into
psychedelic research?

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.902 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, it started
off by being really terrible

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:90%
at math.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to study
history instead.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: And--

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smart move.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yes.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] I was smart
enough to know better.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:10%
And so I just--

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:10%
I started-- I had an interest
in various indigenous

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:10%
tribes and their cultures
during my teen years.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.890 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I first stumbled
across things like peyote

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:10%
and magic mushrooms.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And I just really
had this desire

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to study the spiritual aspect of
what these plant medicines were

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.862 align:middle line:90%
doing for people.

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is ayahuasca
put in that category too?

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.316 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh absolutely,

00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, although I
hadn't heard of ayahuasca

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.170 align:middle line:90%
yet as a kid.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, ayahuasca is
definitely a fantastic plant

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these indigenous
Native Americans, I assume,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:84%
were all over the
country, weren't they,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:90%
not just one geographic area?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Oh sure, yes, mostly
in today, we would call Mexico.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
They were pretty much
spread all throughout Mexico

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:90%
and in South America.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.810 align:middle line:84%
That's where you get a lot
of the ayahuasca shamanism.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.085 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a word called
entheogen. What does that mean?

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Entheogen is
coined by Carl Ruck,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and it means to generate
divinity from within.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.250 align:middle line:84%
It's based off of an
ancient Greek word

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:84%
enthusiasmos, which means
to have a religious ecstasy.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Whereas that religious
ecstasy with enthusiasmos

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
can include a plant
medicine or not,

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.495 align:middle line:84%
the word entheogen specifically
includes a plant medicine.

00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these
plant medicines

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
give people a false
sense of something else,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:84%
something hallucinogenic that
may be happening or may not be?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It is my
belief that they do not,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:84%
especially if taken
in a sacred context.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:84%
The way I see it is if you
give ayahuasca to 100 people,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and all 100 of those
people come back

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.380 align:middle line:84%
saying that they just
spoke to the mother--

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:84%
with the mother of the universe,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that is scientific
proof right there,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
because you've-- it's
experiential proof.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
100 times and everyone
is coming back

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.958 align:middle line:84%
saying that they've had
this similar experience?

00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
a hallucination.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
piercing the veil.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
dimensions out there,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that these
plant medicines are here

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:90%
to help us pierce that veil.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My first
wording of psychedelics

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
came when the Beatles
went from what

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
they were to the
more psychedelic end

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:90%
of their careers.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:84%
That's when I started
realizing, what is this?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.240 align:middle line:90%
This is strange.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:84%
They were dealing with all
these gurus, plants, and things

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:90%
And they got into that.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
How safe is it for people,
Tom, who don't understand it?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I can't go out and pick
a mushroom and eat it.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.932 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably choke
or poison myself.

00:03:36.932 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It's not
very safe at all

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.598 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know what you're
doing one of the things

00:03:40.598 --> 00:03:42.320 align:middle line:84%
that my group sanctum
psychedelia does

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%
is educate people, especially
with things like mushrooms,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:90%
what mushrooms.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Because people are
going to go pick them,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:84%
and we want to make
sure that people

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:84%
stay safe by at
least giving them

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:84%
some kind of identification
of what to be looking for.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
But we say that with the caveat
to-- don't go out and pick

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
your own mushrooms, and to
definitely learn everything

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:84%
you can about something before
you put it in your body.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes one mushroom
poisonous and another one not?

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well,
the one that is not

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:84%
poisonous will have
psilocybin in it.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.433 align:middle line:90%
At least a psychedelic one will.

00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing like,
what's the difference when

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:84%
a poisonous mushroom
and a gourmet mushroom?

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, the poisonous
mushroom's going to kill you,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and the gourmet one tastes
great on a hamburger.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.228 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet they
look the same--

00:04:28.228 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yes, well there are--

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To most people.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: There are
subtle differences.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, to the untrained eye,
they do look very much the same.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:90%
But to people like--

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I go mushroom picking
every fall with my partner.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:90%
We can identify the safe ones.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And we don't just
get the fun ones.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.348 align:middle line:84%
We get gourmet ones as
well, medicinal ones.

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
know, when you're out

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
looking at mushrooms, you know
what's good and what's bad.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yes, by and large.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't--

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
training, trial and error?

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Oh no,
I'm very fortunate.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I have a really good friend
who is a master forager who

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:84%
has been foraging
not just mushrooms,

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.232 align:middle line:84%
but all kinds of
berries, wild shrubs,

00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:84%
things like that
you could just eat

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:84%
who's just an
absolute encyclopedia

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.617 align:middle line:90%
of the natural world.

00:05:10.617 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you would
trust that person's opinion

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:90%
on the spot?

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Oh,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they said,
grab this mushroom

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and take a bite out
of it, you would.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well,
nobody would ever

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.022 align:middle line:90%
say to eat a fresh mushroom.

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:90%
You'd have to dry them.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.710 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, with that, yeah.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I would definitely
trust them and eat it.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some of them,
the gourmet mushrooms,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.685 align:middle line:84%
are pretty darn
expensive, aren't they?

00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:32.485 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh yeah.

00:05:32.485 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How come?

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.848 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Because
people like them.

00:05:34.848 --> 00:05:35.730 align:middle line:90%
They taste so good.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It's simple-- it's
markets, really.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
If enough people
want morels, they're

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.300 align:middle line:90%
going to jack up the price.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely And
the cheaper mushrooms

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.730 align:middle line:84%
are the snow caps
and things like that?

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure, yeah, yeah.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Even portobellos, I think,
are on the cheaper side,

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:84%
although in grocery
stores, they're

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.617 align:middle line:84%
marked up more than they
should be, in my opinion.

00:05:55.617 --> 00:05:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, this entheogenic experience
that you just talked about,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Tom, goes way back
into human history.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:90%
How far back?

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Wow.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:84%
We could go all the way to
the Paleolithic Age with this

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:84%
if we believe Terence McKenna's,
what he called the stoned ape

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:84%
theory, where he believes that
different primates were just

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:84%
foraging around, and some
stumbled upon mushrooms

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and ate them, and this started
to help their minds grow.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, I personally don't actually
buy the Stone Ape Theory.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
better explanations

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.995 align:middle line:90%
for human evolution--

00:06:25.995 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.937 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: --than
eating mushrooms.

00:06:27.937 --> 00:06:29.760 align:middle line:84%
But if we take the
stoned ape theory

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and bring it up a few hundred
years into the future,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:84%
into the Mesolithic
Period, that's

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:84%
when we start to see
examples of entheogenic art,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
carvings, cave drawings
as well, tapestries.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:84%
We have an image found in
a Xiongnu woman's grave

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
that's this tapestry that shows
this worship of a mushroom.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's pretty significant,
because most tapestries don't

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:90%
survive the ruins of time.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And here we have this
one that did that clearly

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.628 align:middle line:90%
shows these people.

00:06:58.628 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what they
were doing with it,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.212 align:middle line:84%
but they're certainly
holding this mushroom

00:07:02.212 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:90%
in this reverential pose.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
lots of descriptions

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.840 align:middle line:84%
of mushrooms in ancient
paintings and things like that.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the place.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I had heard years
ago that the image

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:84%
of Santa Claus in his big
red outfit was a mushroom.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.540 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Believe it or
not, it's not possible.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I do in my research

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.633 align:middle line:84%
is actually go back
and check, not just--

00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:29.216 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had you
heard that story too?

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I used to
believe that story.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.477 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Absolutely,
and it was my turn

00:07:32.477 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
to ruin Christmas dinner
for my conservative uncle

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:84%
by saying Santa
Claus was a mushroom.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But no, I-- the
indiscretion of youth.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.130 align:middle line:90%
I was wrong about that.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Santa's outfit-- you mentioned
the red and white of his

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:90%
outfit--

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
it actually went through
a variety of changes

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
before, really, Coca-Cola
settled on the red and white.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
It was more marketing
for Coca-Cola

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:84%
than anything to
do with a mushroom.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now,
that's a good point.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.428 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: And
actually, in my book,

00:07:58.428 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:84%
"Psychedelic
Mystery Traditions,"

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.595 align:middle line:84%
I deconstruct the entire Santa
Claus mushroom mythology.

00:08:04.595 --> 00:08:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've
got four pictures.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a
look at each one

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.843 align:middle line:84%
as you tell us a
little bit about what

00:08:08.843 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at here.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So this
is the tapestry

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:90%
from the Xiongnu woman's grave.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
these two figures.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.800 align:middle line:84%
This gentleman
here is holding up

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:90%
this mushroom to this person.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.185 align:middle line:84%
Either this guy's checking
it out-- we really

00:08:24.185 --> 00:08:25.435 align:middle line:90%
don't know what they're doing.

00:08:25.435 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's clearly a
mushroom in his hands.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge mushroom.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.307 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's a huge--

00:08:29.307 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Perhaps even
the Amanita muscaria,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.197 align:middle line:90%
just because of its size.

00:08:33.197 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.081 align:middle line:90%
And that's edible?

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah,
that's very edible.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:84%
It's also, if you're a Smurf,
you can make a house out of it.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:84%
What our next--
now, what is this?

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So this
is the poppy goddess

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.710 align:middle line:90%
from the ancient Mediterranean.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:90%
She's found all over the place.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:84%
She went by many
different names.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.880 align:middle line:84%
In Greece, she was
known as Demeter.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.270 align:middle line:90%
In Egypt, she was called Isis.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.610 align:middle line:90%
In Sumer, she was called Inanna.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.130 align:middle line:84%
In Thrace or Anatolia
or modern day Turkey,

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:90%
she was known as Ceres.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.310 align:middle line:84%
We actually get the
word cereal from Ceres.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.350 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, this was a--

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:90%
this is pretty common.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:84%
People were using things like
opium for medical reasons,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.780 align:middle line:84%
not so much for their euphoric
and painkilling effects,

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.682 align:middle line:84%
although those were absolutely
recognized and enjoyed.

00:09:18.682 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a painkiller.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, as a painkiller.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
But what they were
actually using them for

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:84%
was as a vector to send
you beyond the veil

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.330 align:middle line:84%
to meet with Isis, or whatever
the local name of this goddess

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
was, so that she would
heal you while you

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.672 align:middle line:90%
were in that psychic space.

00:09:34.672 --> 00:09:36.922 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Here's one that's
a little similar to the one

00:09:36.922 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:90%
we just saw.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, it's the same.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.877 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there's a few of them.

00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:84%
They're found all
over the place.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This looks more
like a male here, right?

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe not?

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.822 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: No, there's--
it does look--

00:09:45.822 --> 00:09:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looks like a--

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It has
kind of a male face.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looks like a male face.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: But it does, but
it does also have breasts.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.948 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are their
hands up like that?

00:09:52.948 --> 00:09:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Could be reverential.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:90%
We're not sure.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:90%
It could just be--

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
sometimes today we see people
go like this when somebody

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:90%
says something really--

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I give up.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.347 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: [LAUGHS] Oh, yeah.

00:10:03.347 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
are we looking here?

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.638 align:middle line:84%
We're having serpents
all over the place.

00:10:06.638 --> 00:10:07.438 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:10:07.438 --> 00:10:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a great one.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is strange.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So this is Persephone
rising from the underworld.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole lot of
ancient entheogenic symbolism

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:90%
in this bas-relief.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:90%
You'd mentioned the serpents.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.662 align:middle line:84%
These serpents represent
the underworld, what--

00:10:22.662 --> 00:10:23.662 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The underworld.

00:10:23.662 --> 00:10:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: What we today
would call the other world,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:84%
the Greeks called
the underworld.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hell?

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, hell, that's
Tartarus in ancient Greece.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:90%
So there was three levels.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.650 align:middle line:90%
Tartarus would be like our hell.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:84%
The Elysian Fields would
be like our heaven.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Asphodel Meadows
would be like our purgatory.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So the serpents will take you
to any one of those levels,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
of course, based on
how you behave in life.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, the opium there, that's the
vector that actually takes you

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:90%
into the underworld.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And the grain represents your
rebirth, you coming back anew.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's what this
symbology here is showing.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with
the Rites of Eleusis.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.867 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is the individual?

00:11:03.867 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: This is Persephone
rising from the dead.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
She is the daughter of
the grain goddess Demeter.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Also would be called the
opium goddess in Greece.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They worshipped
all these, didn't they?

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh yeah.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big time.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, so do I.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There must have
been something to this.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh yeah.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, of course,
because that goes

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:84%
back to that question
you had asked about,

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:90%
are these hallucinations?

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Or are people really
encountering these beings?

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:84%
I think, as did
the ancient Greeks,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that they were really
encountering these beings.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
these gods that they

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:84%
talk about, Tom, might
have been extraterrestrial?

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: In some cases,
they could have been.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a friend of mine is
very fond of eating mushrooms

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to actually open up portals
to see UFOs and communicate

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
work for that person?

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: He says it does.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And actually, my
partner, Eden, who

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.885 align:middle line:84%
you'd mentioned
at the beginning,

00:11:53.885 --> 00:11:55.630 align:middle line:90%
she's actually done it with him.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And she was pretty taken
aback by what happened.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:84%
She was like, all
the sudden, they're

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:90%
just flying around in the sky.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're both seeing them,
so it's not a hallucination.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
Gnosticism a little bit.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And how does that tie into
the entheogenic aspect?

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So Gnosticism is a broad term
covering many different belief

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:90%
systems in the ancient world.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, think of
it today, Taco Bell fast--

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.612 align:middle line:84%
Taco Bell, McDonald's,
and Wendy's are

00:12:23.612 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:90%
all "fast food," right?

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.005 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: But they're
all very different.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're
all different.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Gnosticism is the same way.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Gnostics were more or
less mystical Christians.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So some of them had completely
eschewed all earthly delights--

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:90%
wine, sex, whatever.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Other Gnostics did not.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:84%
They said, no, we
are the divinity,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.880 align:middle line:90%
so we should indulge in that.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we have some
pretty good evidence

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:84%
from mostly their enemies,
the church fathers,

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.800 align:middle line:84%
writing about these Gnostic,
saying how, oh, they

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:84%
think they're having
these experiences,

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
but they're really drinking
those magic potions

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:90%
that make them see things.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:90%
So famously, Simon Magus--

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.720 align:middle line:84%
who might not have actually
existed as a person,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.595 align:middle line:84%
but I think that there
was an archetype there

00:13:08.595 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:90%
that it was based off--

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
Epiphanius who wrote

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:84%
saying that Simon Magus was
using these potions to dazzle

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:84%
his initiates so
that they would think

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
he had these powers over
nature, and then they

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:84%
would become part
of his congregation.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it worked
for him, didn't it?

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.725 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: It did work for them.

00:13:23.725 --> 00:13:24.767 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about Jesus?

00:13:24.767 --> 00:13:27.673 align:middle line:90%
Did Jesus practice any of this?

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Jesus is a
tough nut to crack,

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing direct
that would indicate that Jesus

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.390 align:middle line:84%
knew of or used any
kind of plant medicine

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.500 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
However, there is fantastic
ancillary evidence that

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:90%
might point in that direction.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So as just one example,
Jesus was a rabbi.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:84%
He's referred to as a rabbi over
40 times in the New Testament.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So in
order to be a rabbi,

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.090 align:middle line:84%
he would have to be familiar
with the Old Testament.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the Old Testament
there is a holy anointing oil,

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.178 align:middle line:84%
which I'm sure some
of your viewers

00:13:59.178 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:84%
have heard of the
holy anointing oil.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:84%
What they might not know
is that that holy anointing

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.462 align:middle line:84%
oil featured this plant called
kaneh-bosm, which is cannabis.

00:14:07.462 --> 00:14:08.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cannabis, that's right.

00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So Jesus
very well could

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:84%
have been using cannabis
ointments to heal people.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.677 align:middle line:84%
He also might have been
using mandrake ointments.

00:14:15.677 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like CBD, almost.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yes,
exactly, just like CBD.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.770 align:middle line:90%
And there was also mandrake.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was well known
for casting out

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.490 align:middle line:90%
demons in the ancient world.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, how did people in the
ancient world cast out demons?

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, most of the
time, they used

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:84%
this plant called mandrake,
which is highly psychoactive

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:90%
and can be used as an entheogen.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:84%
The historian Josephus, who
was born only a few years

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
after Jesus was
executed, references

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:84%
mandrake as the key way of
casting out demons from people.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of
Jesus's specialties,

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:90%
was casting out demons.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And he does, in
the Gospel of Luke,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:84%
instruct his disciples to go
out and use these ointments

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:84%
on the populace to
those who are sick.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So they could have been
innocuous ointments.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.172 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it's
not unlikely in those days

00:15:03.172 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:84%
that it would have
involved an entheogen.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.047 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think his
followers were higher than

00:15:07.047 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:84%
a kite and kind of assumed
he was doing these incredible

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.820 align:middle line:90%
things, and maybe he wasn't?

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
his direct followers,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:84%
but later Christians
absolutely were.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And we know this from the letter
to the Corinthians from Paul.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
He writes to them saying
that some of the richer

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Corinthians in the
Christian church

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.230 align:middle line:84%
are not waiting for
the lower classes

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:84%
to get out of work before
going to the celebration.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.212 align:middle line:84%
So they were drinking
all the Eucharist

00:15:38.212 --> 00:15:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and eating all the
wafers and everything.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And Paul says, you
can't be doing that.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Some of you are becoming weak,
ill, or dying from doing that.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Wait, what?

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Weak, ill, or dying?

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:84%
What the heck was in
that Eucharist that's

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:90%
causing this kind of reaction?

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, opium will
certainly do that.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Cannabis won't do it.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Mandrake will do it.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Mushrooms won't do it.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:84%
But what was in there
that would cause this?

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.267 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't talking about
regular wine, like you and I,

00:16:02.267 --> 00:16:03.350 align:middle line:90%
we have a great interview.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We go get a bottle
of wine and split it.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.078 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't talking about that.

00:16:06.078 --> 00:16:07.970 align:middle line:84%
He was talking about
a reverential wine

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:84%
that was usually mixed
with these different kinds

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:90%
of additives.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Especially for the
Corinthians, there

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:84%
was an area in their
town known as Mecone,

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.020 align:middle line:90%
which means opium village.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where so
much of the opium--

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: --from
Greece came from.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:90%
So it was most likely opium--

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
know these things, Tom?

00:16:24.305 --> 00:16:26.747 align:middle line:84%
How did they know what to
use and what not to use?

00:16:26.747 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Trial and error.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
times, this stuff

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.550 align:middle line:90%
was all tested on prisoners.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.147 align:middle line:90%
That's really--

00:16:33.147 --> 00:16:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of the era?

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Prisoners, slaves, they just--

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if they
died, they died, right?

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.147 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: If they
died, they died.

00:16:39.147 --> 00:16:41.142 align:middle line:84%
And if they came back
saying, we are all one,

00:16:41.142 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:84%
they're like, oh, let's
see what this one does.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This
psychedelic doesn't work.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Throw it out.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.555 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:16:46.555 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Dr. John Rush appeared
on a Gaia program

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:84%
with Regina Meredith about
historical paintings, which

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:90%
are very fascinating.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:54.730 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.355 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
So let's go back now

00:16:56.355 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:10%
into the mushrooms
in Christian art.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:10%
And I saw your lecture.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:10%
I attended one of your college
lectures about two months ago.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.560 align:middle line:10%
And I was very
curious about this.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.680 align:middle line:10%
But I had to say,
it was really kind

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:10%
of jaw dropping to
see something in some

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.480 align:middle line:10%
of those plates so obvious.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.667 align:middle line:10%
And yet at the
same time, it's not

00:17:16.667 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:10%
anything I would
have questioned had I

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:10%
seen it before understanding
this particular topic.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.470 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't question
why mushrooms pop up

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:29.230 align:middle line:10%
around the base of Jesus's
or Moses or whomever's robes.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:34.630 align:middle line:10%
And in church art in general,
even in stained glass,

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:10%
having mushrooms pop up in
a scene, we don't even--

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.655 align:middle line:10%
I've never questioned
why mushrooms are there.

00:17:40.655 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN RUSH: Well,
you don't expect it.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.155 align:middle line:10%
When you go into these
basilicas, cathedral--

00:17:44.155 --> 00:17:45.743 align:middle line:10%
St. Mark's Basilica,
it's so busy

00:17:45.743 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:10%
that you wouldn't
know what to look for.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, when you go into
St. Mark's, you're like cattle.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.923 align:middle line:90%
They kind of troop you through--

00:17:51.923 --> 00:17:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSH: --and get out and
bring in the next group.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't really
have an awful lot of time

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:90%
to look at it.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, I took pictures.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So when I got back to California
after doing research here,

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.350 align:middle line:84%
there, and everywhere, I
started looking at these images

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and blowing them up and
taking a close look.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But the starting point for all
of this, the starting point

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.330 align:middle line:84%
really is John Allegro
in his book, "The Sacred

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Mushroom and the Cross,"
which came out in 1970.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I was a graduate
student at the time.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't exactly know
what to think about it,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.470 align:middle line:84%
but I kept my eyes
open for these things.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:84%
He had one picture
in the book, which

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.763 align:middle line:84%
could be easily
discredited in the sense

00:18:30.763 --> 00:18:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that they could say, oh, it's
pagan art that just happened

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.388 align:middle line:84%
to be left there because no
one wanted to destroy it,

00:18:35.388 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it was.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:10%
But when I walked into
St. Mark's Basilica,

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:10%
and I saw Jesus
with the mushroom

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.775 align:middle line:10%
in his hand surrounded
by mushrooms, my god.

00:18:47.775 --> 00:18:48.575 align:middle line:10%
I had to--

00:18:48.575 --> 00:18:49.908 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You can't ignore that.

00:18:49.908 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:10%
>>RUSH: I couldn't ignore it.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:10%
And so beginning
in 2001, up until--

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:10%
well, I guess the book
went into publication--

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:10%
the first one, the
"Failed God" book

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:10%
went into publication in 2008.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:10%
I've collected
thousands of images.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:10%
And not only that,
I have friends

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.040 align:middle line:10%
who have hundreds and
hundreds of images.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.140 align:middle line:10%
And we're not--
they're not duplicates.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.415 align:middle line:10%
So they're probably,
in all, at least--

00:19:15.415 --> 00:19:17.040 align:middle line:10%
with some of my
friends, we've probably

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.965 align:middle line:10%
got 4,000 images of this.

00:19:18.965 --> 00:19:20.090 align:middle line:10%
These need to be explained.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:10%
Now, my explanation
may not be correct.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.260 align:middle line:10%
But we need to explain
why the mushroom is there,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:10%
because it's been ignored
by the art historians

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.050 align:middle line:10%
for one reason or another,
either political correctness

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.600 align:middle line:10%
or fear of losing their
academic standing.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.420 align:middle line:90%
I can't say.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, I'm the worst
enemy of the holy mushroom

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:90%
conspiracy theory.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.872 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are.

00:19:41.872 --> 00:19:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I don't buy
any of what he just said.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I was actually literally
debunking everything

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.550 align:middle line:90%
as he was saying in my head.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that his
interpretation, or what got him

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:51.870 align:middle line:90%
to that point, do you think?

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: What got
him to that point

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.910 align:middle line:84%
is an inability to read
medieval languages like Latin,

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Old German, Old
Spanish, Old Italian.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:90%
So I went back.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Those images that
he's talking about,

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.293 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you what every
single one of them is.

00:20:05.293 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And none of them are
actually mushrooms.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:84%
They're really oddly
designed trees,

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.750 align:middle line:84%
but you could actually trace the
pedigree from the ancient world

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:90%
up until medieval times.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Most medieval copyists
weren't working from nature.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.520 align:middle line:84%
They just worked off
of earlier books.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So you could actually trace
how these so-called "mushroom

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:84%
trees," as they call them, took
on the shape that they did.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest problems
that John Rush and anybody

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
that supports this idea has
is that there's literally

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:90%
no record of this anywhere.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.435 align:middle line:90%
So they have a big problem here.

00:20:40.435 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to-- if he's
going to say there are 4,000

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:84%
images, but not
one written text,

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.322 align:middle line:84%
that is a complete
disconnection for how history--

00:20:49.322 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It should
balance, shouldn't it?

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: There should
be a balance there,

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.180 align:middle line:90%
and there's no balance at all.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know a single
New Testament historian

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.542 align:middle line:90%
that takes this seriously.

00:20:58.542 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know a
single art historian

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:90%
that takes this seriously.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a small cadre of kind
of conspiracy theorists

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.782 align:middle line:84%
that take it seriously,
but nobody else does.

00:21:06.782 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you
think he was going,

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Tom, with this theory of all
these mushrooms and things

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, I've
actually read his books.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:10%
I know his work pretty well.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:10%
He believes that Jesus
was really just a mushroom

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:10%
experience, that there wasn't
actually a historical Jesus.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: And that the--

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't say
that the Christians.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, the good
news for the Christians

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
is, whether you're a Christian
or not, it's just not true.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Most historians would agree
that there was probably

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.048 align:middle line:84%
somebody named Jesus
walking around at that time.

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who did things--

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Who did things that
definitely annoyed the Roman

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:84%
guard, because you
have pagan authors who

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.423 align:middle line:90%
write about his execution.

00:21:45.423 --> 00:21:46.223 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:21:46.223 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So there's
something there.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's just too
much of a disconnect.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And when I read his books,
his book, "The Mushroom

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:84%
in Christian Art,"
he makes a lot

00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:84%
of very compelling
arguments, but he

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:90%
doesn't cite any of them.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And just being a
historian and dealing

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:84%
with medieval studies for
the better part of 15 years

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
or so, it's just-- it's really
easy to kind of read and say

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.960 align:middle line:84%
that this is bunk
in the same way

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
if somebody tried to offer
me a copy of Cinderella,

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:20.760 align:middle line:84%
then tell me it's
real, well, I know

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.790 align:middle line:84%
that pumpkins don't grow that
big and turn into stagecoaches.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's really-- it's kind
of the same with them.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.650 align:middle line:84%
They're attractive books,
though, and it's intriguing.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.300 align:middle line:90%
And I used to believe all of it.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:90%
But part of--

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think he
believes what he wrote?

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: I don't know.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't actually know
if what they believe,

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:90%
or what they don't believe--

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I like to give him the
benefit of the doubt.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.365 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I don't
think he's dishonest.

00:22:44.365 --> 00:22:47.205 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's more probable
that he really believes this

00:22:47.205 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:90%
and just completely lacks--

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's his
interpretation.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.052 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, he just doesn't
have the training to actually

00:22:52.052 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:84%
interpret those images
in a way that scholars

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.250 align:middle line:90%
would take seriously.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about medieval magic

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and how that fits
into the equation.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.150 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things we do know
about from medieval times--

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and this actually ties into how
we know this is probably not

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:84%
accurate-- is that medieval
Christians wrote openly

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:90%
about their entheogenic use.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.550 align:middle line:90%
They wrote about using cannabis.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.200 align:middle line:90%
They wrote about using opium.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:90%
They wrote about using mandrake.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:90%
They wrote about using henbane.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
mention the mushroom?

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't make
any sense at all.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.180 align:middle line:84%
One text in particular known as
the Trudperter Hohelied which

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
just means the
Trudpert Song of Songs,

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:84%
is very intriguing
because it paints mandrake

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.300 align:middle line:84%
with entheogenic
Christian symbolism.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I actually have part
of it memorized.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.570 align:middle line:84%
It says, "The bark of
mandrake brings intoxication.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
This root denotes
God, the image of whom

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:84%
is Christ, for He is a
medicine and a security

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:90%
for eternal life.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:84%
The root's bark is the Holy
Ghost, and He," meaning Jesus,

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:84%
"is the numbing
vapor that you feel

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:59.500 align:middle line:90%
after drinking the mandrake."

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So here we have highly
entheogenic Christian symbolism

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
built into this, and yet
there's no mention of a mushroom

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.150 align:middle line:90%
anywhere.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: Not you.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I think it's all
pretty straightforward that

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Christians--

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.547 align:middle line:84%
and they could have been
using mushrooms, of course.

00:24:16.547 --> 00:24:17.413 align:middle line:90%
I don't deny that.

00:24:17.413 --> 00:24:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I just deny that they were
secretly hiding in an art

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.057 align:middle line:84%
because there's no reason
to secretly hide it in art.

00:24:22.057 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't a war on drugs yet.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.400 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't Nancy Reagan yet.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't "Reefer
Madness" yet.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
There was no reason
to cover this up.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:90%
And again, they wrote open--

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Theodoret was a bishop of
Syria who wrote openly, yeah,

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.077 align:middle line:84%
I like to smoke opium
and read from the Gospels

00:24:38.077 --> 00:24:39.410 align:middle line:90%
to look for the hidden meanings.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:43.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like, so why not
write about mushrooms too?

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
the true purpose

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.940 align:middle line:90%
of alchemists of that era?

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: So the true
purpose of alchemy

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.480 align:middle line:84%
was the idea to uncover the
hidden pathway of evolution,

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.280 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Alchemists famously tried
to turn led into gold.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:90%
We've all heard of this.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:84%
But why were they trying
to turn lead into gold?

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Because according to alchemists,
gold was just highly evolved

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.390 align:middle line:90%
led.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:84%
All gold started as led, then
became copper, then became

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.580 align:middle line:90%
silver, then became gold.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, this worked for the
alchemists themselves.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.380 align:middle line:84%
They were Neoplatonists,
meaning that they

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.920 align:middle line:84%
believed in a hierarchy
of angelic beings.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And by discovering the right
formulas and potions to drink,

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.600 align:middle line:84%
they could attain or
get to that next level

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.770 align:middle line:90%
in their own evolution.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And this could involve
things like mushroom use.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.930 align:middle line:84%
A colleague of mine,
PD Newman, just

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
released an article
about mushroom use

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:90%
in alchemy treatises.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.120 align:middle line:90%
So they were familiar with them.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.500 align:middle line:90%
And one treatise in particular--

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
the thing about alchemy, it's
hard because they colored--

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:90%
how can I put this?

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Alchemists were very
secretive because we're

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.020 align:middle line:84%
talking about things like
turning lead into gold

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:90%
or achieving immortality.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:90%
This is powerful stuff.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They protected
the things they did.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: They did.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they did it through
kind of mystical poetry.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So as one example, one
book, the book of Ripley,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:84%
writes about a toad he
saw drunk red off wine.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, he probably is
referring to a mushroom,

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.770 align:middle line:84%
because he calls it a medicine
that can heal and kill.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:84%
We also know that toads
have a long association

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.390 align:middle line:90%
with the Amanita muscaria, i.e.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:90%
the toad stool.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So a toad drunk
red on wine, that--

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I think he's-- that Ripley was
referring to a mushroom there.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the King
James Bible make reference

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.990 align:middle line:90%
to some of these things too?

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yes, in
the areas where

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.890 align:middle line:90%
they talk about kaneh-bosm.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.440 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is, so
during King James's time,

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I had mentioned
earlier kaneh-bosm was

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.490 align:middle line:90%
the Hebrew word for cannabis.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So when the Greeks in the third
century before the common era

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:84%
were writing the
Septuagint, which

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.480 align:middle line:84%
is the Greek version
of the Old Testament,

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
there was a mishap
with the translation,

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and kaneh-bosm was
translated as calamus, which

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:90%
is a marshy, reedlike plant.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And so when King James
was writing his Bible,

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:90%
he used that--

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
earlier translations that
actually said calamus.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.555 align:middle line:84%
So he never actually
wrote kaneh-bosm,

00:27:10.555 --> 00:27:11.555 align:middle line:90%
which would be cannabis.

00:27:11.555 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:90%

so at the same time,

when you look at

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:10%
what an incredible mind
many think to be the actual,

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.120 align:middle line:10%
at least part of, or if not,
the better part of a body

of Shakespeare's work,
authorship of that--

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:10%
I think that's, in the
intelligentsia circles,

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.040 align:middle line:10%
is kind of accepted-- but
then also under contract

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.400 align:middle line:10%
to rewrite the King James
version of the Bible.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.390 align:middle line:10%
And again, how did
you perceive that part

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.030 align:middle line:10%
of his role in the world,
to rewrite the Bible

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:10%
into this everlasting, at least
the last few years, King James

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.420 align:middle line:10%
version of the Bible?

>>JASON LOUV: Well, it's
a fascinating question.

And there was so much
going on at this time.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.792 align:middle line:84%
Those guys, both Bacon,
Shakespeare, John D-- yeah,

00:28:00.792 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:84%
of course they were
all working together.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.757 align:middle line:10%
There was a lot going on
behind the scenes that is--

00:28:04.757 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:10%
some of which is historically
accepted and some of which

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.230 align:middle line:10%
is conjecture.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's just very clear to
me, observing that period

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.870 align:middle line:84%
in history, that there
was a group of very, very

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:84%
intelligent people, a real
intelligencia, who were working

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:84%
with everything they had to
modernize Europe and bring

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:27.910 align:middle line:84%
new ideas of spirituality and
scientific advance and world

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:31.300 align:middle line:84%
exploration and art and drama,
in the case of Shakespeare,

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.122 align:middle line:84%
and then yes, the
modernization of the Bible.

00:28:34.122 --> 00:28:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And the fascinating
thing about all these

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.530 align:middle line:84%
is the real common
thread with all of them

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:42.340 align:middle line:84%
is the faith in the
liberation of human beings

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.340 align:middle line:84%
from superstition and control,
the idea that human beings

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:84%
should be free to
pursue happiness,

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:84%
to pursue scientific truth,
to pursue religious truth

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:90%
on their own terms.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ideas
that became America.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.550 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
were manifested finally

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:84%
as the United States, which
was a project of these guys,

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.960 align:middle line:90%

here you have this--

again, this has withstood
some test of time, of the--

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:20.230 align:middle line:10%
last I read that there were
26,000 versions of the New

Testament alone that exist.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.540 align:middle line:10%
But in this particular
one, the dominant one,

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.060 align:middle line:10%
it's used almost in a
fundamentalist way because

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.950 align:middle line:10%
of our lack of
nuance in thinking.

intelligence point of view,

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:36.760 align:middle line:10%
it's said to be written

see that it actually

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Under the guise
of Christianity, or--

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Some people, yeah,
did absolutely mix Christianity

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.440 align:middle line:90%
with pagan traditions.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.760 align:middle line:90%
That happened quite a lot.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.035 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was hard
pressed to find

00:30:48.035 --> 00:30:49.660 align:middle line:84%
a case, when I was
writing "The Witch's

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Ointment," for a wise
woman who didn't have

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:56.590 align:middle line:84%
some kind of Christian lore
wrapped up in her own folk

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.653 align:middle line:90%
beliefs and her own folk magic.

00:30:58.653 --> 00:31:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it
dangerous for them

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:90%
to practice this in this era?

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh yes.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I thought.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Absolutely,
yeah, yeah, absolutely

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.630 align:middle line:84%
dangerous to practice,
especially by the time

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.960 align:middle line:84%
King James was writing, I
believe the early 1600s.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.100 align:middle line:84%
That's where the wheels
of the witch hunts

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:19.480 align:middle line:84%
were really at their strongest,
was between, I would say,

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:90%
1550 to 1650.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.823 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could find
yourself killed with this.

00:31:23.823 --> 00:31:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I would have been
first at the stake being

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:90%
burned in those days.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.222 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They would
have gotten you, right?

00:31:29.222 --> 00:31:31.638 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Because I play Derby,
I could maybe outrun them,

00:31:31.638 --> 00:31:32.438 align:middle line:90%
but they'd--

00:31:32.438 --> 00:31:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'd
catch you eventually.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, eventually
they'd catch me.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's jump
ahead to today.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Are these modern issues
being used today, plants

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:43.925 align:middle line:84%
and psychedelics and
things like that?

00:31:43.925 --> 00:31:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Absolutely.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still?

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:46.547 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In what way?

00:31:46.547 --> 00:31:46.675 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Absolutely.

00:31:46.675 --> 00:31:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So I had mentioned
earlier a friend of mine

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.790 align:middle line:84%
who eats mushrooms to open
up portals to communicate

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.190 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's one way people do it.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.780 align:middle line:84%
In Portland, where
I'm from, there

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:03.910 align:middle line:84%
is a person named Pa Dammit who
runs what he calls the Shamanic

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:08.795 align:middle line:84%
Cabaret, where it's the six-hour
show of Joseph Campbell's hero

00:32:08.795 --> 00:32:09.595 align:middle line:90%
journey.

00:32:09.595 --> 00:32:10.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Six hours?

00:32:10.405 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Six-hour rock
concert that this guy

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:84%
puts on by himself to
kind of guide people

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.930 align:middle line:84%
through an entheogenic
experience with a backdrop

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:20.972 align:middle line:90%
of the hero's journey.

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it well attended?

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.972 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It is-- yeah,
it's well attended,

00:32:23.972 --> 00:32:26.380 align:middle line:90%
and it is just remarkable.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.560 align:middle line:84%
There's also, then, the kind
of weird things that I do,

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.770 align:middle line:84%
because I also use these plant
medicines in my practices.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.005 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Gaian worshiper.

00:32:34.005 --> 00:32:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Go figure, we're
at Gaia Studios.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But I actually am a
worshiper of Gaia,

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:39.280 align:middle line:90%
she who created the universe.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And I use plant
medicines to be correct--

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.990 align:middle line:90%
direct communication with her.

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been one
of the strangest experiences

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.900 align:middle line:84%
for you, Tom, under
the psychedelics?

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: The strangest.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:55.450 align:middle line:84%
After my life, it's kind
of nothing's too strange.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.900 align:middle line:90%
But let's see.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:84%
A few months ago, when I was
in communication with Gaia,

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:84%
she was-- we were talking
about strengths and weaknesses

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:90%
in the individual.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And she was talking
to me about--

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.340 align:middle line:84%
she asked me to grab
this, just, object

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.720 align:middle line:90%
I was sitting on a table.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
well, I'm going for it.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.890 align:middle line:90%
And she said, no.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Use your left hand.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.280 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, I'm right handed.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.725 align:middle line:84%
Well, one's my
non-dominant hand,

00:33:22.725 --> 00:33:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and the other's
my dominant hand.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.450 align:middle line:90%
And she said, you're wrong.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a
non-dominant hand.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And then she literally turned
my left arm into a lion's paw.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:36.185 align:middle line:84%
So I have a dominant right hand
and a dominant left lion's paw.

00:33:36.185 --> 00:33:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.998 align:middle line:90%
What is microdosing?

00:33:38.998 --> 00:33:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Microdosing
is the practice

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:46.270 align:middle line:84%
of taking very small amounts
of things like mushrooms or LSD

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:49.720 align:middle line:84%
to get the medical
benefits of it,

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.552 align:middle line:84%
which is more energy,
antidepressive effects

00:33:53.552 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:90%
that they have as well.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anti-anxiety,
that stuff.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.138 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Anti-anxiety, yeah.

00:33:57.138 --> 00:33:58.690 align:middle line:90%
The list goes on and on.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And so microdosing is just a
way to take these small amounts

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:03.815 align:middle line:90%
that are imperceptible.

00:34:03.815 --> 00:34:05.440 align:middle line:84%
When somebody takes
a microdose, you're

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.220 align:middle line:90%
not feeling anything at all.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.239 align:middle line:84%
It's just working really beneath
the surface and just kind

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.172 align:middle line:90%
of fixing some things.

00:34:12.172 --> 00:34:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at microdosing.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:14.737 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:34:14.737 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:17.850 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE MORTER: is microdosing?

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.850 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL AUSTIN: So microdosing
is the consumption

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.179 align:middle line:10%
of a low dose of a
psychedelic, usually two times

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.610 align:middle line:10%
per week for a set
period of time,

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.260 align:middle line:10%
like five weeks or 10 weeks.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.449 align:middle line:10%
When I did it, I did
it for seven months.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:32.510 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is that
it's sub-perceptible.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.960 align:middle line:10%
So you might notice that
there's a slight change in how

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.750 align:middle line:10%
you go about your daily life,
but there's no visual changes.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:10%
You kind of feel like
everything's just a little

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:46.050 align:middle line:10%
elevated, like everything
sparkles a little bit.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.139 align:middle line:10%
And so basically,
the way microdosing

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:51.920 align:middle line:10%
came about was in
2012, a guy named

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Jim Fadiman published a
book called "The Psychedelic

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.909 align:middle line:10%
Explorer's Guide."

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:57.385 align:middle line:84%
And he included a
chapter in there

00:34:57.385 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:84%
on microdosing that talked
about the experiences

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.850 align:middle line:84%
that people had
with microdosing,

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.010 align:middle line:90%
a number of anecdotal reports.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2015, he was
on a very popular podcast.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it sort of came
out into the cultural sphere,

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and you had everyone in Silicon
Valley, tech executives,

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:84%
founders who
started to microdose

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.940 align:middle line:84%
to help with productivity and
creativity, things like that.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: how does that
microdose experience

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.930 align:middle line:84%
differ from the high dose
experience for the individual?

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So the
best way to explain

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:31.040 align:middle line:84%
the difference between a
microdose and a high dose

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.840 align:middle line:84%
is with a high dose, it's like
someone is screaming at you.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.100 align:middle line:84%
They're shaking at you to get
the message of connection,

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.550 align:middle line:90%
of source.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And that can be very
jarring for people at times

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.070 align:middle line:84%
because it's like a
180 from everyday life.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Whereas with microdosing,
it's like someone

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.250 align:middle line:90%
is whispering at you.

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's soft, and it's calm,
and you can integrate it

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.320 align:middle line:90%
on an ongoing basis.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I like to compare microdosing
to mindfulness meditation.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.900 align:middle line:84%
People are noticing
very similar effects

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.635 align:middle line:84%
when they meditate consistently
as when they microdose.

00:35:59.635 --> 00:36:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
really the best way

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.080 align:middle line:84%
to describe the differences
between the two.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then inside that
microdosing experience,

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.830 align:middle line:84%
what are people
subjectively reporting

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:12.820 align:middle line:84%
what happens inside
of them for that?

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So the core
thing to pay attention

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:84%
to when people
are microdosing is

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:84%
they have enhanced
sense of presence.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's less of a
fixation on the past.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.220 align:middle line:84%
There's less of a fixation
on the future, both of which

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.290 align:middle line:84%
are tied to either
depression in the past

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:28.950 align:middle line:90%
or anxiety in the future.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's more of an
ability just to be here now,

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.730 align:middle line:84%
to be present with
everything that's going on.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's
why so many people

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.870 align:middle line:84%
are microdosing with things
like meditation or yoga,

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.020 align:middle line:84%
because those practices
when combined can really

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.540 align:middle line:84%
help to maintain that
sense of presence.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we scope,
kind of zoom outside

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.730 align:middle line:84%
of that, microdosing
people are microdosing

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.050 align:middle line:90%
to help with depression.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.910 align:middle line:84%
They're microdosing
to help with PTSD.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.160 align:middle line:10%
They're microdosing to help with
high levels of social anxiety,

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:58.960 align:middle line:10%
for example.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.335 align:middle line:10%
And then you also
have people who

00:37:00.335 --> 00:37:02.390 align:middle line:10%
are microdosing to
help with creativity,

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.540 align:middle line:10%
to help with leadership,
to help with productivity.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.900 align:middle line:10%
And essentially, when
you're microdosing,

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.820 align:middle line:10%
it's just a little
bit easier to access

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.530 align:middle line:10%
what we call a flow state.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.540 align:middle line:10%
And so kind of a flow state
is when you get in the zone.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:10%
You're able to just drop
into what you're doing

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.060 align:middle line:10%
and just to be there with
it and to go into it.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:10%
And that's when creativity
and productivity combine,

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.880 align:middle line:10%
and we're able to really
focus on the project

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.530 align:middle line:10%
at hand to be able to do
it as well as possible.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:31.247 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's Paul
Austin, a friend of yours

00:37:31.247 --> 00:37:34.470 align:middle line:84%
who talks very similarly
to what you've been saying.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.030 align:middle line:84%
He's really been the
champion of microdosing.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I would say that he
mentioned Paul Fadiman.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.160 align:middle line:90%
Paul Fadiman threw that ball.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Paul Austin caught
it, and he's been

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:47.040 align:middle line:90%
running with it ever since.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.498 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, why
does there appear

00:37:48.498 --> 00:37:53.430 align:middle line:84%
to be a taboo that
encompasses psychedelics?

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Mostly--
and I hope I don't

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.990 align:middle line:84%
upset too many of your
viewers when I say this--

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:01.020 align:middle line:84%
but mostly, it has
to do with the 1960s.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:05.340 align:middle line:84%
The 1960s was actually the only
time in all of human history

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.840 align:middle line:84%
that these medicines were
not revered for the medicines

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.640 align:middle line:90%
that they are.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And people weren't using them
in reverential, spiritual

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.810 align:middle line:90%
contexts.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.840 align:middle line:84%
They weren't trying to get
in touch with Gaia or Jesus,

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:90%
if that's your thing.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.215 align:middle line:84%
They were using it as a
party drug and realizing--

00:38:22.215 --> 00:38:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To get high.

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:24.257 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, to get high.

00:38:24.257 --> 00:38:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, acid,
LSD, that's not beer.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you think you can just go
to a house party and take acid

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.820 align:middle line:84%
the way you'd fill
up a beer at a keg--

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and people are having
really bad reactions.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.060 align:middle line:90%
It's endangering.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are jumping
out of buildings sometimes,

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.922 align:middle line:90%
in some cases.

00:38:41.922 --> 00:38:43.407 align:middle line:90%
That happened.

00:38:43.407 --> 00:38:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Only Ralph Metzner did
that, from what I understand.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The CIA guy, right?

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Oh no,
that was Frank Olson.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:49.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You remember that?

00:38:49.335 --> 00:38:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: He was
pushed out, I think.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of those guys.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I think Frank Olson was
pushed out of that window.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But so unfortunately,
what happened

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:58.600 align:middle line:90%
is you have mass media.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.380 align:middle line:84%
You also had the mass
production of television.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was
America's first real look

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:12.630 align:middle line:84%
at these substances, at
these plant medicines,

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:17.070 align:middle line:84%
was in a highly biased media
controlled kind of way.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And everybody today-- Paul
Austin, myself, Martin Ball,

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:22.350 align:middle line:90%
who you've interviewed as well--

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.650 align:middle line:84%
we're all working
double time to try

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:29.220 align:middle line:84%
to show that, no, these
are actually really--

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I think mystical experiences
are good for people.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:32.678 align:middle line:90%
I think they are.

00:39:32.678 --> 00:39:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you're missing
out if you're not having one.

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even mean just
by using psychedelics.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean just having--

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:41.370 align:middle line:84%
a naturally occurring
mystical appearance

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:42.600 align:middle line:90%
is great for a person.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.820 align:middle line:84%
But all of that mysticism
and that ideology

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.740 align:middle line:90%
got wrapped up in psychedelia.

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So then people looked at
even that kind of stuff

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.970 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, that's
woo woo or whatever.

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's like no, there's
actually a lot to it.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.797 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
recommend that people

00:39:54.797 --> 00:39:58.963 align:middle line:84%
get in touch with that outside
world through psychedelics?

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I don't recommend
anybody ever take psychedelics

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:01.770 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do not.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:08.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to, yes,
try to have a reverential

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:09.550 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I say prayers
before I take mine.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.770 align:middle line:90%
There's incense that I light.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:17.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole thing that I do
before I eat my mushrooms.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But I think that they're--
as long as people know what

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.690 align:middle line:84%
they're doing, they're
educated on the topic,

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.510 align:middle line:84%
they don't have a history
of mental illness either

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:32.220 align:middle line:84%
in themselves or their family,
they have a friend that's right

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.680 align:middle line:84%
there with them that can
help, that perhaps has had

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.900 align:middle line:90%
experiences before--

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to
keep us out of trouble

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:90%
by saying no, don't eat any.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about a
person who's got schizophrenia?

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Should he use these?

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: I don't think so.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so at all.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's good advice.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I think even somebody
with mild schizophrenia or--

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.840 align:middle line:84%
it's one of those, talk
to your doctor about it.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.520 align:middle line:84%
See, that's one of the problems
with all the restrictions in--

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hey doc, I want to eat
these psychedelic mushrooms.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.245 align:middle line:90%
But a doctor will say no.

00:41:05.245 --> 00:41:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Not always.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: There's a
whole underground world

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.780 align:middle line:84%
of doctors out in America
and Canada and Mexico that--

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and in Europe, all over
the place-- that are,

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
they're psychedelic
psychotherapists.

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
your website, Tom,

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.180 align:middle line:84%
for people who might want
to track you and follow you?

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.180 align:middle line:10%
So if they're interested
in the psychedelic library,

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.840 align:middle line:10%
which is the biggest repository
of psychedelic literature,

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.590 align:middle line:10%
that's psanctum.com,
but psanctum with a P.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:31.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: With a P.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.240 align:middle line:10%
>>HATSIS: And my
work can be found

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.920 align:middle line:10%
at PsychedelicHistorian.com.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.400 align:middle line:10%
That's where the books I write
and upcoming events, things

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.280 align:middle line:10%
like that, will be,
articles I've written.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.930 align:middle line:84%
But most of that
stuff is eventually

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:44.890 align:middle line:84%
going to be moved over
to the Psanctum website.

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So in like a month or so,
that's going to be the only one.

being on Beyond Belief.

>>HATSIS: Thank you
so much, George.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.040 align:middle line:90%
This was amazing.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.498 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I learned
a lot from this.

00:41:52.498 --> 00:41:55.980 align:middle line:84%
I always thought psychedelics
were totally bad.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.908 align:middle line:84%
Just talking to you,
they really aren't.

00:41:57.908 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: No they're not.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:00.430 align:middle line:90%
They're like any other tool.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.210 align:middle line:84%
You could use a hammer to
build a nice table for someone,

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:middle line:84%
or you could clock them
over the head with it.

>>NOORY: Does it get
us closer to God?

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I would say it gets
us closer to Gaia, but yes.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:10.930 align:middle line:90%
I think it does.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that for
thousands of years,

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:84%
people have been
using these medicines

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:18.270 align:middle line:84%
to get themselves closer
to that divine being,

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.530 align:middle line:90%

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.260 align:middle line:10%
