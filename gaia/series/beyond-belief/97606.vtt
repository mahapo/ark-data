00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.408 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.305 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:25.095 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to this edition

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief," as we
talk tonight about astrology.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:10%
Heather Arielle, of
course, is with us.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:84%
She is running
Arielle's Astrology.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.317 align:middle line:84%
And what a fascinating
subject-- I love this stuff.

00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in astrology?

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:10%
>>HEATHER ARIELLE: Well, I had
a reading many years ago just,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:10%
you know, out of curiosity.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:10%
And what happens when you
find a good astrologer

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.540 align:middle line:10%
and you get a reading, you
quickly find out that it works.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:10%
So then I just delved into
it, and I read more and more.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I just,
through learning

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and through
experience, said, OK.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.811 align:middle line:90%
This is-- I'm gonna do this.

00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
what I want to do.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:84%
How did you know that she
or he was a good astrologer?

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, I didn't.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It was actually
just-- oh, I'm just--

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:84%
It was just a
moment where I just

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:90%
said, let me just go do this.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who had
it done, and it was fun.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was really only
after having it done

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and then seeing what
happened, I said,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.530 align:middle line:84%
oh, my gosh, there's
really a lot to this.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:90%
And then I just went back.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And she's Mary
Keswani, and she's

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:90%
a very prominent astrologer.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:90%
And she's just wonderful.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've ended up
learning so much from her.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
astrology, of course,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:84%
a little different
from numerology, right?

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Where numerology is
dealing with your birth

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
date, and your
numbers, and stuff.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Astrology-- primarily what?

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:84%
The mood of what the
stars were and the planets

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:90%
when you were born?

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Exactly right.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Numerology-- it really does.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.610 align:middle line:90%
It's all about numbers.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And with astrology,
really it's the snapshot

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos the
moment you were born.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all about your natal chart.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
create your natal chart.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So the first question an
astrologers asks is well,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:90%
when were you born?

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And not just the day,
month, year, but we

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:84%
really want to get as
exact a time as possible.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So with
computers now, Heather,

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I guess you can sit back
and type this all in,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.516 align:middle line:84%
and you can see what
exactly the patterns were

00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:28.640 align:middle line:90%
during that person's birth.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It's
changed everything.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
You can make charts
so quickly now,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:90%
and you can animate charts.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So you're really able to
look many years ahead just

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.020 align:middle line:84%
at a glance, and it ends
up being so helpful.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And it also has brought
more people into it

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:84%
because astrology
is complicated.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And so now, people
who have an interest

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.540 align:middle line:84%
are actually able to
learn quite a lot.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's been very
good for astrology.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let's talk about
the astrology and why it works.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one would
think, oh, come

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
on now, the positions of
planets and everything

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:84%
else during my
birth-- that's nice,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.519 align:middle line:84%
but how does that determine
who I am or what I will be?

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well it
is hard to believe.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I first
had my reading,

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:84%
it was just as a lot of
people do, it's something fun.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But just because we don't
understand the mechanism

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
by which something
works, it doesn't

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:90%
mean that it doesn't work.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:84%
You see this a lot
of time in medicine.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Doctors can prescribe
certain medicines.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's proof that
it has a certain effect

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:84%
even though they don't
completely understand

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.779 align:middle line:90%
the mechanism all the time.

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
through experience--

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:84%
have your chart done, and
you'll see that it does.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.132 align:middle line:84%
And it really doesn't
matter exactly why.

00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
something called

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.685 align:middle line:90%
a bad astrological chart?

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Well, OK.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Each planet and each
sign-- there is a duality.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So I would never say,
this is a bad chart.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Charts can be afflicted
because we really

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.702 align:middle line:84%
have-- people are very
familiar with their sun sign.

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And people will
say, I'm a Scorpio.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Gemini.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:90%
But we really have--

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm a Gemini.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: I'm a Gemini too.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:84%
But we really have
five personal planets.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to look
at all of those planets.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And within each planet, there is
the high road and the low road.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.455 align:middle line:84%
This is where free
will comes in.

00:04:22.455 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people, sometimes
when they come to me,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:84%
they say, OK tell me
what's going to happen,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.702 align:middle line:90%
as if it's just all fated.

00:04:30.702 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, well,
I will tell you

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:90%
the choices that you will face.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you the
areas where you

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
may face a particular
challenge or obstacle.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But as always, we
have free will.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And if we activate that, we can
activate the highest potential

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:90%
in our chart.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:90%
So you can't blame it.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:84%
If you do something bad, you
cannot blame it on the chart.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Some people have to work harder
if you have an afflicted chart.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you have hard aspects--
that some aspects are

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:90%
very harmonious.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why some people
are born with-- oh, I

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
can just play the piano and
I never had to take a lesson.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Well that's a beautiful,
harmonious aspect in the chart.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.542 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they were
the reincarnated Mozart.

00:05:11.542 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Absolutely.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we come back over and
over to learn and develop.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is our destiny
already determined

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.985 align:middle line:90%
by our astrological chart?

00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do we have
a choice here?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Absolutely.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:90%
We always have a choice.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But the North Node--
that is what really I--

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of astrologers--
we say, well, if we want

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.750 align:middle line:90%
to see what is the destiny?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Another way of saying that--
the soul comes in to each life.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:90%
What does the soul need?

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is represented
by the North Node.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So we do want to see, well,
what house does that fall in?

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Because every natal chart
is broken into 12 houses.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So if that North Node is up
at the top of the chart, which

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
is a very prominent
position, the soul

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
needs to have a
public experience,

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
that whatever that
soul comes in to do,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:84%
that soul needs to share
it with the public.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So I would encourage the
client to follow that path.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's up to you to do it.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
amazing how it works.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.472 align:middle line:90%
It really, really is.

00:06:17.472 --> 00:06:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: It is.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you look
at an astrological chart,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
have you ever looked
at it, Heather,

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
to a point where
you go, oh my gosh!

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.961 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell this person this!

00:06:30.961 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well there certainly
are very serious aspects--

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.307 align:middle line:90%
catastrophic illness--

00:06:37.307 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not all fun!

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, absolutely not.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's all about what is
the person ready to hear?

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
What can I say that can
really inspire this person

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:84%
to reach his or
her full potential?

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And I really like to think of
astrology as opening doors.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well when
astrology opens a door,

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
it's important to
walk through it.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So I make them
very aware of this

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.605 align:middle line:90%
is the energy that's coming in.

00:07:04.605 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
You can have a very
stressful health aspect.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
during this period,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.375 align:middle line:84%
it's a time then not to
overstress your body.

00:07:12.375 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:84%
There are very specific
times when you should

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.760 align:middle line:90%
make sure you get enough sleep.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%
If you begin to get sick,
you need to go to the doctor.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't put it off.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
There are times when
you can put it off.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So you have to find a very
gentle way of how can you

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
share the information
that can inspire

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.564 align:middle line:84%
them to use their free will
and make a positive change.

00:07:33.564 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't ever
want to scare them.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
used astrology for couples?

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they want to
see if they match up.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.140 align:middle line:84%
It's very common, and
it's very effective.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:84%
It's called synastry--
there are a couple.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.681 align:middle line:84%
You can use synastry,
and then you can also

00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:49.280 align:middle line:90%
use the composite chart.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Synastry is simply
a way-- I'll have

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:90%
the two charts in front of me.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I look at the planets
in one person's chart,

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and then I compare them to the
planets in the other person's

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:90%
chart.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, do
they make relationships?

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
If so, are they
harmonious relationships,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:90%
or are they combative?

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And then well,
where do the planets

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:90%
fall in each person's house?

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
house for marriage.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So if it's a romantic couple,
if one person's planets falls

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
in the other person's
house of marriage,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.710 align:middle line:84%
that person's going to
see his or her partner

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:90%
as a real marriage partner.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But if that person's
planets fall

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:84%
in maybe the house
of romance, it

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
doesn't quite see
the other person

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:84%
as a significant relationship,
more as fun and games.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.045 align:middle line:90%
And so it's very revealing.

00:08:41.045 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
use astrology, Heather,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.330 align:middle line:90%
most of the time?

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Most of the time,
it's on a very personal basis.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I help people understand
their natal chart

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and then understand the
energy that's coming in,

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.315 align:middle line:84%
how they can activate
their highest potential.

00:08:57.315 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you try to
make recommendations to them,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.072 align:middle line:90%
do they listen?

00:09:04.072 --> 00:09:05.395 align:middle line:90%
Do they pick up on them?

00:09:05.395 --> 00:09:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well,
those are things

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:90%
that I really can't control.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.970 align:middle line:90%
But that does show in the chart.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.180 align:middle line:84%
If there's a lot of
fixity in a chart,

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:84%
then I know I have to be
very gentle because there

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.670 align:middle line:90%
can be a resistance to change.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But if there's a lot
of mutability-- Gemini,

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius, Pisces-- there's
adaptability, a mutability.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:84%
There's ability to process
information very quickly.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So how I speak to a client
depends on what I see,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:90%
how I give that advice.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, when you
look at the astrological charts

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
of people and the
astrological signs,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I know with myself
being the Gemini,

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:84%
the Gemini being the
twins, I sometimes have

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:90%
two different personalities.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.400 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of uncanny.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes wonder
if everybody has

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:90%
two different personalities.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.225 align:middle line:90%
One of my daughters is a Taurus.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So she's somewhat
bullish and stubborn.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough, she is.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.610 align:middle line:10%
So it's kind of uncanny how
these astrological charts

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:10%
and symbols determine what
that personality seems to be.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.580 align:middle line:10%
I can't figure it out, but
it's pretty close-- how come?

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well it's not that
it so much completely determines

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle line:84%
the personality, but we come
in with such specific energy.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So Gemini can then
color-- Gemini

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:90%
is so playful and curious.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And if it hits your sun,
that affects your very ego.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And then if the
energy hits your moon,

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:84%
that's going to affect your
emotional life, how we respond.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.814 align:middle line:84%
And then Mars-- that's
really the planet of action.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And it tells me
whether somebody's

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:84%
going to be passive-aggressive,
assertive, even violent,

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:90%
or even conflict-avoidant.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and then depending on
the sign-- so Pisces in Mars.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Mars doesn't really like to be
in Pisces, because Mars likes

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.650 align:middle line:90%
to go just full steam ahead.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Mars likes to be in Aries.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that's going
to tell me this person

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:84%
may need a little bit
more encouragement

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:90%
to initiate and to move forward.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
sometimes backed

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
into an astrological
report inasmuch

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:84%
as to test how accurate it is
because it's already happened?

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So you would say
something like, OK,

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
this person's a Gemini,
and these things

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:90%
I see in the chart.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
But then you look at
what they're doing,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.215 align:middle line:84%
and you say, yeah, it matches
up-- where you backdated it.

00:11:40.215 --> 00:11:42.125 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, absolutely.

00:11:42.125 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Especially, when I have
several clients because I'm

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.170 align:middle line:84%
an astrological counselor--
so a lot of my clients,

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:90%
I speak to them quite often.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And we do-- we go back
over monumental moments

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always looking at what's
going on because astrology

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.590 align:middle line:90%
is really about cycles.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.235 align:middle line:84%
So Saturn, every 29
years, we know Saturn's

00:12:00.235 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:90%
going to go around our chart.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Every 12 years, Jupiter is
going to go around our chart.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we have chance
to experience it again.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So I always talk
about, so how was

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:84%
that experience when Jupiter
was at the top of your chart?

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.649 align:middle line:90%
It's a mini-high watermark.

00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to say,
well, was that person

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.207 align:middle line:90%
able to achieve that potential?

00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:21.790 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, well,
it's coming up again.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the time to
expand your public persona

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:90%
or expand your career.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
to know how you

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.030 align:middle line:90%
have responded to past energy.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.119 align:middle line:84%
Because for the
most part, you're

00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:37.285 align:middle line:90%
going to get another chance.

00:12:37.285 --> 00:12:38.076 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:12:38.076 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at me.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.555 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE (laughing): OK!

00:12:40.555 --> 00:12:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let's see
how accurate it is.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.014 align:middle line:84%
And I'll try to be
as honest as I can.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.054 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, of course!

00:12:46.054 --> 00:12:47.059 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As I always am.

00:12:47.059 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, absolutely, and
there's honesty in your chart,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.000 align:middle line:90%
so I would expect nothing less.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:10%
So yes, and you've mentioned--
so you have the Gemini sun--

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:10%
Mercury rules Gemini.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:10%
So already, that's
excellent for communication.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:10%
But it's just your
sun is in Gemini.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:08.160 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting because
anything Mercury touches,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.960 align:middle line:10%
Mercury speeds up.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So since Mercury
rules Gemini, it

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:16.207 align:middle line:84%
means Geminis are
usually-- they can quickly

00:13:16.207 --> 00:13:17.040 align:middle line:90%
process information.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.195 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they're
so good at communicating.

00:13:19.195 --> 00:13:21.864 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting
is-- that was interesting

00:13:21.864 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:84%
that you said that
your daughter's

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.760 align:middle line:84%
a Taurus, because you have a
lot of Taurus in your chart.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Your Mercury, which is the
planet of communication,

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:90%
is in Taurus.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:90%
And that is very grounded.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:90%
It's earthy.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:90%
Taurus slows Mercury down.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.161 align:middle line:84%
So if you have too much Gemini,
you can just talk nonstop.

00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost hard
for people to follow.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.381 align:middle line:84%
There's just a nice, slow
way that you're able--

00:13:49.381 --> 00:13:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a calming.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: There's a
calming stability in the way

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that you speak that,
then, you allow

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.260 align:middle line:84%
people to process what
you say, and that's

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:90%
a very Taurian energy.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:90%
It also says your midheaven.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.740 align:middle line:10%
That is really the
degree that says, well,

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.060 align:middle line:10%
what should this person
be doing as far as career?

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.540 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting
that that is in Taurus.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.430 align:middle line:10%
I would've, just
without knowing,

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:10%
I would have-- a
couple hours later,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:10%
you would have had
a Gemini midheaven.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:10%
But that means it really
is about your voice.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:84%
That part of what you're
supposed to be doing

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.170 align:middle line:84%
is communicating--
but specifically

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:90%
through your voice.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Because Taurus really rules.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:90%
It rules the neck.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.700 align:middle line:90%
It rules the thyroid.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it rules the voice.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So you're probably going
to have a beautiful voice,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.832 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
be very powerful.

00:14:37.832 --> 00:14:40.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY (high-pitched voice):
I'm looking forward to it.

00:14:40.165 --> 00:14:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE (laughing):
Exactly-- just like that!

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And what's also interesting--
your ascendant and your rising

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:90%
sign.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is something-- unless
you get your chart done,

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:84%
people are not that aware of
what their rising sign is.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the
energy we give off

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:90%
when we first meet someone.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So even though you have
this Gemini and Taurus,

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:90%
you give off Leo energy.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the sign of
the entertainer.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Leos are comfortable being in
the public, in front of people.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.660 align:middle line:90%
They like an audience.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is that you have Pluto.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't mentioned
the outer planets.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is Pluto a planet?

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, it,
according to-- in astrology,

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:90%
it's just as powerful.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
anybody wants to call Pluto.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
It does not change the
power that Pluto has.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.124 align:middle line:84%
Just as we can rename
roses tomorrow,

00:15:31.124 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:84%
they're still going
to smell like a rose

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.660 align:middle line:90%
and be as beautiful.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So the outer planets are very
significant in a natal chart

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
when they come in close
contact with a natal planet.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
You have Pluto very
close to your ascendant.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:10%
So yes, you give off Leo energy.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:10%
But because Pluto's there,
it intensifies the effect

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:10%
because anything Pluto touches
intensifies and adds power.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And you do have a powerful
persona that you give off.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And also what falls under
Pluto, the highest manifestation

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:84%
of Plutonian energy
is transformation.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi had powerful
Scorpio Plutonian energy.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Pluto rules Scorpio.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can transform
society for the better.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And in your chart-- because
I always recommend--

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:84%
this is the highest
potential of this chart.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:84%
You communicate
through your voice

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
to transform society
for the better

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:84%
through discussing
taboo subjects.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Because Pluto, really--
it's those subjects

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.977 align:middle line:84%
that you really don't want
to talk about at dinner.

00:16:37.977 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:84%
They're not-- it's not
polite dinner conversation.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.130 align:middle line:84%
These are things that make
people feel uncomfortable.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:90%
But you will have a knack.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:84%
People with a strong
Pluto or Scorpio,

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:84%
they have a knack
for shining a light

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:90%
on these difficult subjects.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So then other people
can understand them.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And also, your
North node-- when we

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:84%
talked about what
your soul needs--

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.990 align:middle line:90%
it's in the eighth house.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Scorpio rules that house.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the house of
transformation.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:84%
That magnifies the Plutonian
energy on your ascendant.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.619 align:middle line:84%
Even the title of this show--
"Beyond Belief--" I mean,

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:90%
those are taboo subjects.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Those are Plutonian themes.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And so you're clearly
activating high potential.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you put together
a chart like this for somebody,

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:90%
do you make recommendations?

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:27.089 align:middle line:84%
Do you ask them to alter
things in their life,

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:90%
or do you just lay it out there?

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, well, I make
them very aware of the duality

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:90%
of the planets.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.904 align:middle line:84%
Especially, I would make them
very aware of Pluto saying, OK,

00:17:36.904 --> 00:17:37.820 align:middle line:90%
this is the high road.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.695 align:middle line:90%
This is the low road.

00:17:38.695 --> 00:17:41.230 align:middle line:84%
You always want to have
awareness that you're

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.830 align:middle line:90%
activating the high road.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
when we're not aware?

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.640 align:middle line:84%
We can slip in to
the low road behavior

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.410 align:middle line:84%
because it's just not
something we're aware of.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I always
suggest to people--

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:84%
but they have to
make that decision.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.986 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:17:58.986 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:90%
I have a business chart.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, you do.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.066 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that.

00:18:03.066 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, anything that
has a beginning has a chart.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people,
they don't realize that.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.020 align:middle line:10%
So your business-- the
moment that you aired

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:10%
your first show-- is a chart.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:10%
And I actually work
with people when

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:10%
they want to open a business
because you can choose it.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle line:10%
So work with a
good astrologer, I

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.360 align:middle line:10%
tell people, if you want
to start a business.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.651 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to be
stuck with this chart for as

00:18:23.651 --> 00:18:25.920 align:middle line:90%
long as this show is going on.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Now I was told the
shows are pretty much

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:90%
available by midnight.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.390 align:middle line:90%
So we did a midnight chart.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So first, I'm just
going to talk about what

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
it is in the business chart,
just as a business chart.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.660 align:middle line:90%
It has a Virgo.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:10%
It's Virgo rising.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.660 align:middle line:10%
And that's interesting
because Mercury

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:10%
rules Virgo, and Mercury
rules communication.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:10%
So for a communications
show, that's all wonderful.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.880 align:middle line:84%
That says the
health of the show.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Now the midheaven is the most
important degree in a business

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.060 align:middle line:84%
chart because that
says it really

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:84%
needs to be in the sign
that rules the business.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was just so
happy when I saw it.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.940 align:middle line:10%
But the midheaven degree--
the sign on the midheaven

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.739 align:middle line:10%
is Gemini-- it's ideal.

00:19:08.739 --> 00:19:09.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Hmm.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:10%
Did I fall into this, or what?

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.690 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: Well, when
you take the higher path,

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:10%
I have found things tend
to-- its divine timing.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Things tend to work out then.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you carry
yourself with awareness

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and you're pursuing that, then
you intuitively just know.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, you had a
wonderful-- Jupiter

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.992 align:middle line:84%
in the chart makes a wonderful
aspect with your moon.

00:19:31.992 --> 00:19:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you're a
public person, the moon

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:84%
represents how you're
perceived in the public.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.600 align:middle line:90%
And that was a chance.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
When this show
aired, you personally

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:84%
were having a chance to
expand your public persona.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So you intuitively knew that
and you took advantage of it.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
chart is working.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Also you want to see
what is Mercury doing?

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.582 align:middle line:84%
Because Mercury rules the
midheaven of this chart.

00:19:54.582 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's in-- thank goodness.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I was so happy-- a beautiful
aspect with Uranus.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.690 align:middle line:90%
Uranus rules technology.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a website,
a radio show, TV,

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:84%
any kind of-- where you're
going to involve communications

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and technology, you need
to see harmonious aspects

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:90%
between Mercury and Uranus.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:13.880 align:middle line:90%
So that's wonderful.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Now the only thing I would say--

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ah, is
there a blip here?

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.262 align:middle line:84%
You're like a doctor going,
you're in pretty good health

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:21.762 align:middle line:90%
except--

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are you
going to tell me here?

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, that it's
not a complete story until I

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.596 align:middle line:90%
put your chart on top of it.

00:20:33.596 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --which I'm
sure you've done--

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, I have.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Because even though a
business chart can be great,

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.310 align:middle line:84%
we need to see what is
the owner, the founder,

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:84%
or in this case when
it's a show, the host.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.747 align:middle line:84%
So the only concern
I had with this chart

00:20:46.747 --> 00:20:48.580 align:middle line:84%
was that so many planets
were at the bottom.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the foundation,
which is wonderful.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, I said oh, I would have
liked more charts at the top.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:84%
But when I put your
chart on top of it

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.880 align:middle line:84%
because you have Gemini and
Taurus, all of your planets

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.320 align:middle line:84%
are on the top of
your business chart.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, you
have a complete chart.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:90%
And that is the ideal.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why you need to really
be looking at both charts that

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:90%
do they complement one another?

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And your Mars-- your
energy-- sits right

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:90%
on top of the ascendant.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.009 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that good?

00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It's
wonderful because you

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.700 align:middle line:90%
have energy for this.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:84%
If the Mars made a
hard aspect, that

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:84%
means the business
could be draining,

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
could be exhausting in a
way that people give up.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But that there's an
alignment between your goals,

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.885 align:middle line:90%
your energy, and the chart.

00:21:35.885 --> 00:21:37.024 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I never give up.

00:21:37.024 --> 00:21:37.940 align:middle line:90%
That's my personality.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well that is--
you have a lot of fixity.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Pluto, Leo, your
moon is an Aquarius--

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:90%
fixed signs have tenacity.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.020 align:middle line:90%
They have that perseverance.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:84%
They are able to follow
through to the end.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:84%
When you have too
much mutability,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of all
over the place.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.086 align:middle line:84%
You start a lot of things,
but you don't necessarily

00:21:56.086 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:90%
finish them.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.526 align:middle line:84%
So that's your
fixity coming out.

00:21:58.526 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And we have another chart
of my working relationship

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
with my executive producer
Tom Danheiser and me.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.125 align:middle line:90%
Now what does this mean?

00:22:11.125 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: So what I
did, I took Tom's chart,

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:10%
and then I crossed it
with yours to see, well,

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:10%
what's the synastry?

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:10%
Because that's the synastry.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:10%
What's going on there?

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.239 align:middle line:10%
And also it's a good example.

00:22:22.239 --> 00:22:24.279 align:middle line:10%
Just looking at Tom's
chart-- I will have to say,

00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:10%
I don't have his ascendant.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:10%
So I'm working
with a solar chart.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:84%
That is when we take the sun
and we make that the ascendant.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:90%
But it's still very accurate.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Now Tom's chart's
a good example why

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.400 align:middle line:84%
we are so much more
than just our sun sign.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:90%
He's Pisces.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, he's
March 16, I think.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:90%
And so he's got a Pisces sun.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:53.830 align:middle line:84%
However, he has Jupiter
right on top of that sun.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:10%
Jupiter expands
anything it touches.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:10%
Jupiter rules Sagittarius.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:10%
So that means because Pisces
can be very-- Pisces retreat.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Pisces can be very receptive.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:84%
If you have a lot of
Pisces or Neptune,

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.410 align:middle line:90%
you can be super sensitive.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not the most active energy.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when
I first met Tom.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.501 align:middle line:84%
He's so charismatic,
so articulate.

00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:16.626 align:middle line:84%
And when he said he was a
Pisces, I was like, well,

00:23:16.626 --> 00:23:17.725 align:middle line:84%
I got to see this chart
because there's going

00:23:17.725 --> 00:23:19.280 align:middle line:90%
to be a lot more going on.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't have that
charisma with just Pisces.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's Jupiter bringing
Sagittarius energy.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's great
when in your chart,

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius is the
opposite of Gemini.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:90%
It's the ideal complement.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Sag is fiery.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Gemini is air.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Think about how air fuels fire.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So we love to put air
and fire together.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So even though because
Pisces and Gemini

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:90%
aren't the greatest mix.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But that's why you really need
to see what else is going on.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should
I get rid of him?

00:23:51.035 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE (laughing): No.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.820 align:middle line:84%
That would not be
a smart decision.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would be a bad
business move on my part.

00:23:57.405 --> 00:23:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: That would be.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that that would be.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, well.

00:24:03.365 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: There are a lot of
wonderful, dynamic oppositions.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Some astrologers, they
really like conjunctions.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
They want your Gemini sun
to go with his Gemini moon.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I frankly find that
a little boring.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be with
someone who's just like me.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So I find in the
most successful,

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.600 align:middle line:84%
dynamic relationships,
you want somebody

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.540 align:middle line:84%
bringing something else to
the table that complements.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So not only he's bringing-- his
moon is even in Sagittarius.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And that complements
your Gemini.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
But then you've got
this earthy Taurus,

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and that does complement
the watery Pisces.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And then he's got
some Aquarian energy.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:43.900 align:middle line:90%
You have Aquarian energy.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So you do have some
real combinations,

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.960 align:middle line:90%
and some real similarities.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And one really
interesting-- Mars.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Mars can make things
really exciting.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Now Mars can make
things combative.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.680 align:middle line:84%
But as long as you are open
to intellectual debate--

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.780 align:middle line:84%
as I know Geminis are-- then I
think it's a fantastic aspect.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Because your Mars
lights up his chart.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:90%
His Mars lights up your chart.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:12.470 align:middle line:84%
This is a dynamic relationship,
a lot of intellectual debate.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can challenge each
other in very positive ways.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to
look at two people who

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:84%
did not get along, and then
looked at their charts,

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.130 align:middle line:90%
would they show that to you?

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, absolutely.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Now you can have an
aspect-- someone's Mars

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:90%
can oppose someone's sun.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Now that's going to be
difficult for some people,

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.900 align:middle line:90%
inspiring for others.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.230 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on what that
natal chart can handle.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.672 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- they really
can't handle too much conflict.

00:25:42.672 --> 00:25:45.130 align:middle line:84%
They need to have people just
agree with them all the time.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be a
more difficult aspect.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
I always do is

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.360 align:middle line:84%
look at the natal
charts of the couple,

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:90%
and then I look at the aspects.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Because that will tell me
how they will interpret them.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.150 align:middle line:84%
But with awareness, we
can always-- I mean,

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:90%
challenges are just challenges.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.022 align:middle line:84%
We can always overcome
them with effort.

00:26:03.022 --> 00:26:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Using this
in your everyday life,

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:90%
do you use it as a guidepost?

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.427 align:middle line:84%
How do people implement
what you've just told me?

00:26:11.427 --> 00:26:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can incorporate
it right away.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Especially if I'm with
a couple, I can then

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.640 align:middle line:90%
encourage certain activities.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:84%
There was one couple
that I just spoke to.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
They were fighting
like cats and dogs.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.660 align:middle line:84%
They had Mars was
very activated.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
When they had first
got together-- now

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.032 align:middle line:84%
in a romantic relationship,
it's great sex.

00:26:31.032 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So when they first
got together, it

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.680 align:middle line:90%
was this passionate, wild sex.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.550 align:middle line:90%
And it was great.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And then after 10
years, they just

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.920 align:middle line:90%
started fighting all the time.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
saying, well, you

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:84%
need healthy outlets
for your Mars energy.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:90%
Go hiking together.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Go rock climbing.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Play competitive sports.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But why together?

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.900 align:middle line:90%
Why not separately?

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, because
this is the synastry.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:90%
It's in their synastry.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not in their natal chart.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:90%
This is as a couple.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.689 align:middle line:90%
How can they become closer?

00:26:57.689 --> 00:26:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.329 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes as a
couple, you're closer

00:27:00.329 --> 00:27:01.370 align:middle line:90%
when you're not together.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And
that will show up.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Certain people really
want a lot of freedom.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.400 align:middle line:84%
If you have Aquarius
in your chart,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:90%
you can want a lot of freedom.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Geminis aren't the most--
they can be a little detached.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:84%
But then Taurus-- you have
a lot of different energy

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:84%
in the chart, which
is interesting.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.382 align:middle line:84%
When you can integrate a
lot of different signs,

00:27:22.382 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:84%
that's when we
become very complex.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm pretty flexible,
but I also change a lot.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, I like a lot
of different things

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:90%
at any different time.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And that's
classic Gemini.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.235 align:middle line:90%
Geminis are curious.

00:27:32.235 --> 00:27:35.197 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.197 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:84%
We can get bored--
because I'm a Gemini too.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
We get bored if it's just
the same environment,

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.815 align:middle line:90%
the same thing over and over.

00:27:41.815 --> 00:27:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're also
a little compulsive

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:45.255 align:middle line:90%
about certain things.

00:27:45.255 --> 00:27:46.239 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh!

00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you see that?

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, but that's
more because of your Pluto

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:90%
on your ascendant.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Pluto rules obsession
and that kind of energy.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And Pluto can really get you
very excited and passionate

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:90%
on a topic.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.224 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, like I
have a light bulb fetish.

00:28:05.224 --> 00:28:06.140 align:middle line:90%
You know what that is?

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.040 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Guess-- what do
you think that is?

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE (laughing):
You like light bulbs.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I like to replace
burned out light bulbs.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: OK, that's
actually in your Virgo.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I find it to
be a lack of something

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.770 align:middle line:90%
if it's burned out.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.790 align:middle line:84%
If I see a burned-out light bulb
at a restaurant or a sign going

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:84%
into a place, to me,
that's carelessness.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: Well, now
I would attribute that

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.130 align:middle line:10%
to your Mars in Virgo.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:39.946 align:middle line:10%
Because Virgo is very-- they
want everything in place,

00:28:39.946 --> 00:28:40.820 align:middle line:10%
and they're detailed.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.859 align:middle line:10%
And that would
definitely bother a Virgo

00:28:42.859 --> 00:28:45.400 align:middle line:10%
to have something burned out,
and you would want to put that.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.520 align:middle line:10%
And then you have energy to do
that because that's your Mars.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nothing
wrong with that--

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Absolutely
nothing wrong with that--

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Heather, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Thank you so much.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:55.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I appreciate it.

00:28:55.155 --> 00:28:56.071 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating astrology.

00:28:56.071 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:10%
I mean, who would wonder
that the stars could

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:10%
determine who you are?

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.280 align:middle line:10%
Heather Arielle-- she knows.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.960 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:23.648 align:middle line:90%
