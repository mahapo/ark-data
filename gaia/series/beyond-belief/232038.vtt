00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY CHURCH: Hey,
everyone, I'm Jimmy Church.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:10%
You've probably seen me right
here on Into The Vortex on Gaia.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:10%
And I'm honored to be sitting in
for George Noory on this episode

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:10%
of Beyond Belief.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Joining us is award-winning
filmmaker and journalist,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Brian Cory Dobbs.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:84%
He is here to tell us
that not only was there

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
life on Mars thousands
of years ago,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:84%
but there is still
life on Mars today.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Brian.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIAN DOBBS: Thank you
Jimmy, it's great to be here.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.195 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Let's start
with the big stuff.

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:90%
It's the face on Mars.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the newspapers
and the coverage on it,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:90%
we were all fascinated with it.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:90%
That's where it started for me.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:10%
Did it start that way with you?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: It did, and
that's a common story.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:10%
I remember being in
college 20 years ago

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:10%
and found this face
on Mars picture

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:10%
on some internet
message board one time,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:10%
and it looked haunting for sure.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And then people just
explain it away and then

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:84%
that's that and you don't really
hear about Mars other than that.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Where were you
with it today, the face?

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: With the
face, jeez, the face

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.755 align:middle line:84%
is the most controversial
aspect of Mars,

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:84%
aside from the question
of life itself.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:10%
What most people don't
know about the face

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:10%
and about the structure
that just so happens

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:10%
to look like a face, is that
there is quantitative analysis

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:10%
done by Dr. Mark Carlotto that
indicates this feature has

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:10%
an inherent sense of geometry,
repeated expressions of 3,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.760 align:middle line:10%
4, or 5 triangles and symmetry.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And when run through
computer software,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
fractal analysis
indicates that it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:84%
is distinctly different than
the surrounding landscape.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:84%
So quantitatively speaking,
it's a unique feature.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.035 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Do you think the face
was done for us to observe,

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:22.035 align:middle line:84%
or do you think it was more
of a monument or a temple?

00:02:22.035 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DOBBS: Who's to say?

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once we start trying
to attribute significance

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:84%
beyond just how unusual it
looks like from a mathematical

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:84%
standpoint, that's where you
start getting into too much

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:90%
speculative territory.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:10%
What is interesting,
though, is that it's

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:10%
in a region on Mars
that just so happens

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:10%
to be near other unusual
formations on there.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:10%
And I guess the question
is whether or not

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:10%
it's actually intended to be
a face and beacon for those

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:10%
who might be looking
at it from above.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:10%
It's awfully strange.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:10%
And why not go take
a closer look at it?

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.285 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: Well, what
are we doing here?

00:03:07.285 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
We have things all over
this planet that can only

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:90%
be observed from above.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So why wouldn't an ancient
culture do the exact same thing?

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:90%
That's our evidence.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:90%
It's evidence of one.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.585 align:middle line:84%
We do it, so why
wouldn't somebody else?

00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: Well, and
that's the argument.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
There's precedent
for that thing.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So people who want to claim that
the idea that it was created

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.930 align:middle line:84%
for someone else to look at
from a different perspective,

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.396 align:middle line:84%
for that to be nonsense,
well, I don't buy that.

00:03:38.396 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And while the face
gets all the attention

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:84%
for those people who are
uninitiated to the entire--

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.905 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: As it should.

00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: It's a
compelling feature.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly made
NASA go, hey look,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
there's something
strange here back in 1976

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:90%
when they first imaged it.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now with the evidence
as we look at Mars, photograph

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Mars, image Mars, the
topography, the geography,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:84%
it appears that
water was everywhere.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But that's the was
and that's the past.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Is there evidence
of water today?

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Is it still everywhere?

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DOBBS: Yes, it is.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.240 align:middle line:10%
And most notably at
the polar ice cap,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.685 align:middle line:10%
that is in fact water ice.

00:04:24.685 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:90%
We know this.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:84%
This is beyond just
evidence, this is proof.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:90%
We've proven that this is ice.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Now basically all
over the planet,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.535 align:middle line:84%
just centimeters beneath
the surface of the soil,

00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is frozen water,
ice essentially.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:90%
So it's everywhere today.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Why keep the public
in the dark about this?

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.175 align:middle line:84%
The public seems to be generally
unaware of a ginormous fact.

00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: That's a
very good question.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
What I would
attribute that to is

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:84%
just the lackluster
public relations

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.205 align:middle line:84%
that NASA has offered for
the past nearly half century.

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
The previous
versions of NASA were

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.610 align:middle line:84%
really gung-ho about going out
and conquering space and just

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
making these discoveries and
talking about the significance

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:90%
of their work with the public.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.770 align:middle line:84%
But lately the past few
decades, that really

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been the case.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's just one
of the common themes

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.675 align:middle line:84%
with NASA is that they make
incredible discoveries, they do.

00:05:27.675 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:84%
They're messaging on what
they've discovered, stinks.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: When you look
at, again, the topography

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:10%
and you look at the
imaging, you can see where

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.725 align:middle line:10%
an ocean should have been.

00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:10%
Was Mars just a
water world like us?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:10%
And isn't water life?

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: I mean, look
at what NASA says.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:10%
In their search for
life, what do they say?

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.050 align:middle line:10%
Follow the water.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:10%
So when we look at Mars
today, for those people who

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:10%
have seen an image of the Earth
with all the water sucked out

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:10%
of it, you see these
differences in elevations

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.595 align:middle line:10%
and we see the same on Mars.

00:06:05.595 --> 00:06:07.470 align:middle line:10%
It just so happens to
be a lot of the land is

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.178 align:middle line:10%
on one side of the planet, and a
lot of the lower elevation where

00:06:10.178 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:10%
an ocean used to be.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.620 align:middle line:10%
So the topography
looks different,

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.030 align:middle line:10%
but there is erosional
evidence of what

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:10%
appeared to be former rivers,
lakes, and of course, an ocean.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So it really all
points to this notion

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that Mars used to look a
lot like Earth does today.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.055 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: And we can see that?

00:06:35.055 --> 00:06:36.725 align:middle line:90%
We can see it.

00:06:36.725 --> 00:06:42.150 align:middle line:84%
What else could create
that waterway or the path

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:90%
of a river and that erosion?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.338 align:middle line:84%
What else could do
that besides water?

00:06:47.338 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: That's a
very good question.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.338 align:middle line:84%
It seems so obvious,
even to people

00:06:50.338 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:84%
who aren't trained in
geology or water erosion.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And thank goodness for people
like Dr. John Brandenburg, who

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.670 align:middle line:84%
back in 1986 was
the first to publish

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:84%
this whole hypothesis
about there

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:90%
being a previous ocean on Mars.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Now back then, the scientific
community more or less

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
rejected this idea, but
today it's widely accepted.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, if water is
life, and that's what NASA says,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:84%
that's what anthropologists
say, and we're out there looking

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
for life now, look
for water worlds,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.640 align:middle line:84%
water is life, that
would indicate there

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:90%
must be microbial fossils.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.300 align:middle line:84%
There must be
microbial evidence.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.317 align:middle line:90%
But NASA denies this, why?

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: It's a whole
can of worms they just

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:90%
don't want to address.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:84%
As we know here
on Earth, microbes

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:84%
can essentially live
everywhere in the most extreme

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:90%
environments.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Even in the middle of an ice
block of a piece of an ice--

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And some microbes can actually
melt the surrounding ice,

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
creating a little sea for them
to swim around in and extract

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:90%
nutrients.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have ice on Mars,
and the conditions

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.290 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of Mars
aren't nearly as harsh

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:84%
as some of the
conditions on Earth,

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.137 align:middle line:84%
hydrothermal vents
inside nuclear waste.

00:08:06.137 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
On the outside of the
International Space Station,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:90%
we're finding microbes.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Certainly the surface of Mars
is more hospitable to microbes,

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:90%
so why not?

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Why is that such a bold claim
that the possibility of finding

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.920 align:middle line:84%
microbes on the surface of
Mars within the ice that's

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet, and you've
got the sun providing energy,

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.170 align:middle line:84%
you've got some organic matter
there, some energy source,

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.940 align:middle line:90%
so why is that so crazy?

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.395 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: You mentioned
Viking earlier.

00:08:33.395 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:84%
The original announcements
from Viking were,

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.620 align:middle line:90%
wow, we've got life on Mars.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And I always imagined the
experiments with the droppers

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.690 align:middle line:84%
and how they were doing that,
and they came back with life

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:90%
on Mars.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the opposite of
NASA's current statements.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: The Devil's
in the details.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:00.015 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
public relations mishaps

00:09:00.015 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:90%
that I just mentioned.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:84%
In 1976, we send this
really ambitious mission

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
to Mars, two probes, both
with a lander and an orbiter.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
The landers go down, each lander
on opposite side of the planet

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:84%
was equipped with life
detection experiments.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:90%
These are biology experiments.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of them in particular,
known as the Labeled Release

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.940 align:middle line:84%
experiment designed by
the late Dr. Gil Levin.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:90%
It simply worked like this.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:84%
You'd scoop up some soil,
feed it some nutrients,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.252 align:middle line:90%
and see if any gas came down.

00:09:36.252 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:84%
This was tested over
4,000 times here on Earth.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Never produced a false
positive nor false negative.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know about
you, but in my book

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:90%
that's a perfect test.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: That's pretty solid.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: And NASA wants to send
stuff out into space that they

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:90%
know is going to work.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.550 align:middle line:90%
So they send it to Mars.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And it did exactly
what was intended,

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:84%
to find soil that feed nutrients
to it and produce some gas.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Now the question was,
well, why didn't they

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:84%
just pop the champagne and
say, we found life on Mars?

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.680 align:middle line:84%
The problem was there
was another test,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
a non-biological
test that was just

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:84%
testing for organic
matter in the soil,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.616 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't find it.

00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:15.945 align:middle line:84%
Now we find out
later that the reason

00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:84%
why they didn't find
the organic matter

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.733 align:middle line:84%
is because the experiment wasn't
sensitive enough back in 1976.

00:10:21.733 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And what makes it even worse
is that they knew that.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Because they sent
this particular test,

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:84%
the gas chromatograph
mass spectrometer,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
to Antarctica to
test it there to see

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
if it found any organic matter
in the soil of Antarctica.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't find any, but they
still sent it to Mars anyway.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And they let that
override the test results

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:84%
came back from the Labeled
Release experiment.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Fast-forward decades
later, we start

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
sending these cute little
rovers, which do fantastic work,

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:90%
take fantastic images.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.360 align:middle line:84%
They found the missing
organic matter.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:84%
So why haven't we
revisited this question,

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:90%
NASA, nearly 50 years later?

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: It seems to me,
and I could be way off here,

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:84%
but finding any
indication of life on Mars

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
would increase the
funding environment.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.240 align:middle line:84%
That suddenly things
would go their way.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.833 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't they pursue it?

00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: Well, we have
precedent for that too.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we fast-forward a
little bit to the Allan Hills

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:84%
meteorite story of
1996, where Bill Clinton

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.600 align:middle line:84%
talked about this in the
White House lawn, that

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:90%
directly funded NASA even more.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.600 align:middle line:84%
They started new astrobiology
research departments

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
in the wake of that
whole discovery.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was the second public
relations mishap for them

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:84%
because there's been
a lot of controversy.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Is it or is it not life
embedded in this one

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:90%
particular meteorite?

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
it became, oh, well, we

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:84%
don't want to touch
that because we're not

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:84%
even sure we might have made
a claim that isn't true.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:84%
They simply don't want
to make another mistake.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So what they do instead
is just publish the data.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't really offer
any commentary on that.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:84%
They will leave that
to other people,

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.620 align:middle line:84%
the independent
researchers essentially.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Right now
with the James Webb

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Space Telescope in
looking at exoplanets

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to
peer into an atmosphere

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:84%
is pretty amazing to do
that light years away,

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:84%
but are looking for certain
things that can only

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.915 align:middle line:90%
be produced by microbial life.

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And we've had some pretty
exciting announcements of late.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:84%
What can be produced
by microbial life?

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: Well, James
Webb Telescope,

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.645 align:middle line:84%
that's a great
example here of what--

00:12:40.645 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
NASA does amazing
feats of engineering.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.148 align:middle line:84%
We stick this fancy telescope,
the successor to the Hubble

00:12:45.148 --> 00:12:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Telescope, out in
outer space, and it

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.490 align:middle line:84%
looks at these exoplanets
many light years away.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking
at the habitability

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
of these atmospheres of
these Earth-like planets.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And they say, we
see biosignatures

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:90%
in their atmosphere.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, what are they looking for?

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for this one
particular organic substance.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's a mouthful, it's
known as dimethyl sulfide.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what leads
these news stories,

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:84%
scientists think they
found life on exoplanets.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for this one
particular organic substance

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:90%
known as dimethyl sulfide.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Now what I find even
more interesting

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:84%
or where I think that people are
missing the obvious point here

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:84%
is that where else do we
find dimethyl sulfide?

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Which by the way to answer
your question, what produces

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:90%
dimethyl sulfide is microbes.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can
produce dimethyl sulfide

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
is through active
microbial activity.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.210 align:middle line:90%
NASA knows this.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
They even have this
on their website.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:45.260 align:middle line:84%
We find dimethyl
sulfide on Mars.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:84%
What discovered dimethyl
sulfide on Mars?

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Was the Curiosity rover.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:84%
When it found the
organic matter,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:84%
it found the dimethyl
sulfide on Mars.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So why are we not taking
a closer look at this?

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: It doesn't
make any sense, does it?

00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DOBBS: No.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When we have huge
press releases coming out

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.690 align:middle line:84%
from the James Webb
Space Telescope,

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:84%
life on another planet,
alien life discovered.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Here we go, we've
got a water world.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that can produce
this out of water on Earth

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.660 align:middle line:90%
is this, and now we have it.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:84%
If the same thing is
happening with the planet that

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
is next to us, that should
be the biggest news ever.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.650 align:middle line:90%
And that is the question, why?

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Why stop it?

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: I've
interviewed a gentleman

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Dr. Steven Benner,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:84%
an award-winning
biochemist who has a lot

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:84%
to say on the direction of
the overall astrobiology

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.920 align:middle line:84%
community, who's got
a focus on exoplanets,

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.040 align:middle line:84%
or maybe the moons of
Saturn and Jupiter.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Benner says it's
ridiculous to put our efforts

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.545 align:middle line:84%
into these places that we're not
going to get to in our lifetime.

00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Mars is right next door.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.630 align:middle line:84%
It's got all this evidence
for microbial life,

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:90%
and we can get there.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:90%
We can get there next decade.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:90%
So why are we not going there?

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:84%
There's this stigma
attached to Mars.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of baggage
associated with Mars.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.410 align:middle line:84%
We've had 50 years of false
starts from the public's

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:18.915 align:middle line:84%
perspective that those in
charge of the administration

00:15:18.915 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:84%
simply don't want to
step in something that's

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:90%
going to tarnish their career.

it is on planet Earth,
and how easy it is to see.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:90%
making these discoveries.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.213 align:middle line:84%
They just don't like
to talk about it.

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
But Dr. Carol Stoker, who is
still employed at NASA today,

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:84%
she through the use
of spectroscopy,

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and for those who don't
know that's when you shine

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.872 align:middle line:84%
a laser at something and see
what wavelengths come back

00:16:00.872 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and it indicates what
material it's made out of,

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and this is a common way of
trying to figure out what

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:84%
stuff's made out of, it's
well-accepted in the scientific

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.500 align:middle line:84%
community, through the
use of spectroscopy, yes,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
discovered something that
looks like chlorophyll.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, she was only allowed to
publish an abstract on this, not

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.042 align:middle line:90%
a full research paper.

00:16:22.042 --> 00:16:22.842 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:22.842 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Why are we not
following up on that?

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.090 align:middle line:90%
This is a NASA scientist.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: What is rock varnish?

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: That's
a great question.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Here on Earth in the deserts,
certain types of rocks

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.890 align:middle line:84%
have this black, shiny coating,
a varnish-looking coating.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
You might call it rock
varnish or desert varnish.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And this shiny
black coating that

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
was created over
centuries of time

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:84%
was created by a
microbial process.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Them interacting with
manganese, maybe digesting it,

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:01.616 align:middle line:84%
producing this thin film
that hardens over the rock.

00:17:01.616 --> 00:17:06.699 align:middle line:90%
And we see this in the desert.

00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to the rovers
that NASA has sent to Mars

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and has taken many
photographs of Mars,

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:84%
we see this in the photos that
depict rock varnish on Mars.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.589 align:middle line:84%
So when the claim is
made there's absolutely

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.630 align:middle line:84%
no evidence of life on Mars,
that's simply not true.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
But let's take a look
at the word evidence.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:84%
When I use the word
evidence, I use it

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:90%
in the strictest legal sense.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Evidence does not mean
the same thing as proof.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Evidence means suggestive of
proof, means conclusive of.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.990 align:middle line:90%
People conflate the terms.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So when people say
there's no evidence,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, that's not true.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And in my messaging I
don't say that there

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:90%
is proof of life on Mars.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying there is
strong evidence that

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.480 align:middle line:84%
needs to be followed up
on by biology experiments.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we haven't
sent a biology experiment

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.770 align:middle line:84%
to Mars in almost 50
years, what's that about?

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Doesn't
make any sense.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why
we don't send rovers

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:90%
to where the issues are.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we sending rovers in
the middle of a pile of snow?

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying, that seems
like the right thing to do.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Why haven't we gone back
to the face on Mars?

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.875 align:middle line:84%
Why haven't we gone to the
shorelines of these oceans

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:32.630 align:middle line:90%
and look for fossils?

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:90%
I want to see a seashell.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, go to where they may be.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason,
we just don't do that.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: NASA will actually
address this partially.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.025 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, we don't want to
go to these, quote-unquote,

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:84%
"special regions" where
they think there's a higher

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
probability of finding life
because they don't want

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:90%
to contaminate those locations.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Seems noble, but if
their whole mission

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:84%
is to search for life,
not whole mission,

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.360 align:middle line:84%
but a large portion of their
mission is to search for life,

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
then they're not
doing a good job of it

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:90%
because they're avoiding it.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
They haven't sent
biology experiments.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:84%
They're only sending rovers
that are equipped with geology

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:90%
and atmospheric experiments.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.117 align:middle line:84%
They're not looking
directly for life.

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:84%
What they say they're
doing is looking

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:90%
for signs of ancient life.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Arguably, they've already
taken photographs of that,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk
about that later.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.205 align:middle line:84%
But as to why they're not
looking for it directly,

00:19:31.205 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:84%
it's just getting
absurd at this point.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I like the
helicopter, but we

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.940 align:middle line:90%
didn't put a camera on it.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:84%
We have some images
of rock varnish.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at this and
tell us what we're looking at.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: So here's my
friend Barry DiGregorio.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:10%
He's an astrobiologist,
and he's literally

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.200 align:middle line:10%
written the book about
the whole Viking mission.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:10%
Pretty much it's a
biography on Gil Levin,

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:10%
but he has pointed me in the
direction of rock varnish

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:10%
on Earth.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:10%
So here you can see
what it looks like.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:10%
You can take something and
scrape off that black coating.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:10%
And that is what rock varnish
looks like here on Earth.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:10%
So when we take a look
at Mars, arguably we

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.490 align:middle line:10%
see this coating on
these rocks on Mars.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.645 align:middle line:10%
Now Barry is not the only
one who's noticed this.

00:20:22.645 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:10%


00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.860 align:middle line:10%
Scientists who are affiliated
with NASA, specifically

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:10%
Nina Lanza at Los Alamos has
published papers on this.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:10%
And what they're
trying to do, Jimmy,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:10%
is find some mechanism that
creates rock varnish on Mars

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:10%
without invoking life.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And to date, they cannot
find that mechanism.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.510 align:middle line:84%
It is a yet
undetermined mechanism

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.610 align:middle line:84%
that is producing
rock varnish on Mars.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.702 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So what else
could cause rock varnish?

00:20:51.702 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DOBBS: That's the question.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
They can't come
up with anything.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What about
fossil evidence,

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.390 align:middle line:84%
have they photographed
any of that?

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DOBBS: Arguably, yes.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best
examples of this

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:84%
was, and let's talk
about evidence again.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Photographs are evidence
submissible in a court of law.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So when a rover takes a
photograph of something that

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.890 align:middle line:84%
looks funny and you take
a closer look at it,

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:84%
maybe a paleontologist
might look at it

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.903 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey you know what,
that looks like a fossil?

00:21:27.903 --> 00:21:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it turns
out there we do

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:35.020 align:middle line:84%
in fact have a few photographs
sourced from NASA rover images

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that do indicate something
that appears to be a fossil.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
The most notable one
was taken in 2004,

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:84%
the Opportunity Rover
took something that

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:90%
appears to be a crinoid fossil.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: We have an image here.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:10%
Tell us what we're looking at?

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: So you
can see a crinoid.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:10%
It's a sea creature.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:10%
It's an animal.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:10%
And on the left you'll see
a fossil version of that--

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: From Earth?

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.220 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: Yes, this is on Earth.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:10%
And it's known as
a stalked crinoid.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:10%
And it has a little trunk that
tethers itself or roots itself

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.432 align:middle line:10%
in the seabed.

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:10%
But this is an animal,
and that trunk,

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:10%
it comes out of the sea
floor and bifurcates,

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.750 align:middle line:10%
it splits and then it keeps
splitting, keeps splitting.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But that bifurcation is
a signature of crinoids.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:10%
So if we just take a
look at the stalk here,

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:10%
here are two examples of just
the stalk and just the hint

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.960 align:middle line:10%
of a bifurcation.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.770 align:middle line:10%


00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.230 align:middle line:10%
Well, we have two images here.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.660 align:middle line:10%
One is from Earth
and one is from Mars.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:10%
Now, Jimmy, if you were to try
to guess which one is which,

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.560 align:middle line:10%
what would you say?

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: Both are amazing.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.840 align:middle line:10%
And if I get it wrong, that's
going to be more amazing.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:10%
Now, I would say that the one
on the right is from Earth.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.660 align:middle line:10%
The image on the left
from Mars, how could that

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:10%
happen naturally on Mars
with the planet without life?

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: So when I first
came across this image,

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, I don't know what a
crinoid is, so I looked that up.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:10%
And then I'm like, well, I
need to vet this somehow.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So I said, let me see if I
can find a paleontologist

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:90%
and ask him what he thought.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And I emailed this photo
to a paleontologist

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.900 align:middle line:84%
who specializes
in crinoid fossils

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Cincinnati.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, what
do you think of this?

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And he says, this looks like
the fossil of either a sea

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:90%
lily or a crinoid.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.912 align:middle line:84%
Then he asked me
where I got the image.

00:23:44.912 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And I told him it
came from NASA,

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.927 align:middle line:90%
it was photographed on Mars.

00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: What was his reaction?

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: I never
heard back from him.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Of course not.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: But that let me know
that a trained eye, someone

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
who specializes in
this stuff, even thinks

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:90%
that that's a crinoid fossil.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It's good enough for me, why
are we not following up on that?

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.165 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: What part of
Mars was that photographed?

00:24:06.165 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: I don't know.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:11.590 align:middle line:10%
And unfortunately, we
can't go back to it

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:10%
because NASA in an effort
to investigate further,

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:10%
ground it down to nothing.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.010 align:middle line:10%
Three hours later after
that photo was taken,

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:29.200 align:middle line:10%
they used a rock abrasion
tool to dig into it

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:10%
to see if it contained any
carbon, which is an absolutely

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:33.770 align:middle line:10%
ridiculous thing to do.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.720 align:middle line:10%
When you come across
a dinosaur skull,

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:10%
you don't crack it
open with a hammer

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:10%
to see if there's
any brains inside.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.030 align:middle line:10%
It's all fossilized.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:10%
There is no more
carbon in fossils.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Why did they grind it down?

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.478 align:middle line:84%
It just seems like the
most idiotic thing to do.

00:24:50.478 --> 00:24:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: We're going to be
looking at some more images

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:53.570 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But as a filmmaker and
I live in Hollywood,

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:84%
I love the art of filmmaking,
I love the wider the screen

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:10.350 align:middle line:84%
the better, and the more color
the better, but in editing

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and everything else, but I do
look at film and I study it,

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.150 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:84%
When I look at the
millions of images of Mars,

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and today they're more higher
def than ever before, you

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:84%
can really break this
down and look at it,

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.200 align:middle line:84%
but as somebody that's
looking at an image,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.900 align:middle line:84%
if I was out in the desert
and I needed to survive,

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to scan and look for
something I need to walk to.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I need something
that isn't natural.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I need a structure,
I need something.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
You see that all through the
images of Mars, don't you?

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
You can look off in
the distance and see

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:90%
something that isn't natural.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It's all over the place
on Mars, isn't it?

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: Yes.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:01.910 align:middle line:10%
And thank God we have
these folks scattered

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.590 align:middle line:10%
throughout the world, these
independent Mars researchers who

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:11.910 align:middle line:10%
are just your average Joe, doing
nothing else in their spare time

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:16.820 align:middle line:10%
but to sift through upon
thousands of images,

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.250 align:middle line:10%
excuse me, finding quite
a number of anomalies.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What is
a trace fossil?

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.547 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: A trace fossil,
think of it this way.

00:26:23.547 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Think of a dinosaur footprint.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not the dinosaur
skeleton itself,

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:33.545 align:middle line:84%
but you know that 65 million
years ago a big old animal

00:26:33.545 --> 00:26:36.290 align:middle line:84%
stood right there and
made that footprint.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting
is that, again,

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:84%
getting back to
photographic evidence,

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:47.420 align:middle line:84%
we do have photographic evidence
of trace fossils on Mars.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Not dinosaur
footprints, but Jimmy,

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:55.340 align:middle line:84%
imagine what a worm
footprint might look like.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:90%
What do worms do?

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.620 align:middle line:84%
They just sliver
through the soil.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:04.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to dig
up that piece of soil

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and open it up and look inside,
you'd see these little burrows.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Little critters make
these little tracks,

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.330 align:middle line:84%
these what they call
worm-like trace fossils.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And we do in fact see
trace fossils, thanks

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:23.050 align:middle line:84%
to the work of Barry
DiGregorio, he's

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.400 align:middle line:84%
an astrobiologist,
Gil Evans biographer,

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.210 align:middle line:84%
but he also sifts through
thousands of these images

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.800 align:middle line:90%
just looking for anomalies.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And he has uncovered
images of what

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:39.320 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be trace fossils in
what was once a lake on Mars.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:90%
So is it any--

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.768 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: We have
some images here.

00:27:41.768 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Take me through this.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.515 align:middle line:90%


00:27:45.515 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: Well, here you go.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.200 align:middle line:10%
Here's another comparison.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:10%
What we see here are two
images, one is on Earth

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.130 align:middle line:10%
and one is on Mars.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.460 align:middle line:10%
Jimmy, we just see these
little squiggly lines.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:59.220 align:middle line:10%
If you had to take a guess,
which would you say is Earth

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:10%
and which would you say is Mars?

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.910 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: They're
both from my backyard.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:08.600 align:middle line:10%
I think they both show organic
life, that's what I see.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.470 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: Well, when
they talk about rovers

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:10%
looking for signs of ancient
life, what is ancient life?

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:10%
As we can see here, the
one on the left is Mars.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: Oh.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.075 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: The one on
the right is Earth.

00:28:20.075 --> 00:28:22.660 align:middle line:10%
So we see these
squiggly lines, which

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:10%
is distinctly different from
the surrounding rock there.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:10%
Is this not exactly
what NASA is claiming

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:32.150 align:middle line:10%
that they're looking for right
now, signs of ancient life?

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.110 align:middle line:10%
What is ancient life?

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.730 align:middle line:10%
Most likely fossilized.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.230 align:middle line:10%
There you go, boys.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:37.600 align:middle line:10%
It's right there.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:10%
So here's another
example, again, my friend

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.675 align:middle line:10%
Barry DiGregorio.

00:28:41.675 --> 00:28:44.143 align:middle line:10%
We see these rocks
with these holes.

00:28:44.143 --> 00:28:45.310 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: That's incredible.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: This is a marine rock.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.910 align:middle line:10%
It was at the bottom of a
lake or maybe even an ocean.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:10%
And there are creatures
who bore into rocks

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.545 align:middle line:10%
and make these
signature holes here.

00:28:55.545 --> 00:28:58.150 align:middle line:10%
Here on Earth we see it
and here we see it on Mars.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:10%
So is that not signs
of ancient life?

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: It's the
same image, isn't it?

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.155 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.155 --> 00:29:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: Are we
kidding ourselves here?

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.572 align:middle line:84%
Or it's just like,
don't believe your eyes?

00:29:09.572 --> 00:29:13.890 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Panspermia is one
of my favorite subjects.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm going to look
at an obvious situation

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:84%
for panspermia, I
look at the asteroid

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Bennu and what just
happened there.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And to have the
technology for us

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:84%
to go out, land
on that asteroid,

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:38.585 align:middle line:84%
scoop it up, bring it back,
crashed in the Utah desert

00:29:38.585 --> 00:29:40.710 align:middle line:84%
a couple of years ago, and
did the testing of that.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:41.970 align:middle line:90%
And what did we find?

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
We found the 20 amino
acids that make up

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:50.370 align:middle line:84%
RNA in the vacuum of space
on a random asteroid.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:57.853 align:middle line:84%
We found the five proteins that
make up DNA from one soil scoop.

00:29:57.853 --> 00:30:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that asteroid crashed
into another planet with water

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.460 align:middle line:84%
a few million years
later, I think

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.760 align:middle line:84%
we would have
sophisticated life.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, panspermia answers
a lot of these questions.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Could it be the same
thing with Mars?

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And could these
meteorites crash on Mars,

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.740 align:middle line:84%
the same ones that crashed
here and brought life here?

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: Yes, it
turns out that there's

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.030 align:middle line:84%
evidence that says Earth
and Mars have essentially

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:30.030 align:middle line:84%
been swapping spit for millions,
if not billions of years.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:33.600 align:middle line:84%
We find Mars rocks come
to Earth all the time.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason why we should
expect Earth rocks aren't

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.530 align:middle line:90%
doing the same.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Getting back to the dinosaurs
65 million years ago,

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.620 align:middle line:84%
let's say a meteor comes
down and ejects material up

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.500 align:middle line:90%
into the atmosphere.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Some of it's going to come
back down, but some of it's

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.510 align:middle line:84%
going to be ejected so
far out and eventually

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.780 align:middle line:90%
make its way to Mars.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, inside this rock
will be a lot of microbes,

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and some of them will
survive that journey even

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.230 align:middle line:90%
through atmospheric reentry.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So this panspermia
concept is well-understood

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.030 align:middle line:90%
by astrobiologists today.

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:11.650 align:middle line:84%
They love talking
about it, but they

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:17.260 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to be familiar with
any of the evidence for it.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is surprising
to me, it is their field.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Like the Allan
Hills meteorite, for example?

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: Yes, this is the
most well-known example,

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:31.210 align:middle line:84%
a rock that was discovered in
the '80s, 1984 in Antarctica,

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.135 align:middle line:84%
took him 10 years
to do the analysis.

00:31:33.135 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately it found
its way to the White House,

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.633 align:middle line:84%
where Bill Clinton
himself had a--

00:31:37.633 --> 00:31:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Yes, he did.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: --press conference on
the White House lawn on this

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:47.596 align:middle line:84%
rock which appeared to show

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.630 align:middle line:10%
- More than four billion
years ago, this piece of rock

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.415 align:middle line:10%
was formed as a part of
the original crust of Mars.

00:32:04.415 --> 00:32:07.380 align:middle line:10%
After billions of years,
it broke from the surface

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.780 align:middle line:10%
and began a 16
million year journey

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.930 align:middle line:10%
through space that
would end here on Earth.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:10%
It arrived in a meteor
shower 13,000 years ago.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.700 align:middle line:10%
And in 1984, an
American scientist

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.530 align:middle line:10%
on an annual US
government mission

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.690 align:middle line:10%
to search for
meteors on Antarctica

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:27.600 align:middle line:10%
picked it up and took
it to be studied.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:10%
Appropriately, it
was the first rock

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:10%
to be picked up that
year, rock number 84001.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:42.710 align:middle line:10%
Today, rock 84001 speaks to
us across all those billions

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.940 align:middle line:10%
of years and millions of miles.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.485 align:middle line:10%
It speaks of the
possibility of life.

00:32:48.485 --> 00:32:51.170 align:middle line:10%
If this discovery
is confirmed, it

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.600 align:middle line:10%
will surely be one of the
most stunning insights

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.800 align:middle line:10%
into our universe that
science has ever uncovered.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.430 align:middle line:10%
Its implications are as
far-reaching and awe-inspiring

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:02.900 align:middle line:10%
as can be imagined.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.650 align:middle line:10%
Even as it promises answers to
some of our oldest questions,

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:10.260 align:middle line:10%
it poses still others
even more fundamental.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:10%
We will continue
to listen closely

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.490 align:middle line:10%
to what it has to say as we
continue the search for answers

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.520 align:middle line:10%
and for knowledge that
is as old as humanity

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.330 align:middle line:10%
itself, but essential
to our people's future.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Absolutely
fascinating.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know what my
takeaway from that

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:32.630 align:middle line:84%
is, the timescales that
we're talking about,

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:36.400 align:middle line:84%
4 billion years ago and
3 billion years ago.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And how long has
it taken us, you

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and I to sit here and
have this conversation?

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:46.250 align:middle line:84%
How many billions of
years have passed?

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:52.060 align:middle line:84%
That part is fine, but we
also can destroy ourselves

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.840 align:middle line:90%
in a nuclear war.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:34:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And in 1976, xenon-129, and
Brandenburg and my conversations

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:05.200 align:middle line:90%
with him about this discovery.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:10.328 align:middle line:90%
Xenon-129 only occurs when?

00:34:10.328 --> 00:34:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: That's a
very good question.

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So yes, in 1976, Viking mission
was observing the atmosphere

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.780 align:middle line:84%
of Mars, and it
started coming up

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.670 align:middle line:84%
with some really odd
mixtures of gases.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of these particular
isotopes that it found

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.400 align:middle line:84%
was an isotope of this often
misunderstood or really not

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.280 align:middle line:90%
well-known gas called xenon.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.194 align:middle line:90%
It sounds made up, but it's not.

00:34:35.194 --> 00:34:37.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's on the periodic table.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of its isotopes was
found in the atmosphere of Mars,

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:45.630 align:middle line:84%
which if you know what
you're looking at,

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:47.620 align:middle line:84%
you might scratch
your head over this.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting this
particular isotope, xenon-129,

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:84%
is that, well, as Dr.
Brandenburg, the person who

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.750 align:middle line:84%
was responsible for doing
all of this research

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and presenting all of
this data, actually, he's

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.455 align:middle line:84%
analyzing the data that
was collected by NASA.

00:35:06.455 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:84%
NASA collects all
this data, they

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:84%
don't necessarily analyze
and add any commentary to it.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But there's only
two ways you can

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.410 align:middle line:84%
create this particular
isotope of xenon.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:90%
One is through supernova.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Now let's just say
there was a supernova

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.800 align:middle line:90%
in the galactic neighborhood.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Hypothetically, if it didn't
blow up our solar system,

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.430 align:middle line:84%
it would have placed
xenon-129 everywhere else

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:29.290 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system,
but we don't see that.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:33.110 align:middle line:84%
We see a spike of
this only on Mars.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can rule out the
supernova explanation

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.310 align:middle line:90%
right then and there.

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:41.210 align:middle line:84%
You can also rule out any
other natural nuclear reactions

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:44.580 align:middle line:84%
because not all nuclear
reactions are created equal.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.140 align:middle line:90%
We won't go into the details.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And that leaves you with
only one alternative,

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:84%
which is that the xenon-129 that
we see in the atmosphere of Mars

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.220 align:middle line:90%
was not put there naturally.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.970 align:middle line:90%
It was an artificial process.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.870 align:middle line:84%
The only other process
that creates this

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:06.080 align:middle line:84%
is the physics that happens in
a thermonuclear weapon, which

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.540 align:middle line:84%
right then and there
stopped me in my tracks

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.010 align:middle line:90%
when I first heard about this.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Nuclear war, a nuclear
explosion, a nuclear bomb.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Would that suggest to you that
a civilization rose on Mars,

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:28.880 align:middle line:84%
advanced to having
nuclear technology

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.930 align:middle line:90%
and wiped themselves out?

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Or possibly that Mars
maybe was attacked

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.450 align:middle line:84%
by another extraterrestrial
race for whatever reason?

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:42.480 align:middle line:84%
We only have two
choices here, don't we?

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.605 align:middle line:90%
>>DOBBS: It's a good question.

00:36:44.605 --> 00:36:48.200 align:middle line:84%
What we can say is
that the location

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.260 align:middle line:84%
of the radioactive hotspots
on the surface of Mars

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.870 align:middle line:84%
indicate that there are
no craters just like--

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When you say hotspots,
are you saying locations on Mars

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:58.370 align:middle line:90%
where this was--

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: Think Chernobyl, you
go there it's radioactive.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.065 align:middle line:84%
You need a suit to go there,
that's a radioactive hotspot.

00:37:05.065 --> 00:37:08.340 align:middle line:84%
We see the same radioactive
hotspots on Mars.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And that was a nuclear
power plant meltdown.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But these particular
radioactive hotspots

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.002 align:middle line:90%
have different characteristics.

00:37:16.002 --> 00:37:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But there are no craters
in these locations,

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.550 align:middle line:84%
just like there are
no craters in Japan

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:90%
at Hiroshima or Nagasaki.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.500 align:middle line:84%
What happened there during
World War II were airbursts.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:33.430 align:middle line:84%
It's to maximize the radiation
fallout, the destruction.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So who can say as to who
might have done this?

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Did they do this to themselves?

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:42.305 align:middle line:90%
Did somebody else do it to them?

00:37:42.305 --> 00:37:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but it's awfully
sinister considering the fact

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.730 align:middle line:84%
that the evidence suggests
that these two things were

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:84%
responsible for destroying
the atmosphere of this planet.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:57.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems that was
presented in Christopher Nolan's

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.480 align:middle line:84%
movie, Oppenheimer, before they
did the first Trinity test,

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.552 align:middle line:84%
you see Cillian Murphy as
Oppenheimer, Matt Damon,

00:38:04.552 --> 00:38:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and they're having
this discussion,

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.070 align:middle line:84%
what are the
chances this test is

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
going to ignite the
atmosphere of Earth

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and destroy all life
here on this planet?

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And Cillian Murphy, as
Oppenheimer responds,

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:16.980 align:middle line:90%
there is a near zero chance.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.250 align:middle line:90%
They weren't sure.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Now fortunately, we didn't
kill everything here on Earth,

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:24.520 align:middle line:84%
but that's because the Trinity
test didn't have enough power.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But the power that
Dr. Brandenburg

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:33.300 align:middle line:84%
has shown that destroyed
this atmosphere of Mars

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.300 align:middle line:84%
was 10 to 100
times more powerful

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.980 align:middle line:84%
than the impact that is credited
for killing the dinosaurs here

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:40.780 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.397 align:middle line:90%
That's strong.

00:38:42.397 --> 00:38:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So Brian,
we have the images

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.362 align:middle line:84%
of Gary Leggiere
and the pyramids.

00:38:46.362 --> 00:38:47.320 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at?

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.850 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: Gary lives in Colorado.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.460 align:middle line:10%
He has found dozens
of these structures.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.960 align:middle line:10%
These are about 3/4 of a mile
long, I call them the triangles.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.380 align:middle line:10%
What natural
process creates what

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:03.340 align:middle line:10%
appeared to be these pyramidal
mounds with a line underneath?

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:10%
I don't see that as being water
erosion or even wind erosion.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.150 align:middle line:10%
These things are huge.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.310 align:middle line:10%
I just don't understand
what would cause

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:13.570 align:middle line:10%
these things to be formed.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.410 align:middle line:10%
So Gary is one of these
independent Mars researchers

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.402 align:middle line:10%
and he's doing this
in his spare time

00:39:18.402 --> 00:39:19.860 align:middle line:10%
and really deserves
a lot of credit

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.670 align:middle line:10%
for finding these
interesting structures.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:22.470 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: Amazing.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:23.312 align:middle line:10%
But those craters--

00:39:23.312 --> 00:39:25.020 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: And here's
another one he found.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.170 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: --they look huge.

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:31.020 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: So here, do
volcanoes look like that?

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.170 align:middle line:10%
We see it next to a crater,
yes, a crater is huge.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:36.680 align:middle line:10%
And here's something
that's probably

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.090 align:middle line:10%
10 times the size of
the pyramid in Egypt,

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:44.010 align:middle line:10%
with obvious signs of sides
and geometry and symmetry.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.050 align:middle line:10%
Why are we not taking
a closer look at that?

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.327 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: 90-degree angles.

00:39:48.327 --> 00:39:49.410 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: And look at this.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:50.368 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: What is that?

00:39:50.368 --> 00:39:54.650 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: To me, that
looks like a column

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:56.910 align:middle line:10%
buried into the side of a hill.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.850 align:middle line:10%
It's smooth, it's
circular on the end,

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:03.240 align:middle line:10%
amidst a rugged
landscape surrounding it.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.550 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: I just got
back from Puma Punku,

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:middle line:10%
and you see that everywhere.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.790 align:middle line:10%
You see columns half buried in
the dirt, you trip over them.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:13.885 align:middle line:10%
I have to tell you, that image
looks like it's from Puma Punku.

00:40:13.885 --> 00:40:15.510 align:middle line:10%
>>DOBBS: Again, here's
another example.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.240 align:middle line:10%
Jean Ward from South
Africa discovered

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.467 align:middle line:10%
this, Teotihuacan in Mexico.

00:40:19.467 --> 00:40:21.300 align:middle line:10%
If you cover that with
a little bit of dirt,

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.150 align:middle line:10%
would it not look like
something like that

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.460 align:middle line:10%
that we find there on Mars?

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.852 align:middle line:10%
Well, anyway, Jean Ward
from South Africa, I

00:40:27.852 --> 00:40:29.060 align:middle line:10%
have to mention his name too.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.860 align:middle line:10%
He's doing outstanding work.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.850 align:middle line:10%
And this independent
Mars researcher community

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:34.790 align:middle line:10%
has been marginalized.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:35.600 align:middle line:10%
That's the problem.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:39.910 align:middle line:10%
NASA releases the photos, the
independent researcher community

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:43.143 align:middle line:10%
sifts through them, makes the
discovery, and publishes saying,

00:40:43.143 --> 00:40:44.810 align:middle line:10%
hey look, there's
something strange here

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:46.477 align:middle line:10%
and we need to take
a closer look at it.

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:49.220 align:middle line:10%
Because NASA should be doing
that work, but they're not.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Is Earth ready
for this information

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:57.110 align:middle line:84%
that Mars had an
ancient civilization?

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:58.460 align:middle line:90%
They came and went.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It could indicate our
future here too, as well.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we should be
aware of the possibility

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:08.630 align:middle line:90%
of our own demise.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Could that really change
things here on Earth?

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.765 align:middle line:84%
Are we ready for
something like that?

00:41:13.765 --> 00:41:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOBBS: Some people are,
but some people aren't.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot of
information about Mars.

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:24.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a story about Mars,
starting with the microbes

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and then leading up to the
possibility of intelligent life

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:35.580 align:middle line:84%
in the past that people do
need to understand because it's

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:38.100 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest
stories that I think

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.665 align:middle line:90%
has yet to really been told.

00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:42.840 align:middle line:84%
When I was sitting around
trying to figure out

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.257 align:middle line:84%
what I'm going to do with all
the stuff that I'm learning,

00:41:45.257 --> 00:41:47.820 align:middle line:84%
that's why I'm now becoming
a public messenger on this

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.723 align:middle line:84%
because I find it so
incredibly fascinating,

00:41:49.723 --> 00:41:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and I think more people
need to know about it,

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.980 align:middle line:84%
but the implications
are terrifying.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:58.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we can show that
Mars was a lot more like Earth,

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.880 align:middle line:84%
then they might be a
little bit more open to it

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.830 align:middle line:90%
from an emotional perspective.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:04.983 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Is it possible
that we are Martians?

00:42:04.983 --> 00:42:07.785 align:middle line:90%


00:42:07.785 --> 00:42:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOBBS: Why not?

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:13.530 align:middle line:10%
Mars was like Earth
in the distant past,

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:16.710 align:middle line:10%
at a time when Earth
wasn't even like Earth.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Earth was not habitable.

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Mars was habitable before.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So if it gave rise to
intelligent life that

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:29.280 align:middle line:84%
created artifacts, tools,
signs of civilization,

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and by extension structures
that we can see from space

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and maybe developed a space
program, it's plausible.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:10%
And we see evidence that there
was an intelligent civilization

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.290 align:middle line:10%
there before, based on the
orbiter photographs which

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:10%
have photographed what
arguably look like pyramids.

conversation, Brian.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.327 align:middle line:84%
