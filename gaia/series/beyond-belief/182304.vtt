>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.550 align:middle line:10%
Psychic medium
Marla Frees with us

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:10%
today, spending 25 years as
a very successful television

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:10%
and stage actress
before devoting herself

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:10%
to her current work
as a psychic medium.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:90%
She is a noted author.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Her best selling memoir is
called, "American Psychic--

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:84%

to Hollywood,
Heaven, and Beyond."

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
With us, Marla Frees
back on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:90%
How are you, Marla?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.917 align:middle line:84%
>>MARLA FREES: I'm great,
thank you so much, George.

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We had such
a great response

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
when you were on with me
a couple of years ago.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it again.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Let's top it.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: [LAUGHS]

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in the psychic realm?

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen for you?

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.682 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well you know, it was--

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
first off, I wasn't
a big believer.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.618 align:middle line:10%
I didn't believe in talking to
the dead, the psychic stuff,

00:01:09.618 --> 00:01:10.418 align:middle line:10%
you know.

00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:10%
It was interesting,
because there

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.393 align:middle line:10%
are a few things that happened
in my childhood that was really

00:01:14.393 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:10%
quite remarkable.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.513 align:middle line:84%
But when you become an adult and
you sort of are living a life,

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's one
of those things

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
where you're not so sure
you want to step into that.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:90%
But I was actually stalked.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stalked?

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.765 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:28.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By?

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: In the mid
'90s, I came in contact

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
with somebody that was
basically a con artist.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
of that encounter

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
that I thought,
oh my God, I don't

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:84%
know what's happening
here, because I was really

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:90%
asking for--

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I was praying, I was
meditating, asking for help,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:90%
and I actually heard a voice.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't the
kind of voice that

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.660 align:middle line:84%
was guiding me before, you
know, that internal voice.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:90%
This was a dead person.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And she was basically
giving me information

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.100 align:middle line:90%
about this con artist.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.147 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it help you?

00:01:57.147 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Absolutely.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:84%
It led me to go to
law enforcement,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:90%
we put him in jail.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God!

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.365 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: But the
whole point about this

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle line:84%
was I ended up working
with law enforcement

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.000 align:middle line:90%
and they were working with me.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd been picking up crime scene
photos, getting information off

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.613 align:middle line:84%
of them, and then in turn,
I turned around and started

00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:90%
working for law enforcement.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You always had
a-- and I always believed

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.442 align:middle line:90%
this-- psychic abilities.

00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well
everybody does, yeah.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it kicked
in all of a sudden.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.513 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, yeah.

00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
There was something
that-- there's

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:84%
an accident with my horse when
I was a child that I heard

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
a voice, and that was
really, really dramatic,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:84%
because it was one
of those dynamics

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.445 align:middle line:90%
that I had to pay attention.

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you have to
pay attention like that,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:84%
you start to think,
well, is it God?

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Is it Jesus?

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Is this my angels?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.910 align:middle line:90%
What's happening here.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And basically, with
that particular voice

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.390 align:middle line:84%
that came to me-- that woman,
it came out of nowhere,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:90%
and I had to pay attention.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was when I first started
working with Lyn Buchanan

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and training as a
psychic spy, yeah.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think sometimes
that voice is the inner you?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Or is it something from outside?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I
think that it's both.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that our
intuition, which

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
is our God-given
birthright, is something

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:90%
that we're tapping into.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
This larger consciousness
system that most people

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:90%
like to call God.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:90%
We are attached to that.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've been
working with scientists,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and they, too, are explaining
exactly what that is.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a precognitive
ability that

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
can be explained
through science,

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be happy
to talk about that.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your new book is
out, "American Psychic."

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at a
little bit about this.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: OK.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.400 align:middle line:84%
It began in the
heartland of America.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:84%
My spiritual journey of love,
loss, joy, and forgiveness,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:90%
with devastating secrets.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
A voice, a presence saved
my life in an accident

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:90%
with my horse.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.415 align:middle line:84%
I began to trust
that voice of spirit.

00:03:56.415 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:10%
But my life changed
with murder, mobsters,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:10%
Hollywood heartthrobs,
romance, and mayhem.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:10%
Acting became a
lifeline to healing.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
But that career was
ripped away and replaced

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:90%
by my true calling--

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:90%
psychic awareness.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Visions and messages
from deceased loved ones

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:90%
are all part of it.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
From the heartland to
Hollywood, Heaven and beyond.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.703 align:middle line:84%
Quite a boisterous
career there, huh?

00:04:34.703 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: [LAUGHS] I was busy.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you like the acting
part of your life and career?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well yes.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it
really saved my life.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
There was-- I had
trauma in my childhood.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And this was something
that if I could basically

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
do what my mother needed
and wanted me to do,

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:90%
I would survive her.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was basically getting
into the television set.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when you say
you had trauma as a child,

00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:84%
your family looked fine, you
look like you were raised well.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Were you?

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well yes.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a beautiful,
bucolic existence

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
in a small town in Pennsylvania,
but there were secrets.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And my father was a
World War II veteran

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
who came back and
was an alcoholic,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:90%
and my mother had some problems.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Severe problems.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Mental illness.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you were
able overcome that?

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.792 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes, absolutely.

00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:84%
But it was the
healing of doing that.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.440 align:middle line:84%
It was-- I basically
had to go outside

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.100 align:middle line:84%
of myself asking for assistance
on every possible level

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
to try and survive
what was going on.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about "American Psychic"

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:90%
for a moment.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Tell me the theme of the book.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, the
theme is literally

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:84%
how we are guided by a
spiritual consciousness,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that we are all guided
whether we know it or not.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I believe
that spirit, God,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.970 align:middle line:84%
the larger consciousness system
had my back even when I didn't.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So people go on
the ride with me,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:90%
they experience an awakening.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
They also experience
the trauma that I had,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.955 align:middle line:84%
which gives them freedom
to talk about their own.

00:06:02.955 --> 00:06:04.330 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
greatest things

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:90%
that's happened with the book.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a story about you?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, yes, it
is the memoir, yeah.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the giving other
people an opportunity

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to see how I
survived it, and also

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:84%
how spirits' guidance helped
me with this intuition,

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:90%
with this knowingness.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.815 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole unfolding
of that happening,

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's happening
to people all over the world.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are you today
with that psychic ability?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: I feel that it's the
greatest gift for us to have

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:90%
this connection to God--

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.930 align:middle line:84%
a larger consciousness
system where

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
we can access information
that gives us information

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:84%
about our health, saving
us in certain situations,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:84%
listening to that
intuition, tuning into it,

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and also accessing
deceased loved ones.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, having
that love continue

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
is what's really
helpful to people.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that God gives us
this amazing ability, that we

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.100 align:middle line:84%
are able to access
deceased loved ones' love

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and connection, what's
better than that?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
convinced this other side,

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:90%
this other realm is real?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:90%
Exists?

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:90%
I believe that--

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you had doubts.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Oh, I was
highly skeptical.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And you know, here's the
thing about skepticism.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:84%
When you have an attitude about
it, when you're judgmental,

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:84%
when you say, oh,
that's a bunch of crap,

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
be careful, because it
will just come right around

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be doing it yourself.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.902 align:middle line:84%
It's the most-- it's the people
that are most judgmental that

00:07:31.902 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:90%
get the most surprised.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:07:33.735 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: But you have to have
your own personal experience

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.410 align:middle line:90%
for this.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't
convince a skeptic

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
unless a skeptic has a
dream about their mother

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:84%
coming in and speaking to them,
or another deceased loved one,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:84%
or as you and I
have both had been

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.560 align:middle line:84%
warned in a precognitive
way about an accident that

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:90%
was waiting to happen.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Unless we have our own
personal experiences,

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:90%
we don't really believe.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But what is it?

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.520 align:middle line:90%
I still can't figure that out.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Because you've talked
about the God relationship,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and it makes it sound like
there's an angelic realm that's

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:84%
going to help us, and they
tell us things into our mind.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:84%
How do we know
that we don't have

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.310 align:middle line:84%
a mechanism within our physical
body, some kind of system,

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:84%
another sense that
kicks in and is

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.940 align:middle line:84%
just a very normal intuitive
thing that's part of our body?

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:90%
How do we know it's not that?

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: I completely
agree with you.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So here's the thing-- we
all have belief systems.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Most of us come out of a
Judeo-Christian background.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
wonderful foundation.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not throwing
that out at all.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.280 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that there
is this consciousness,

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.900 align:middle line:84%
this possible
virtual reality where

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:84%
we can access information that
doesn't come with the dogma.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't come with the
ideology of people owning God.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: So I'm-- that's
what I've been interested

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
in, because I know
that if I can do this,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:84%
not having believed in it, that
other people can do it, too.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in the midst of helping
CEOs and business associates

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and bank owners and
corporate people,

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:84%
people who are left-brain
access this information.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it works for
some, but not for everyone.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well I'm not so sure.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Meaning-- well, let's
put it this way--

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not everybody
can access this.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I think
that if you are skeptical,

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:84%
you will do everything
in your possible--

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:90%
the possible way that you can.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Any-- you will find evidence
to make somebody wrong.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
We live in a
schadenfreude society

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:84%
where we are looking at
people's pain, right?

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Making people wrong.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Being gleeful about
that kind of dynamic.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
When in fact, we all have
the ability to access this.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:90%
I do believe this.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you wrote
"American Psychic,"

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:90%
what was your goal?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Did you want people
to know about you

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.997 align:middle line:90%
and what you went through?

00:10:01.997 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I'm
just an example--

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or were
you teaching them?

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well I'm--

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm just an example.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that by virtue
of my experience,

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.100 align:middle line:84%
I am hopefully teaching them
that there is something more.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:90%
There's also healing.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:84%
The forgiveness
that is necessary.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
The trajectory of
the book, George,

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.030 align:middle line:84%
is the forgiveness of
what happened in my life.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
crucial when people

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
are traumatized that they get
assistance, and that's really--

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
as soon as I started
getting assistance,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
that opened up a whole
door of awareness.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
That's when all the psychic
stuff and all the awareness

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:84%
has started pouring in, because
I moved the pain out and away

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.980 align:middle line:90%
and healed it.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say
is the most dramatic aspect

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:90%
of "American Psychic?"

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I think the
dynamic is the trajectory

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:90%
that we all go on.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd like to believe
through the experiences

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:84%
that I have had that
we choose to come here.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the
dynamic of choosing my parents

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:84%
set me up for being
here with you today,

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:84%
because it really
is the thing that

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:middle line:84%
taught me everything
I needed to learn,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.610 align:middle line:84%
even though it was
tragic in many ways.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:84%
The things that I
experienced were

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
rich, and people-- the
people that read the book

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:90%
go on that same journey.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.300 align:middle line:84%
They find that same thing
out within themselves

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.710 align:middle line:90%
as they read the book.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.588 align:middle line:84%
They get excited and they
want to tell their own story.

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They love telling
the their own stories.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the little
clip we saw about you,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
there was some
reference to the mob.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: [LAUGHS]

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
that all about?

00:11:39.655 --> 00:11:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Well actually, that's one of
those very colorful things

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:90%
that happened in my past.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:84%
When I left college, I left
Miami University of Ohio,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:90%
I decided to leave.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And I auditioned with an
opera company in Milwaukee.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up living
in a building owned,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.612 align:middle line:84%
operated, and occupied
by the Milwaukee mob.

00:12:00.612 --> 00:12:01.412 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:12:01.412 --> 00:12:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Mm-hmm.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.763 align:middle line:90%
The Balistrieris.

00:12:02.763 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
got to know you?

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, the funny
thing was, is I auditioned

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:90%
for this opera company.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And Joe Balistrieri,
who happened

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.434 align:middle line:84%
to be the son of Frank,
the mob boss himself,

00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:15.434 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hey, I'm Frank!

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: [LAUGHS]

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, Joe loved opera.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
quite wonderful.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:90%
They were really good to me.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.877 align:middle line:84%
It was a time in my life
when I needed support.

00:12:26.877 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Who thought it would come
from a family like that?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
know who they were?

00:12:31.105 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well not at first.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I found out I
was living in that building, I

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:90%
kind of--

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I had to find out that yeah,
that this is who they were.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So the dynamic of
it was, I was naive,

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see anybody
kissing rings or--

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
all I had was the "Godfather"
movie to go after.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: But the
interesting thing

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.560 align:middle line:84%
was that my awareness
and my psychic,

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:84%
you know-- my psychic
awareness kicked in every time

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Frank Balistrieri showed up.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.640 align:middle line:84%
The hairs on the back
of my neck stood up.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, your
book that has come out

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.740 align:middle line:10%
is doing quite well.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.085 align:middle line:90%
And you're on a tour.

00:13:07.085 --> 00:13:07.915 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:13:07.915 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've been touring.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Yes, I've been
touring all these--

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.277 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long now?

00:13:11.277 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, it came out last
June, so I continue the tour.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you do a book like
that, what you have to do

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
is go make money so that
you can go do the tour.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.508 align:middle line:84%
So I've been touring around
and it's been amazing.

00:13:22.508 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do people
generally say to you when

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.750 align:middle line:90%
they come up to you?

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
After they've perhaps
read the book?

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES:

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.445 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
think that they are so

00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:90%
moved for their own reasons.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they see themselves
in this book, George.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.618 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point.

00:13:35.618 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:90%
They see their own trajectory--

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's their memoir.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Yeah-- it's
their memoir, too.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.465 align:middle line:90%
And that's really wonderful.

00:13:42.465 --> 00:13:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
people generally

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:84%
look for when they
think they're psychic?

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
What are they trying
to do with their life?

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I think that
all of us need connection.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Need connection to a source.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
important, even

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:90%
for the science-based people.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Science-based people who want to
ignore the idea of God or they

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.460 align:middle line:84%
think they're
beyond that, they're

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.113 align:middle line:90%
getting downloads all the time.

00:14:09.113 --> 00:14:10.280 align:middle line:90%
They're getting information.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes ego makes them
think that it's theirs, right?

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just them, it's
their intelligence

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:90%
that makes them so smart.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So the dynamic of being
connected, we all need that.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And the psychic
connection that we

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:90%
make to another consciousness--

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:84%
my goodness, it makes us feel
as though we're not alone,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:84%
as though we're
part of the system,

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
part of the universal
consciousness,

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:84%
part of a larger
consciousness system.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find that some
people have misperceptions

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.970 align:middle line:90%
about psychic people?

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Oh, yeah.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:90%
It's really kind of sad.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I did, too.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Made fun of them, thought that
people talking to the dead

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:90%
were crazy, all of it.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.980 align:middle line:84%
I had lots of judgment about
it until it happened to me.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:84%
I think the dynamic
is how we reframe it,

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:84%
because people keep
thinking that it is--

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:84%
it's not biblical or it's
not Christian or it's--

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:90%
and oh my goodness, the Bible--

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or it's demonic.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes!

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some people think that.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well of
course, because anything

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:84%
that threatens someone else's
reality is challenging to them.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.980 align:middle line:90%
They like to make it wrong.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:84%
But the Bible's
filled with prophecy,

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.780 align:middle line:90%
vision, a precognition.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's all about that.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So psychic function is
actually science-based.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find that
when you get into this realm,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.658 align:middle line:90%
it makes you feel better?

00:15:33.658 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well I do it all
the time, so I love it.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.533 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly?

00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah, I love it.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I love being able to
give people a way out.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Give them information that
perhaps shifts them in ways

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.550 align:middle line:90%
for them to move forward.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.407 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a psychic
did that for me.

00:15:47.407 --> 00:15:48.240 align:middle line:90%
It was really funny.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Like last night when
I was having dinner,

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.752 align:middle line:84%
the waiter and I were talking
about probable reality, and--

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who brought that up?

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.760 align:middle line:90%
You or him?

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well actually, he
asked me why I was in town,

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:90%
and I talked about this.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm interested in
personal reality, and I said--

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was stalking you?

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah-- no.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] He wasn't stalking me.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:10%
But the dynamic of it
was, it reminded me

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.550 align:middle line:10%
of seeing Sonia Choquette,
the first psychic

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:10%
that I ever saw years ago.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:84%
When we were both 25 years
old, I went to see her.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And she basically told me
that I was going to Cleveland,

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up
going to Cleveland.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And in Cleveland, I was
working as an actress there,

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:84%
but I started feeling
interested in metaphysics.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it was because
Sonia flipped on my switch.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: But I took the
Jane Roberts Seth book,

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:84%
"The Nature of
Personal Reality,"

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.140 align:middle line:90%
out did the Cleveland library--

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I did end up paying
them for that book--

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:84%
but I took that book and I
was like, oh my God, this

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:90%
is amazing!

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:84%
To think that a
channeled entity could

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.730 align:middle line:84%
come through a woman like
that and give information

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.405 align:middle line:90%
that was so profound--

00:16:51.405 --> 00:16:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The right things?

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes!

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Amazing stuff.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Seth speaks.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes, all of that.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's what sort of started
me inching my way through this.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I was stalked, and
then US military psychic spies.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often do you
meet skeptics about this?

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, curiously
enough, I went back

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.819 align:middle line:84%
to my hometown, which
was part of the tour.

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And my hometown is
Christian-based, real heartland

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.480 align:middle line:90%
of America.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's
opposition-- there were

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.335 align:middle line:84%
girls in my hometown in my class
that said, oh no, no, no, we

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
don't want anything
to do with psychic.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
We don't have anything
to do with it.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of the reasons
I use the terminology,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.265 align:middle line:84%
so I could get the
conversation going.

00:17:31.265 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
heard of mediums.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:90%
James Von Praagh--

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Oh yeah, well, he's
in my book, I trained with him.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and Mavis Pitilla.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.543 align:middle line:84%
They got together one day
to talk about medium shows.

00:17:41.543 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:10%
>>MAVIS PATILLA:
I think sometimes

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:10%
with the skeptics,
of course, it's

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:10%
because they're afraid
to believe in it, yeah.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.122 align:middle line:10%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Fear-based.

00:17:48.122 --> 00:17:50.670 align:middle line:10%
>>PATILLA: You know fear-based
or it's-- they've become

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.390 align:middle line:10%
so caught up in the dogma that
they can't step out of that

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:10%
and explore the other avenues.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.960 align:middle line:10%
And I feel that
it's right for them.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:10%
I don't feel that
everybody should believe

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:10%
in life after death
a medium, I believe

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:10%
they should follow the truth of
spiritual development leading

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:10%
to the spirit while
making a contact,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.572 align:middle line:10%
whether it be
subjective or objective.

00:18:17.572 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:10%
>>PRAAGH: Mavis,
I agree with that,

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:10%
but I also think in
my own thing here.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:10%
I also think that
for some skeptics,

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.770 align:middle line:10%
some believers, that
they are afraid.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.620 align:middle line:10%
I think it is fear-based,
because their whole world,

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:10%
their whole paradigm has--

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:10%
their belief system
has been set up

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.648 align:middle line:10%
in certain principles or
a certain way of life,

00:18:35.648 --> 00:18:37.440 align:middle line:10%
that if they introduced
in this way of life

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.843 align:middle line:10%
a spirituality-- a sense
of spirituality, spiritual

00:18:39.843 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:10%
principles, they're going
to have to change up

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:10%
their whole way of thinking,
and they don't want to do that.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:10%
>>PATILLA: I'm chuckling, James,
because that happened to me.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:10%
I was so much a
Christian-based girl

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:10%
coming up through Sunday school
and confirmation and things

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.330 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:10%
But when it started to happen
to me, I just panicked.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.780 align:middle line:10%
I thought something evil or
something bad had got me.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:08.220 align:middle line:10%
It's taken many years for me to
understand that really, I just

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:10%
needed to open the
door of the soul

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.140 align:middle line:10%
and it would take
me on that pathway.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mavis has got
it together, doesn't she?

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.098 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes, she does.

00:19:16.098 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly right, that's
exactly what happened to me.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Raised Lutheran, became
a born-again Christian,

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
went off into the world,
having my own experiences,

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:90%
and then bam--

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.690 align:middle line:90%
this has happened.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Well I talk about James because
we both had the same vision.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.400 align:middle line:90%
I was watching him on TV.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:84%
This is when I had an attitude,
when I didn't believe in it,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and I saw him and I go,
oh, that's a bunch of crap.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I get a call from a
girlfriend that says, hey,

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I can't meet with
you this weekend.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go see
James Van Praagh.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And we had this
conversation I said, oh.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:90%
She said, please, go see him.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.198 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was that here?

00:19:50.198 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: It was in Los Angeles.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And was that about
seven, eight, nine years ago?

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:57.792 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, it was in 1995.

00:19:57.792 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, that
was before I saw him.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:84%
It was before his
first book came out.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I went to
see him at an event,

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:90%
and he just mesmerized people.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, that's just it.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.310 align:middle line:90%
I basically went to see him.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.050 align:middle line:90%
And because I was such--

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I had such an attitude
and I thought, OK,

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to be--

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You wanted him to fail.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, I wanted to--

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.720 align:middle line:84%
actually, I'm not
that kind of person,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.370 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want him to fail.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I kind of wanted to be an
investigative reporter.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.630 align:middle line:90%
But when I went--

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A skeptical one.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Exactly.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But when I went, I came home and
got down on my hands and knees

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and basically prayed and
said, I have no idea what

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:90%
this psychic stuff is about.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Could you please
help me with this?

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me what talking
to the dead is, and--

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
oh, and help me
with the stalker.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.823 align:middle line:84%
I ended up having a dream,
and I told my girlfriend

00:20:49.823 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:84%
about the dream
who happened to be

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.610 align:middle line:84%
best friends with his
personal assistant,

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and I was in James Von
Praagh's house the next day.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about that?

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: And I didn't
leave for three years.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And he's the one that
told me I was a medium.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You asked for help?

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you go it.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: I asked for help.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You never had
asked for help before.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, at that point
around my psychic stuff,

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:90%
no I hadn't.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I'd asked for help
about my mother.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So isn't it
interesting that when you ask,

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:90%
the door opens?

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: That's right.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we are
all capable of doing it.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.140 align:middle line:84%
If we don't-- if we
get past the fear--

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and they talked
about it so well.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.950 align:middle line:84%
They just explain the fear,
the fear about being wrong.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:84%
We have to be
willing to be wrong.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As a psychic?

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, as a
person, as a person.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.978 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you have
to admit that, too.

00:21:40.978 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: I think so.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.958 align:middle line:84%
Once you're able to
admit these problems,

00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:45.000 align:middle line:90%
then you can change them.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:84%
You can't change anything
you're not being--

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:84%
you're not willing
to be aware of.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where has your
book tour taken you?

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I first
started in Chicago.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:90%
I go to the places--

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I've been to the places that
are significant in the book.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So I was in Chicago, and I met
with my dear friend Jim Corti,

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
who initially put me on
stage in my first equity

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:84%
show, who is now the artistic
director of the Paramount

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Theatre.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So I did a big group at the
Copley Theater in Illinois,

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and then I was also
with Jen Weigel.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:10%
Jen Weigel's written
numerous books

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:10%
about psychics and mediums,
and she has a great--

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:10%
she has a wonderful program
at the Wilmette Theatre

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.690 align:middle line:10%
where she invites
people to speak

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:10%
and they talk about
their books, and I

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.870 align:middle line:10%
had a very interesting
experience there, George.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.873 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:22:30.873 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, part of the
thing that I do before I go out

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and I work with a large
group is I do a Marla map.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I sit in the back room
and I start to feel,

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.090 align:middle line:84%
oh, this person had
thyroid problem,

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:84%
this person drowned
or had somebody

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.070 align:middle line:84%
that died that's drowned,
and I make this map.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I get out,
I start to talk

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:84%
about that and I have
people raise their hand so

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.545 align:middle line:84%
that I can go out into
the audience and say--

00:22:52.545 --> 00:22:53.503 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you are.

00:22:53.503 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: There you are.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:10%
But I was walking between
the two down in the theater,

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:10%
and all of a sudden, I
didn't know where I was.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:10%
I was accessing a deceased
loved one in her kitchen,

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.610 align:middle line:10%
and we were talking
about the relationship

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:10%
that her granddaughter
was having that

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:10%
was abusive with her husband.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And I swear, I literally
was talking out loud saying,

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I've never been here before,
I think I'm on the other side.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.378 align:middle line:90%
Have you left your body?

00:23:23.378 --> 00:23:24.795 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I
knew that I was--

00:23:24.795 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I could feel myself, and I
knew that I was in the theater,

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:90%
but I was in that kitchen.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:90%
I was so in that kitchen.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
remote viewing?

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: I think I bi-located.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
The way that we
sometimes do that,

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.500 align:middle line:84%
but I'd never experienced
that in a large setting.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm usually able to have
enough distance between it,

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.970 align:middle line:84%
but I had had a
session with someone

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:52.440 align:middle line:84%
that had used tuning forks
on my brain that afternoon.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.740 align:middle line:90%
So something was happening--

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 82 megahertz
or whatever that is.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Something happened
where I accessed another level.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.177 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
feel disoriented?

00:24:01.177 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I talked my way
through it to pull myself back.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.537 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Because I could hear
the deceased person talking,

00:24:06.537 --> 00:24:08.540 align:middle line:84%
so I wanted to keep
getting that information.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.010 align:middle line:90%
But that is interesting.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:84%
I was going into a
database that didn't

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
feel like my physical
matter reality.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.060 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're
on the tour, what do

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:90%
people want to know from you?

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: People come and
they are really more curious

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.450 align:middle line:90%
about their own intuition.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Which is wonderful.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
they want to know.

00:24:32.405 --> 00:24:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: And that's what I'm
trying to help people do.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Helping them access
their own, going

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
places that I feel really
comfortable about talking

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.790 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.880 align:middle line:84%
There are few people and
places that I would recommend

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:84%
to them in a heartbeat so that
they can have more education.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you changed
people's minds and perceptions

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:90%
about the other side?

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:90%
About the psychic world?

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:84%
They come in as skeptics
and they leave as believers?

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: I think so
on some situations.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:90%
But that's not my job.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:84%
My job is not to
change anybody, my job

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:84%
is just to deliver
the information.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you do.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: And I do.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And how do you
know you get feedback?

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.830 align:middle line:10%
>>FREES: Well--

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or do you?

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.830 align:middle line:10%
>>FREES: Most of the
time I get feedback,

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:10%
because if I'm discussing
something with someone,

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm giving them information and
they could sit there and keep

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:10%
saying no, no, but that would
be ridiculous, if in fact I

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:29.110 align:middle line:10%
was talking to them about
information that was important.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm seeing the fact that
this person went and had

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:84%
some dental work done,
they had an abscess

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:90%
that led to something else.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:84%
They go yeah, that's
actually right,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.630 align:middle line:84%
my mother had that
cardio problem

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:84%
because of the endocarditis
because of her teeth.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.760 align:middle line:90%
So I can feel things like that.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And they usually
give me feedback

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:84%
so I know I'm on
the right track.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you like
a health psychic?

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%
If you had to say how you
specialize, what would that be?

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Mmm.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.918 align:middle line:84%
Well there are a few things
that I really think that I'm--

00:25:59.918 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you a medium, too?

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well yes, of course!

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm talking to
dead people, absolutely.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.190 align:middle line:90%
But I'm also seeing--

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I see the trajectories
or I see the--

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.980 align:middle line:84%
in the psychic realm, I
see probability factors,

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:90%
which is about future stuff.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And I see-- people
from the industry,

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
the entertainment
industry come see me.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They're producers,
they're directors.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:90%
I can see aspects of things.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there was a show
that is just debuting this year

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:90%
called "The Fix."

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.332 align:middle line:10%
It's Marcia Clark's show,
the prosecutor during--

00:26:34.332 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: From the
OJ Simpson trial.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that show,
the inception of that

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:90%
show three years ago.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:90%
I saw the trajectory of it--

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.220 align:middle line:84%
I knew it would be produced,
I knew again on the air,

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and I just had this feeling
about it the entire time.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So I kept saying to the
producers, look, I just see it.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's some problems
here, you need to fix this,

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.477 align:middle line:84%
I can see that, but I
could feel that that

00:26:56.477 --> 00:26:58.060 align:middle line:84%
was going to go on
the air, and that's

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.745 align:middle line:84%
some of the reasons
why people see me.

00:26:59.745 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they believe you?

00:27:02.905 --> 00:27:04.190 align:middle line:90%
At the time?

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Um--

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.865 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do now.

00:27:05.865 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, yeah.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:90%
"The Fix," the women that are--

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.090 align:middle line:84%
the writers of "The
Fix" have a podcast

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.940 align:middle line:84%
called "Happier in
Hollywood," and I'm considered

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:90%
their resident psychic.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marla, you
said earlier that there

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:84%
was a role of science
with some of this.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Explain that a little bit more.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well you
know what, George?

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.890 align:middle line:84%
When this started happening
and I started getting help,

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.480 align:middle line:84%
it was really the
remote viewers.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:84%
It was Lyn Buchanan who
helped me more than anything.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And that helped me make this
paranormal conversation normal.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And I have been looking
at science ever since,

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.840 align:middle line:84%
starting with Lyn telling me
about the Monroe Institute.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great institute.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: And that--

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.598 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --out-of-body
experiences.

00:27:48.598 --> 00:27:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Out-of-body
experiences.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But the binaural beats
that were developed

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:56.440 align:middle line:84%
by Tom Campbell and Dennis
Mennerich and Bob at the time

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.890 align:middle line:84%
gave people access to altered
states of consciousness, which

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:04.750 align:middle line:84%
is the largest educational
center in the entire world that

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.508 align:middle line:90%
is doing this.

00:28:06.508 --> 00:28:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
a little bit more

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:90%
about your Monroe Institute.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.910 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger,
I picked up a book

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:19.690 align:middle line:84%
called "Journeys out of Body" by
Robert Monroe, who at any time

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.220 align:middle line:84%
had an incredible ability
to go out of body.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: More so than anybody
that I had ever studied,

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and I studied them all
even at that young age.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.500 align:middle line:90%
He was amazing with what he did.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.500 align:middle line:84%
He's not with us anymore,
but he had an institute.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.803 align:middle line:90%
Had you ever met him?

00:28:36.803 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: No, he died
before I got there.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ahh.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.937 align:middle line:84%
But of course, his essence
and his legacy lives on.

00:28:43.937 --> 00:28:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Institute's
still around.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.728 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Oh my goodness, yes.

00:28:46.728 --> 00:28:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm sending people
there all the time.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.340 align:middle line:84%
I really do believe it is
one of the greatest places

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.340 align:middle line:84%
that people can feel
safe using binaural beats

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and accessing altered
states of consciousness.

00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well we're bringing you
Robert Monroe to the program.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.580 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT MONROE: After we exit
this particular life soldier,

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:10%
we are saying,
instead of going home

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.030 align:middle line:10%
and what I call having
escape velocity to go home,

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.960 align:middle line:10%
some things happened
in living that life.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.330 align:middle line:10%
We've picked up a load factor.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.490 align:middle line:10%
There was friction
along the way,

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:10%
and that represented--
so instead

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:10%
of moving out and
having escape velocity,

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.350 align:middle line:10%
we start turning around that
and it's our decision, no

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.420 align:middle line:10%
one else's, that's important.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.440 align:middle line:10%
Our decision.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:10%
We say, well, I think I'll
go back just once more,

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.370 align:middle line:10%
and then this next
time I think I'll

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:40.210 align:middle line:10%
be a male instead of a female,
that ought to be more fun.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.250 align:middle line:10%
Just once more-- and
then I'll go home.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.160 align:middle line:10%
So what happens is,
instead of moving this way,

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.580 align:middle line:10%
we loop around and go
back being a human again,

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.070 align:middle line:10%
and go back and have
another human experience,

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:10%
another lifetime.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.430 align:middle line:10%
And we come out again,
and we're already

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:10%
this time-- but this time we've
had even a greater load factor,

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.420 align:middle line:10%
don't you see?

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.780 align:middle line:10%
We've slowed up a little more.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.122 align:middle line:10%
We haven't got the
speed that we did.

00:30:04.122 --> 00:30:05.080 align:middle line:10%
We have a greater load.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.010 align:middle line:10%
And so we're now in orbit,
and we have a decaying orbit,

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.410 align:middle line:10%
because when we come up
around the orbit like this,

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.160 align:middle line:10%
instead of going
on, we say, oh, I'm

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.450 align:middle line:10%
gotta go back because
I have never seen Paris

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.720 align:middle line:10%
and I'd like to go to
Paris for once in my life,

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.130 align:middle line:10%
and I'd like to just go there.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.070 align:middle line:10%
So whole purpose to
go back and live again

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.960 align:middle line:10%
so that I can go to Paris.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.480 align:middle line:10%
And I've heard so much about
Paris, I want to go to Paris.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.360 align:middle line:10%
So I'll go and live again
so I can go to Paris.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.740 align:middle line:10%
And as you can
see, each time you

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:37.090 align:middle line:10%
pick up in each succeeding
lifetime a greater load factor,

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:10%
so that as you go through this,
your orbit decays more and more

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.660 align:middle line:10%
as you go through this--

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:10%
living these successive
layers until you

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:10%
get locked in tighter and
tighter and tighter-- til

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:51.220 align:middle line:10%
you are locked in
being human so tight,

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.050 align:middle line:10%
that you forget
where you came from.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:10%
You've lost all of the desire
to even depart and go home.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.140 align:middle line:10%
You've lost it all.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:03.102 align:middle line:10%
Because-- and this is so
overwhelmingly addictive,

00:31:03.102 --> 00:31:05.560 align:middle line:10%
that you can't think of anything
else but this time, space,

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:10%
physical matter, all the things
that take place in there,

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:10%
and no matter how hard you try,
you can't get away from it.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.410 align:middle line:10%
The reason being there's no
law, but when you, quote, "die,"

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.950 align:middle line:10%
and instead of going home,
you make the decision.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.290 align:middle line:10%
There is no law that says
you have to stay here.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:27.170 align:middle line:10%
You are the one who
says, I gotta go back.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Monroe,
he died in 1995.

00:31:28.545 --> 00:31:29.345 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:31:29.345 --> 00:31:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This was the first time
I've ever seen him on video,

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and that was an
old vintage clip.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.188 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:31:35.188 --> 00:31:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he was
quite a guy, wasn't he?

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.647 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Yeah, he is
really quite a guy.

00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:41.098 align:middle line:84%
And I love the fact that he
talks about it as a load.

00:31:41.098 --> 00:31:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
really interesting,

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:90%
because we're here now.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:84%
We choose to come back,
we chose this life.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:90%
We're here, we're doing this.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.450 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing consciousness
to another group of people.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's a reason
that we're here, right?

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we haven't
figured it out yet,

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.795 align:middle line:90%
but there's a reason we're here.

00:32:00.795 --> 00:32:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well we're
moving beyond that,

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and I think that the people
that are interested in Monroe

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:10.250 align:middle line:84%
are interested in expanding
their awareness, right?

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So the science part that
you're talking about,

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.990 align:middle line:90%
there are people out there now--

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:19.490 align:middle line:84%
CEOs, bank owners, executives,
physicists themselves,

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:84%
scientists-- who are really
interested in connecting

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:26.380 align:middle line:84%
to the information,
but they're scared.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.380 align:middle line:90%
They've had an attitude.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've lived in
a materialistic world

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.880 align:middle line:84%
for a long time where
they think that you die

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:90%
and that's it and goodbye.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.750 align:middle line:84%
That this is the
ultimate reality.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.830 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
else about this,

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.100 align:middle line:84%
which is what I've
been really looking at,

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.280 align:middle line:84%
which is the idea that
this is a virtual reality,

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.770 align:middle line:90%
that reality equals information.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And these people
who are left-brain

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.120 align:middle line:90%
are being given opportunities.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.430 align:middle line:84%
They're scientists at
the Noetic Institute

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.600 align:middle line:90%
that I've worked with.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.933 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Edgar Mitchell's place.

00:32:54.933 --> 00:32:55.733 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:32:55.733 --> 00:32:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Well-- Yes.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was just with Dean
Radin this last fall,

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.890 align:middle line:90%
and Julia Mossbridge.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Dean has been
turning materialism

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.280 align:middle line:84%
on its heel for a long
time by doing experiments

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.670 align:middle line:84%
on precognition, psychic
awareness, psychic functioning,

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:90%
and telepathy.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.010 align:middle line:10%
And Julia Mossbridge, she
just came out with a book--

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:20.450 align:middle line:10%
Dean's book was "Real
Magic" that just

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.960 align:middle line:10%
came out this last year, and
Julia Mossbridge's book, which

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.597 align:middle line:10%
is "The Premonition Code--"

00:33:25.597 --> 00:33:26.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well you know them all.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, these
are people that I find--

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.558 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in
for some reason.

00:33:32.558 --> 00:33:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
giants in the field.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: They are, they are.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've been working
with Tom Campbell.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And Tom Campbell is
really helping people,

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.510 align:middle line:84%
because what he's doing
is he's offering people

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.890 align:middle line:90%
away into this world.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Those people that are
skeptical of this,

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.040 align:middle line:90%
he doesn't try and change you.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.560 align:middle line:84%
He basically is giving
us a way to grow up.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
science is really

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.820 align:middle line:84%
going to give us the
answer to what this is?

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can't tell
us about reincarnation.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.070 align:middle line:84%
They can't tell us
about life after death

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.245 align:middle line:90%
as much as they try.

00:34:09.245 --> 00:34:10.730 align:middle line:90%
They can't tell us.

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I have a
feeling that they can.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or won't?

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.889 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, there
is something about--

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:22.090 align:middle line:84%
like Tom's work, is building
a foundation of science

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:25.270 align:middle line:84%
so that the paranormal
can be spoken

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:27.778 align:middle line:90%
about in scientific terms.

00:34:27.778 --> 00:34:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well in
the old days, if you

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:33.379 align:middle line:84%
use the word "paranormal,"
you would chase them away.

00:34:33.379 --> 00:34:34.179 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Exactly.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:35.637 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
pick up-- people

00:34:35.637 --> 00:34:37.929 align:middle line:84%
that are intellectuals
don't want to pick up

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:39.310 align:middle line:90%
a book on that sort of thing.

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:42.040 align:middle line:84%
They're also resistant
to the idea of any sort

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.150 align:middle line:90%
of faith-based conversation.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.800 align:middle line:90%
But there were these languages.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.830 align:middle line:84%
George, I mean, you know about
all the ancient languages

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:53.689 align:middle line:84%
and the ideas that came
through literature.

00:34:53.689 --> 00:34:54.489 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: And also the psalms.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.830 align:middle line:84%
All of that, the experiences
that people had that

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:84%
were touching the divine
and writing about it.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.872 align:middle line:84%
So this has been going
on for a long time.

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have done a little
remote viewing in your day,

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:11.130 align:middle line:90%
haven't you?

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:12.988 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:35:12.988 --> 00:35:14.663 align:middle line:90%
We've had guests on our program.

00:35:14.663 --> 00:35:15.830 align:middle line:90%
You talk about Lyn Buchanan.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Sure.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We've had Ed Dames,
Russell Targ, Paul Smith--

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.630 align:middle line:10%
some of the best
in remote viewing.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ingo Swann in
his day when he was alive.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Oh yeah.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.265 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of remote viewing?

00:35:27.265 --> 00:35:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I think it's
the best way for the science

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.080 align:middle line:84%
community-- and also
laypeople, too, other civilians

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:40.300 align:middle line:84%
like me that we're trained in
that format to see and explore

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.790 align:middle line:84%
subconsciousness,
the unconscious

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:45.520 align:middle line:84%
part of themselves that
literally is connected

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.180 align:middle line:90%
to the information.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.460 align:middle line:90%
I think it's miraculous.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.310 align:middle line:90%
The CRV training.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:53.290 align:middle line:90%
There are various people--

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.650 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned, Dean Radin
and Julia Mossbridge,

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.840 align:middle line:90%
there's also Gail Husick--

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.100 align:middle line:84%
is basically a Harvard grad who
was trained by Lyn Buchanan.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.475 align:middle line:84%
And now she has this
whole group of CRVers

00:36:05.475 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:84%
who are accessing information
for law enforcement--

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.277 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well-educated people.

00:36:09.277 --> 00:36:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Absolutely.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:12.250 align:middle line:90%
And Linda Taggart.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.042 align:middle line:84%
My goodness, we can't
forget Linda Taggart.

00:36:14.042 --> 00:36:14.842 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:36:14.842 --> 00:36:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: I've been involved
with the Power of Eight.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking to people
all over the world in a group

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:26.200 align:middle line:84%
every Monday morning accessing
the information of what

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.870 align:middle line:84%
people are intentioning
and holding

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.970 align:middle line:90%
the intention for this group.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:32.300 align:middle line:90%
And we've been doing that--

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.970 align:middle line:84%
I had people doing
that for me while I

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:37.400 align:middle line:84%
was going around the country,
and it was incredibly helpful.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And CRV, of course,
means Controlled Remote

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Viewing.

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the ARV, which
Marty Rosenblatt is using--

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which stands for?

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: The Associate
Remote Viewing.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or Advanced
Remote Viewing.

00:36:48.315 --> 00:36:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: You could
say that, too,

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:55.805 align:middle line:84%
which is basically bringing
to the present the future.

00:36:55.805 --> 00:36:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.388 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: And that's
what we've been doing

00:36:58.388 --> 00:37:00.010 align:middle line:90%
when we are betting in Vegas.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:03.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, the APP, the
Applied Precognition Program,

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Marty's been doing-- that's how
I met Dean and Julia, watching

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.830 align:middle line:84%
them, listening
to them-- they're

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:12.950 align:middle line:84%
incredible people to interview
and get their ideas about this.

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:14.500 align:middle line:84%
But these are
science-based people.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
experimented in Vegas?

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes!

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it work for you?

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes, it does.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.137 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've had a guest
on "Coast to Coast,"

00:37:21.137 --> 00:37:22.000 align:middle line:10%
Joseph Gallenberger.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.300 align:middle line:10%
>>FREES: Of course, I love Joe.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So he's written a
book called "Liquid Luck."

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:26.030 align:middle line:10%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He has taken
students to Las Vegas

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:30.740 align:middle line:10%
in two separate groups.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.730 align:middle line:84%
One group, they're
upbeat, they're psychic,

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:90%
they're into this.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.840 align:middle line:84%
The other group-- and he
selects it on purpose--

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.370 align:middle line:90%
they're unhappy.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:41.860 align:middle line:90%
They're just not into it.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Time and time again,
the happy group wins.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: I love that.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does this happen?

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, it's a desire.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a desire to be curious.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It's that whole-- it's the whole
thing about being skeptical.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.250 align:middle line:84%
If you're skeptical,
you are going

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:84%
to find every conceivable
piece of evidence

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.560 align:middle line:90%
to support your idea.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Also, I did
my old experiment.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.500 align:middle line:84%
After I interviewed
Gallenberger, read his book,

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.290 align:middle line:84%
I went, I'm going to go
to Vegas and test this.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Mm-hmm.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because this
is too unbelievable.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he would
talk about sitting

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:21.430 align:middle line:84%
at a slot machine thinking
positive thoughts,

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and he'd get a royal flush
or something like that

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:26.950 align:middle line:90%
and go crazy.

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So I went and I experimented
on two separate days.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Day number one, bad attitude.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Just don't get into things.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Try to make yourself unhappy.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.419 align:middle line:84%
That's not fun, by the
way, and it's not easy.

00:38:42.419 --> 00:38:43.219 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES:

00:38:43.219 --> 00:38:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I lost.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Oh.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The next day,
I changed everything.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.900 align:middle line:90%
My attitude, the works.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Its intention.

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.910 align:middle line:90%
It's very curious.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that this larger
consciousness system really

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:03.140 align:middle line:84%
responds to a loving,
heart-centered intention.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It works.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.965 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: It did, and it does.

00:39:05.965 --> 00:39:07.300 align:middle line:90%
That's fabulous, I love that.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you go into
it negatively, down,

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.270 align:middle line:84%
even though you're
human, and you're

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.870 align:middle line:84%
going to have your
ups and downs,

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:19.640 align:middle line:84%
but if you go into things that
way, it's not going to happen.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.020 align:middle line:84%
But if you change
your attitude--

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --it's dramatic.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it happen now
time and time again.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: I think that's
why I do the work I do.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.253 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm happy and I have
intention to help others.

00:39:31.253 --> 00:39:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you
mentioned Tom Campbell.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about him.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Wow.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, I started seeing
him in this very odd way.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I heard about him and I went
to one of those conferences,

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and my head started
hurting because I'm just

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.760 align:middle line:84%
not science-minded in that
way, but it was curious.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.890 align:middle line:90%
And I was very interested.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.710 align:middle line:84%
"My Big Toe," his
book, that dynamic--

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:57.610 align:middle line:84%
is not "my" meaning
his, it's everyone's.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And he's all about
helping people grow up--

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.550 align:middle line:84%
not making them do
it, but including them

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.190 align:middle line:84%
in this incredible book
which blends physics

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:07.420 align:middle line:90%
with metaphysics.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So then I started exploring more
of this virtual reality idea,

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.460 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's a physicist.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Yes, he's a physicist,
but he's also the consciousness

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.030 align:middle line:90%
expert.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:19.240 align:middle line:84%
He basically did
his thesis work,

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and then he went off and
started working with Bob Monroe.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So he became a consciousness
explorer at the same time

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:30.020 align:middle line:84%
that he was starting
to be a NASA physicist.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So he's basically been offering
left-brained people this

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.070 align:middle line:90%
wonderful opportunity--

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and I just came back
from England two weeks

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.750 align:middle line:84%
of his immersives,
which are basically

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:48.310 align:middle line:84%
these very structured days of
going into his binaural beats

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.140 align:middle line:84%
that he developed
with Dennis Mennerich,

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.470 align:middle line:84%
the same guy that was developing
the Hemi-Sync program back

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:54.910 align:middle line:90%
with Bob Monroe.

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:57.160 align:middle line:84%
They developed these
Hemi-Sync program--

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.830 align:middle line:84%
excuse me, his
own binaural beats

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:02.290 align:middle line:84%
that basically give
people an opportunity

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:06.910 align:middle line:84%
in a very controlled environment
with these immersives

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to access altered
states of consciousness.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.440 align:middle line:90%
These are left-brained people.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.660 align:middle line:90%
He's giving them an inroad.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So think of what
this can do, George.

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Think of what it can do to all
the people that run our world.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The people with all
the money, the people

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:25.480 align:middle line:84%
that are executives, the
people that own businesses.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.750 align:middle line:84%
If they can have their own
personal experience doing

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.300 align:middle line:84%
things like I do,
accessing deceased

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.880 align:middle line:84%
loved ones, having
past life regressions,

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.812 align:middle line:84%
going into future
probable databases

00:41:35.812 --> 00:41:37.020 align:middle line:90%
and pulling information out--

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.103 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Winning in Vegas.

00:41:38.103 --> 00:41:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Winning in Vegas.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.317 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe.

00:41:40.317 --> 00:41:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bi-attitude

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Bi-attitude?

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't say maybe.

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.912 align:middle line:84%
You say maybe, it's
not going to happen.

00:41:43.912 --> 00:41:45.912 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: [LAUGHS] Well,
you're right about that.

00:41:45.912 --> 00:41:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But the dynamic is, it's
accessing information.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.420 align:middle line:90%
People were going in there and--

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:55.160 align:middle line:84%
it's one thing-- it's one thing
to have my own experiences,

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:55.960 align:middle line:90%
which I did.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I accessed
grandparents that I never met.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.430 align:middle line:84%
That was deeply emotional,
because my question

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:04.930 align:middle line:84%
to the larger
consciousness system

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.930 align:middle line:84%
was, could you please
show me something

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:11.200 align:middle line:84%
that would be helpful for
me in this physical realm

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and someone that is not
in the physical realm

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and see if there could be
some sort of communication.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, I saw grandparents
that I'd never met before,

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:23.300 align:middle line:84%
that were dead many years
before I'd even been born.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But it was great to
have my own experiences,

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:84%
but to see these
science-based people,

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:34.420 align:middle line:84%
these bank owners stand
up and say, oh my God,

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I just came in contact with
someone that had died years ago

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:41.660 align:middle line:84%
that I had no idea that they
were even able to communicate,

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.735 align:middle line:90%
and that's what happened.

00:42:42.735 --> 00:42:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom
Campbell, of course,

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:47.080 align:middle line:84%
talked a little bit about
what happens when we die

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.620 align:middle line:90%
in the documentary "The Path."

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS CAMPBELL: So you have
these different reality frames.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.870 align:middle line:84%
When you die, you go into
a reality frame that's

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.210 align:middle line:84%
not the same as the
dreaming, it's not the same

00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:59.560 align:middle line:90%
as really the out-of-body.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.520 align:middle line:84%
You go into this reality
frame that was made especially

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.970 align:middle line:84%
for people who are just
transitioning from this reality

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:09.730 align:middle line:84%
frame to another, because these
people have special needs.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.900 align:middle line:90%
They're very confused.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:15.340 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what's going
on, because when you're here,

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.150 align:middle line:90%
you're just here.

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Physical, that's it.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:22.060 align:middle line:84%
You're not aware of this
other dimension to your being.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So you die and suddenly you're
someplace else, you know?

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like going to
sleep in your bed

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and waking up in a foreign
country, in a strange house.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:32.960 align:middle line:84%
It's that kind of a
thing, so you're tend

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:37.250 align:middle line:84%
to be a little stressed and
a little confused as to,

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.000 align:middle line:84%
where am I, what's
going on, what do I do?

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So they have this reality frame
that caters to that transition.

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And in that reality frame,
you may be met by loved ones,

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.480 align:middle line:84%
you may have all
the things going on,

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.730 align:middle line:90%
but again, that's all virtual.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It seems real enough,
but it's all virtual.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:05.370 align:middle line:84%
You get taken to almost
like group sessions where

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:07.830 align:middle line:90%
things are explained to you.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're not explained to you
because in a way that tells you

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.000 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is
digital and it's--

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.970 align:middle line:84%
it is-- they're not explaining
to you that sort of thing.

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:19.470 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
tell you something

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:20.970 align:middle line:90%
that makes you feel better.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:27.270 align:middle line:84%
That lets you relax, that
lets you get the idea

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:31.490 align:middle line:84%
that now you're aware in this
different reality system.

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:32.290 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And they use any trick that
they can to get you to do that.

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a very strong
belief system this way,

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.270 align:middle line:84%
that belief system will become
a hook by which they will

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:45.910 align:middle line:84%
manipulate you to get you to
relax and let go and go on,

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:46.710 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you really want to see
Uncle Fred or your child that

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:56.020 align:middle line:84%
died or things like that,
well that'll happen, too.

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.130 align:middle line:90%
But that's all virtual.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not really what
you think it is.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just part of
a reality frame

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:06.832 align:middle line:84%
that helps you make this
transition to a bigger picture.

00:45:06.832 --> 00:45:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Once you've made that
frame to a bigger picture

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and you kind of have the
idea, the next thing you do

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.880 align:middle line:90%
is say, well what's next?

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.048 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go from here?

00:45:14.048 --> 00:45:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's pretty
compelling, isn't he, Marla?

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Yeah, he is, and
the dynamic of understanding

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.500 align:middle line:84%
that it's databases,
it sort of takes

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.900 align:middle line:90%
all of the woo-woo out of it.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But in my experience
doing this work,

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:31.140 align:middle line:84%
it is so benevolent
and so incredible--

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:34.500 align:middle line:84%
he talks about Uncle Fred,
that it's not just Uncle Fred,

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.920 align:middle line:84%
but this larger consciousness
system in the reality

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.370 align:middle line:84%
frame of Uncle Fred gives
emotion, feeling, data

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:46.830 align:middle line:84%
of past experiences in the
present moment and even

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.130 align:middle line:84%
future information
which makes us

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:51.930 align:middle line:84%
connect to the
love, which is all

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:53.910 align:middle line:90%
about lowering the entropy--

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:84%
the chaos that we're
experiencing into something

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.563 align:middle line:84%
this fundamental that we can
understand, which is love.

00:46:00.563 --> 00:46:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you mentioned
you went to Europe.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there a
program you were in?

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Yes, it was
the immersive, the--

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:06.890 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:08.430 align:middle line:90%
It's Tom Campbell's immersives.

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And we were at the Lumley
Castle outside of Durham,

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.410 align:middle line:90%
and this castle was incredible.

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:15.780 align:middle line:90%
And we were there--

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.750 align:middle line:84%
there were two different groups
that we did, almost 100 people

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.890 align:middle line:90%
in each group.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And we had ongoing sessions
where we would come and talk

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.440 align:middle line:84%
to Tom, we would go and do
a binaural beat example.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And some of those binaural beats
that he and Dennis developed

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.820 align:middle line:84%
gave my corpus callosum
some interesting experiences

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.740 align:middle line:90%
that I had never had before.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.040 align:middle line:84%
My remote viewing
skills kicked in,

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and I started asking,
OK, so I'm seeing

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.740 align:middle line:90%
my target from this position.

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Flip it, and I drew it that way.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Show me this, give
me the colors.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Detail after detail, some
of the best remote viewing

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I've ever done.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that was
really exciting for me

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.910 align:middle line:90%
is the healing aspects, George.

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:03.530 align:middle line:84%
The health of intentioning
with this larger consciousness

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:04.330 align:middle line:90%
system--

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:05.538 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --heal other people?

00:47:05.538 --> 00:47:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: That's all we did.

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:07.470 align:middle line:90%
We-- I mean--

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they sick?

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, they
all had maladies.

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't-- all we got
was the first name and a last

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:15.810 align:middle line:90%
initial.

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And we had these forms
that we would draw--

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.010 align:middle line:90%
I drew like gingerbread men--

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and do the diagnosis,
and that's easy for me.

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Psychically I can often see
things in people's bodies,

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.220 align:middle line:84%
but it was really
the healing aspect.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.400 align:middle line:84%
All of us together, we were on
different parts of the castle,

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.660 align:middle line:84%
but all of us focused
in on removing

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:41.285 align:middle line:84%
the dark spots or the
things that we saw in that--

00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have to
see the person physically?

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: No, not at all.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we just used the
model of-- it was of a form--

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:52.170 align:middle line:84%
or I drew gingerbread
men so that I could just

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:55.200 align:middle line:84%
get what it was
without spending time,

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.060 align:middle line:84%
detail the head and
neck, et cetera.

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.750 align:middle line:90%
I just was led to information.

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But it was really the healing
aspect that was most important.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.890 align:middle line:90%
So here we've got these--

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Think
about this, George.

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:11.490 align:middle line:84%
We've got scientists,
physicists, bank owners, CEOs,

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:15.840 align:middle line:84%
people of high intelligence
that are running things

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.102 align:middle line:84%
all around the world coming
in and doing this work.

00:48:19.102 --> 00:48:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
in this program?

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.518 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes they were.

00:48:21.518 --> 00:48:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when the program
was done, how did they feel?

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, dramatic.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.410 align:middle line:10%
Dramatic experiences
happened when

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:36.640 align:middle line:10%
they were able to access a past
life and see different things.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was an opportunity
for me where I saw an Algonquin

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Indian and I was told, this is
a man who shot you in the back

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:44.820 align:middle line:90%
with an arrow.

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And I went through that
whole process as a young boy.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: And I had--

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --past
life if no doubt.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Had a lingering
problem with my back.

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:57.060 align:middle line:84%
But my information that
day was, I asked for it.

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want to know something
that's stuck in my body

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.840 align:middle line:90%
from a previous lifetime.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And we were all doing
the same exercises.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So there were
business executives

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:10.180 align:middle line:84%
that were accessing various
levels of consciousness.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.310 align:middle line:90%
So they've shifted.

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a
while to integrate.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:18.450 align:middle line:84%
This immersive experience
is really intense,

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:19.890 align:middle line:90%
but it's making a difference.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is Tom
Campbell's initial thrust here?

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.750 align:middle line:84%
What does he want everybody
to come away with?

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.792 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I think he
wants to help everybody

00:49:26.792 --> 00:49:28.270 align:middle line:90%
to grow up on some level.

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:34.320 align:middle line:84%
To stop having the
ego-intensive materialistic idea

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.230 align:middle line:84%
of something, and
to basically see

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that there is a way in to the
consciousness of something

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.060 align:middle line:90%
bigger.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.810 align:middle line:90%
There is something bigger.

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:47.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not about owning God.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not about it's just the
Presbyterians or the Baptists.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:55.080 align:middle line:84%
It literally is information
accessible to all

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:59.220 align:middle line:84%
of us that is benevolent
and helps us on our journey.

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.930 align:middle line:10%
It makes us feel connected.

00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:05.010 align:middle line:10%
And most of us understand
that it's not just you die

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:06.150 align:middle line:10%
and that's it.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:09.210 align:middle line:10%
We know that there's a
larger consciousness system.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I got immersed in it by
the trauma of my childhood

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:14.920 align:middle line:90%
and praying and asking for help.

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.220 align:middle line:90%
I was getting it.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if on
your epitaph one day,

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.270 align:middle line:84%
if someone were to read it,
what would you like it to say?

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:26.830 align:middle line:90%


00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:28.355 align:middle line:10%
Here lies Marla Frees.

00:50:28.355 --> 00:50:30.730 align:middle line:10%
>>FREES: Well, I don't think
I'm going to be lying there.

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:33.800 align:middle line:10%
I think I'm going to choose
a different method of that.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But I think the dynamic is,
she came here to assist others.

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.350 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And made the
world a difference.

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: I think so.

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:48.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, some of the
things that I'm doing now,

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at I never
in my wildest imagination

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:52.910 align:middle line:90%
thought I would be doing.

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:55.450 align:middle line:10%
I never thought I'd be sitting
with a bunch of scientists

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:58.750 align:middle line:10%
from all over the
world looking at this

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:00.580 align:middle line:10%
and listening to
them as they tell me

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:03.027 align:middle line:10%
their intense experiences
from accessing

00:51:03.027 --> 00:51:04.360 align:middle line:10%
altered states of consciousness.

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.818 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did they
become believers?

00:51:05.818 --> 00:51:08.770 align:middle line:10%
These scientists who probably
were skeptics in the beginning?

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:11.395 align:middle line:10%
>>FREES: Well I think that they
were skeptics in the beginning,

00:51:11.395 --> 00:51:14.830 align:middle line:10%
but after 400 and some hours
on YouTube of Tom's videos

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:18.460 align:middle line:10%
and following the
virtual reality model,

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:20.020 align:middle line:10%
they started to
think about this.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just
Tom that is talking

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:26.240 align:middle line:84%
about this virtual reality,
it is other scientists

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.865 align:middle line:84%
who are bringing this
to the forefront.

00:51:27.865 --> 00:51:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to say, we
need a hundred Tom Campbells.

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, we do, and I
think that that's what Tom--

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly what Tom's
leaving as a legacy.

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:40.473 align:middle line:84%
He continues to do this
all over the world.

00:51:40.473 --> 00:51:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marla, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.765 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Thank you, George.

00:51:43.765 --> 00:51:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it amazing
when you can combine science

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:48.400 align:middle line:90%
and the psychic realm together?

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.660 align:middle line:90%
It really does work.

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, thanks for
watching "Beyond Belief."
