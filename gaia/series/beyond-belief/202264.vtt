>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.107 align:middle line:10%
Let me tell you about
our special guest.

00:00:28.107 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:10%
Sonia Barrett is well known
for her cutting-edge insights

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:10%
into her work, which bridges
the gap between science

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.550 align:middle line:10%
and spirituality.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.590 align:middle line:84%
She is the executive producer of
the award winning documentary,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:90%
"The Business of Disease."

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Also, a noted author of
"The Holographic Canvas."

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.668 align:middle line:84%
Sonia, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:45.668 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SONIA BARRETT: Well, thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in this field?

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Well, you know what?

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Curiosity, questioning.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.457 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Killed the cat.

00:00:56.457 --> 00:00:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: [LAUGHS]
Well, here I am.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:10%
But yes, curiosity coming from
a religious background, which

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:10%
is very interesting, to
come from that standpoint.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:10%
And then many years later,
decide to ask a question as

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:10%
to what is this life?

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So I was going
through a divorce.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And I had to question,
well, what did I just live?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's what happened.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Then I just dived in with
absolutely no experience,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
not being able to meditate, no
background whatsoever, to dive

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.258 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
how I got started.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you cover
this gap between science

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality in a very
interesting way, don't you?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Yes.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I
approach everything

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:84%
based on my own journey,
my own discoveries,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
which sort of started
with not reading anything.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I think I looked at
two or three books

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and decided that
there had to be a way

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
to find out more about what
this was without any books.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.860 align:middle line:90%
And I did know about workshops.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know about metaphysics.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know about
quantum physics.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:90%
You're self-taught.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.419 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: I was.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really how
I came at all of this

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and had to teach
myself how to meditate

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and had some major
breakthroughs.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And so now, it helps me
to tell other people that

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:90%
is very possible.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.180 align:middle line:84%
It is our birthright to
be able to ask questions

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:90%
and to dive in.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This planet
right now seems

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:84%
to be having an amazing
amount of chaos.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be out of control.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
How do we cope with
something like that?

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, that's
a very big question

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.580 align:middle line:90%
because there's so many layers.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's the trick here.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with
a lot of layers.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So when we say, how do we
cope with something like that?

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:84%
There are people who are
looking at things from one

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:90%
particular perspective.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:84%
We have two different
sides here, basically,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.690 align:middle line:90%
in dealing with this.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on that person
and where they're coming from

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and their perception
of what's going on.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Some people have bought
completely into the fear,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and they're living
in that space.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
other people who

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.220 align:middle line:84%
are stressed because they're
encountering people who

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:90%
are so invested in the fear.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:90%
So you see what I'm saying?

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: There's two different
situations here in terms

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.840 align:middle line:90%
of how we would deal with that.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
If you're not
invested in the fear,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
then you have to find a
way to be able to step back

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and to find some centeredness,
and some balance,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and to recognize why people
are so heavily invested

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:90%
in the fear.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.268 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got a friend
in St. Louis, Sonia,

00:03:48.268 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:90%
who is afraid of everything.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:84%
This guy will send
me video clips

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:84%
of every bizarre thing
he stumbles across,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.520 align:middle line:90%
but he believes everything.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:90%
And I keep telling him--

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I said, you've
got to be careful.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't believe
all this stuff.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:84%
There might be a little piece
of truth to some of it in there,

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:84%
but you just can't
believe it blanketly.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:84%
But the media doesn't do a
very good job explaining stuff

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: No.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:84%
The media actually
supports the fear.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the challenge
that we're facing.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream media, I would
say, is perpetuating it.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:90%
They are adding to it.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:84%
They are running stories,
which is precisely that.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.737 align:middle line:84%
They're running stories
as if it were a movie.

00:04:35.737 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:90%
And people are heavily invested.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ratings, ratings.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the
news that comes on,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:90%
what, several times a day?

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: There are
people that are addicted.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.635 align:middle line:90%
They are hooked on the news.

00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All these
cable networks

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.968 align:middle line:90%
that are on constantly.

00:04:49.968 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Yes, yes, absolutely.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But people are invested, and
that's what we have to realize.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
It's no different than somebody
being hooked on something.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:90%
A drug, food, or whatever.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:84%
After a while of being
locked in the house

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.720 align:middle line:84%
like that,
particularly right now,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and they're watching this day
in, day out, all day long,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's their
reality at this point.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So they're believing
everything that's being said.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
challenge that's

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:84%
being faced right now
with mainstream media

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:90%
and what they're offering.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.435 align:middle line:90%
Not solutions.

00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
an agenda, Sonia,

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:90%
to pollute our minds worldwide?

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, again,
another interesting question

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
because I think that the agenda
has always really been there.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
I think we're just in a
different stage of behavior.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
We're in a different stage
right now on the planet.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But absolutely because
it serves a purpose.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
When you have people
in fear in this manner,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.220 align:middle line:84%
it's easier to want
to control people.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever the
agenda is behind that,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:84%
it's working in the sense
that the majority of people

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:90%
seem to be invested in the fear.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they're in fear,
they want to be controlled.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
begging for help.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: That's right.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:84%
They're looking forward
to somebody else

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.250 align:middle line:84%
making these decisions,
coming up with solutions.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we see.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the savior program
running once again.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
We are going to
fix this for you.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Just do what we tell you to do.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're seeing.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So people are very
invested in, well,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.850 align:middle line:84%
what did they say that
we should do today?

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:90%
What should we do?

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the system
has them at that point

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.980 align:middle line:90%
because what's being sold?

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Death.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what's being
sold right now.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And fear.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.568 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Death and,
well, the fear and death,

00:06:45.568 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:90%
they're together.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.830 align:middle line:90%
People fear dying.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:90%
And it is our core fear.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
All human beings
have this core fear

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
of not existing,
of annihilation.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And so where would
you then tackle

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:84%
somebody for that
kind of control

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:84%
but to hit them in the one spot
that all human beings fear,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.690 align:middle line:84%
not existing, their
life force being cut.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we're seeing right now.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, death is
being sold to people.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you see when
people step away from you,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:84%
maybe, in the
supermarket in fear.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They run away.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: That's right.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid that
they might do something

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.680 align:middle line:84%
that would affect them in a way
that would interrupt their life

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:90%
flow.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember
the movie "The Matrix"?

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.473 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Oh, absolutely.

00:07:36.473 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
living like that?

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.857 align:middle line:90%
Are we in a matrix?

00:07:39.857 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Oh, absolutely.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what is a matrix?

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a system.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a construct.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So I like to say that
we are in a matrix.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the universe
or the planet, it's a system.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a system.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a construct that operates
by a specific set of rules

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:90%
and conditions.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:90%
And so we can look at a city.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.600 align:middle line:90%
A city is its own unique matrix.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why you go from
one city to the next,

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.900 align:middle line:84%
you can literally
feel that there's

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:84%
a difference in each
town that you go to.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So we have all these little
systems, and bigger systems,

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:90%
and so on, but we are.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective of the
movie, from that standpoint,

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.950 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:90%
From what it was--

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No question about it.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
dealing with right now.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's like everybody
is sort of hooked up

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.080 align:middle line:90%
to some sort of network.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.020 align:middle line:84%
A network, in this
case, a network of fear,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:84%
a network of a particular
belief that's being sold.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
people that are probably

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
considered the outcasts,
maybe like myself, looking

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:90%
on and going, wait a second.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So you've got two different sets
of people starting to operate.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
been division,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
but the division is greater
at this time simply because

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:84%
of this level of fear
that we're dealing with.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gregg Braden, a
period on a Gaia program

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:84%
called "Missing Links,"
talked about the matrix.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Mm-hmm.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: The
feel that connects

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
all things, the web, the
net, Planck's matrix,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:90%
the divine matrix.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:27.090 align:middle line:84%
This field, it is the
release of energy itself.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Where did the field come from?

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, it depends
on who you talk to.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.180 align:middle line:90%
The ancient Vedas, for example.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Over 7,000 years
before present, they

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.970 align:middle line:84%
offer us a clue
that's not in science.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.360 align:middle line:84%
But they describe a time
before the beginning

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.860 align:middle line:84%
when what they call is
Brahman, "The unborn in whom

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.990 align:middle line:90%
all existing things abide."

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:84%
"The one manifesting
as the many,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.210 align:middle line:90%
the formless putting on forms."

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:10%
This is the way the Rigveda
describes this primal energy

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:10%
that is happening as
this release of energy

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:10%
that we call the Big Bang.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So what we're finding
is that the field that

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
fills the empty space, this
96% of the universe that

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:84%
is believed to be missing,
it's not missing at all.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.720 align:middle line:84%
It is a form of energy
that's been with us

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.581 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I think
this is so important.

00:10:19.581 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.890 align:middle line:10%
And cosmologists at the
University of California

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:10%
in Santa Cruz agrees.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:10%
What he says is that "the Big
Bang did not occur somewhere

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:10%
in space, but it occupied
the whole of space."

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.867 align:middle line:10%
"The Big Bang was
space itself, bursting

00:10:37.867 --> 00:10:39.450 align:middle line:10%
into a new kind of
energy," and that's

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:10%
the end of the quote from him.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:10%
So with these ideas
in mind, let's go back

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:10%
to that twin photon experiment.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.710 align:middle line:10%
What really happened?

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:10%
Two photons, 14
miles apart, having

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:10%
exactly the same experience
at exactly the same period

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:10%
of time.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:10%
How did the information
get from one to the other?

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a trick question
because now we know it didn't.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.620 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have to get
from one to the other

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:84%
because the information
was already there.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:90%
And this is the point.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:90%
This is the controversy.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:90%
This is the mystery.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:90%
It didn't need to travel at all.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:90%
It was already present.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.850 align:middle line:84%
The experiment is telling
us that we are still

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:84%
connected to people
and places, no matter

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.590 align:middle line:84%
where in the universe, where
on the planet they may be.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And once we
understand that connection,

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.837 align:middle line:84%
can we do remarkable
things as human beings?

00:11:26.837 --> 00:11:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Oh, absolutely.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And the flip side
of all of this is

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that it's an opportunity
for us to enter

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.610 align:middle line:84%
into what I call our super-self,
our supernatural self.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So everything that Gregg
Braden is speaking about

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
is definitely showing
that that possibility

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.260 align:middle line:84%
exists for us to
step into a more

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.190 align:middle line:90%
expansive level of operating.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
what we're seeing today

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:84%
with people that
seem to be completely

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
separate from this
kind of understanding

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and those people who are
saying, wait a minute.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:90%
There is more.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So it is definitely a
time of opportunity.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So despite how it looks,
it's an opportunity

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:90%
for evolution for an expansion.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'd also like to say
that this thing that we need

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:84%
to understand or to
remember is that nature

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:84%
operates in a way of what
I call a default evolution.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
when we are not

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:84%
expanding or evolving-- say that
collectively the human race is

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:84%
not, I think it
automatically starts

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:84%
a process of helping to create
an expansion in the collective,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:90%
in the species, and in general.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we're also
looking at this up-stir,

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:84%
this upgrade process
that's happening.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And we can also
see with technology

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:84%
that this is so because we don't
view the body as technology.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't view the construct
as some incredible level

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:90%
of technology.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do here
in terms of technology

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
is mimicking a bigger
construct, a system

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that really is something
that you can't describe.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But it is a different level
and a different understanding

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
of technology, and that's
what we're doing right now.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:84%
We have the opportunity
to step into

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:90%
these supernatural abilities.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonia, what
is default evolution?

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Well--

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: A
default evolution is

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
what I was explaining,
the fact that nature

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:84%
finds a way to initiate through
the various cycles, right?

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Because in this life, in
this reality as we know it,

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.760 align:middle line:90%
it's all cycles.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:90%
We have our day and night cycle.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:90%
We have our 24-hour cycle.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:59.330 align:middle line:84%
We have our year-long
cycle, 365 days.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:84%
All of that
ultimately, in the end,

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:84%
comes out to these bigger cycles
that we've heard of, these

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
26,000-year cycles, these
great cycles, and so on.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's a lot of--

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's a pattern.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: There's a pattern.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And after so many
of these cycles,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:21.290 align:middle line:84%
there are moments of great
expansion that need to happen,

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.490 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
we are right now.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of
this default process

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.630 align:middle line:84%
of helping to shift
consciousness,

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:90%
despite how things appear.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't mean that
everybody is suddenly

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.935 align:middle line:84%
going to be in the same
state of awareness.

00:14:35.935 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Because when I
say consciousness,

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking of awareness,
different levels of awareness.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:47.990 align:middle line:84%
We have an opportunity, however,
to expand our awareness,

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:90%
our consciousness.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Some maybe not as
much, but for others

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:84%
who are in a deeper
state of awareness,

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
to continue the expansion
of that journey.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.110 align:middle line:90%
So that's the default process.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:90%
You don't do it naturally.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Nature naturally
starts to shift us.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're seeing,
and it stirs up everything.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.602 align:middle line:90%
It's chaos right now.

00:15:10.602 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's huge.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Good,
bad, and indifferent.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: That's right.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
talk about what's

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:90%
going on in the universe.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
The structure of
time/space, which

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
is a Gaia television
program, of course,

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:84%
talks about the Cycle of
Yuga right around this.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.908 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:15:26.908 --> 00:15:29.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: The Hindus offer
us probably the most exacting

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:10%
of all the prophetic
systems of time.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:10%
It's called the Cycles of Yugas.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.730 align:middle line:10%
Many people have heard of
what is called the Kali

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.770 align:middle line:10%
Yuga, in which we
are purportedly

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:10%
well-established with
our modern society.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.060 align:middle line:10%
To understand the
Yuga principle,

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.800 align:middle line:10%
we have to acknowledge a certain
experience in our own organism,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:10%
that there are phases in the
development of our organism

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.170 align:middle line:10%
which are inherent
in and associated

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:10%
with a certain passage of time.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:10%
For example, we reach
seven years of age

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:10%
and our teeth fall out,
and we get new teeth.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:10%
We have nothing
to say about that.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:10%
And by another seven
years, suddenly,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:10%
we have completely reorganized
our pelvic region or glandular

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:10%
secretions, and we
are now in puberty

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:10%
and have achieved sexual
reproductive capacities.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:84%
The changes just seem to
occur in the nature of time.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a kind of genesis,
a process of maturation.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
elimination through death

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:84%
that we have nothing
to say about.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus extended this
cyclic phase to everything

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.090 align:middle line:84%
They said that
everything is inherently

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:90%
dominated and created by time.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's that
all mean, Sonia?

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean to us?

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, it's
what I was saying

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
in talking about cycles
because this is something

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:90%
that we really don't look at.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:90%
We are so accustomed to--

00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:84%
while we're turning 7, as he
mentioned, we're turning 13,

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:84%
we're turning
these various ages,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:84%
but it's evident that we have
to be networked into something.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Something is keeping
track of our process then,

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
our maturity, our
puberty, right?

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.609 align:middle line:90%
That it naturally happens--

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Naturally.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: --at a certain age.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Right, so all of--

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
a clock behind it.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.377 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:17:22.377 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:84%
So there is this clock,
the cyclic system

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:90%
that we are somehow wired into.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Is it our brains
that's wired into it?

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:90%
It's the sensory system.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I like to say it's
a sensory system.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
The brain, of course,
is part of that.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But the body is really
this technology,

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:84%
this sensory system
that processes

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:90%
emotions and feelings.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:84%
It's completely
networked or set up then

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.930 align:middle line:84%
took to process
everything that we

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.710 align:middle line:90%
will experience in this life.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.110 align:middle line:90%
This is the technology.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Who we are is
beyond the body, not

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:90%
that we're lessening the body.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:90%
It has its purpose.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
But who we are is beyond that.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're simply
utilizing the vehicle

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:84%
to operate in this
zone, in this field.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And specifically, we're
talking about the Earth field.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's designed in a way
to process the gaseous laws,

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to operate in the
gaseous laws here.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important for us

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%
to really recognize it from
a level of this advanced--

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:84%
to say advance doesn't
even do it justice--

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:84%
level of technology
in terms of how

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
this vehicle and this
vessel is designed.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And he mentioned the
aging and the dying.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And the way I look at
this as is the fact

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot that we
don't understand, simply

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:84%
because we are so programmed
to see reality as this one

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.650 align:middle line:90%
particular version of reality.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's a version
of reality that's

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:84%
prescribed for us to operate by,
to live by from birth to death.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But my question way back when
and now is, but is there more?

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Is there a possibility of
going beyond those boundaries?

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.235 align:middle line:84%
Are they simply boundaries,
what we understand?

00:19:18.235 --> 00:19:19.613 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some
people can do that.

00:19:19.613 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.285 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Others can't.

00:19:22.285 --> 00:19:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Why is it
that others can't?

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this
moment is so important,

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.750 align:middle line:84%
that we start to open up to
realizing that there really

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:90%
are no boundaries.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:90%
There really are no limitations.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.990 align:middle line:84%
What we are up against
is programming,

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
a lot of programming that
have been there for probably

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.450 align:middle line:90%
Who knows how long?

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's all now
part of our genetics.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.340 align:middle line:90%
It's all part of our bodies.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.800 align:middle line:84%
It can all be
shifted, but it can't

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
shift until one comes
into a realization

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
of a deep questioning, to
give permission to our brain

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and to the expansive part
of us to say, wait a second.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:90%
We want more.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:84%
We want to go beyond this
prescribed version of reality,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.390 align:middle line:84%
of aging, of dying, of
all of those things.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you started
using this for your own life,

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.932 align:middle line:90%
how did that change you?

00:20:17.932 --> 00:20:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: It's been a
gradual process because you're

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:90%
constantly expanding.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.980 align:middle line:10%
So it's not a final awareness.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:10%
It's every new awareness
that I came into,

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.510 align:middle line:10%
every new questioning.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.750 align:middle line:84%
All it did was push me
further into deeper levels

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:90%
of curiosity.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, what
I find is that it

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.140 align:middle line:84%
makes me look at reality
completely differently

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of it
being more of a game.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Being alive being part
of this experience,

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:90%
it's more of a game.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:84%
This is how we learn to
design games and create games.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:90%
Being a human being is a game.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:90%
It's an opportunity.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
opportunity, like all games,

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:90%
to figure it out.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:90%
Is there an outcome?

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Is there a final outcome?

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Or is it as we've
been programmed

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:84%
to believe, that
you're born, you

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.170 align:middle line:84%
go through this
process of puberty.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
You have children, you do
this, and then you die.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is
more to it than that,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's the conclusion
that I came to.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:90%
I started to realize--

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:90%
I thought, well, no.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.942 align:middle line:90%
Where did all this come from?

00:21:33.942 --> 00:21:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Where did all this come from?

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're sort of
inundated with programs

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:84%
going so far back that nobody
really knows, well, when did

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:90%
we start being this program?

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Where did this all come from?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's been my questioning.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And it just continues to
lead me down the rabbit

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:84%
hole of discoveries, and
there is no going back.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's hear
from David Icke,

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
who's on a new Gaia program
called "Escape the Matrix,"

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:84%
who talks about the people
who have this ability and who

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:90%
don't.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:07.390 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID ICKE: What if
they had the knowledge

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:10%
that if they can manipulate
your brain to decode reality

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:22.890 align:middle line:10%
in a certain way, they could
ensure by that manipulation

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:10%
that you created,
thus experienced,

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:10%
thus believed in a
reality that suited them,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.290 align:middle line:10%
even if it didn't suit you?

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:10%


00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:10%
And that is what
we're looking at.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.730 align:middle line:10%
We're looking at a human society
that has been systematically

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:10%
structured to keep the
truth about reality from us.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:10%
So we are living the
illusion of a physical world

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:10%
with all its sense
of limitation.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.305 align:middle line:10%
And I can't, and
it's not possible.

00:22:55.305 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:10%


00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:10%
While from the shadows,
our perceptions

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.150 align:middle line:10%
are being manipulated
and imposed.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.750 align:middle line:10%
Those perceptions
then dictate how

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.670 align:middle line:10%
the brain decodes
that information

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.790 align:middle line:10%
that we're receiving into a
reality that we experience.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:10%
So for instance,
the more you can

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.180 align:middle line:10%
persuade people they're
little me and have no power,

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:10%
the more they will live little
me, I have no power lives

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:36.990 align:middle line:10%
and thus be no problem
to the prevailing order

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.702 align:middle line:10%
and the prevailing authority.

00:23:39.702 --> 00:23:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's what's
happening right now.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:42.577 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:23:42.577 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what's
happening right now.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
brain is, as he said,

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:52.170 align:middle line:84%
is taking its cue from the
perception and the belief

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:84%
So the perception
and belief system

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.050 align:middle line:90%
are working hand in hand.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And if your perception is
very narrow, then of course,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.350 align:middle line:84%
your belief system
is also very narrow.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.533 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Extremely narrow.

00:24:04.533 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have a lot
of restrictions.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of restrictions
that we're programmed with,

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
which is what he was talking
about, what's not possible.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot of don't,
don't, don't, or you

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:84%
can't, or nos, and that's
what we're dealing with.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So people are stuck in a
particular version of reality,

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.850 align:middle line:84%
a particular interpretation
of reality that's

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:90%
continuously reinforced.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:84%
It's always reinforced
from, again,

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:84%
the news, billboards,
everything around you.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.380 align:middle line:90%
The commercials.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Everything around you
reinforces the idea

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:84%
of a particular
version of reality.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, if you're between
the ages of 60 and 85,

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:90%
you need to get this.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So even that kind of
information is reinforcing

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.960 align:middle line:90%
just how long you can live.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So we're constantly
being reminded

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:11.720 align:middle line:84%
of the limitations and the
vulnerability of our bodies

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.118 align:middle line:90%
and just of us, period.

00:25:14.118 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are so
many people like sheep,

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.740 align:middle line:84%
though, Sonia, and
they simply follow?

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.500 align:middle line:84%
They follow the pattern,
the company line.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, I
think one, it's easier.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.360 align:middle line:84%
People tend to be
diehard a certain belief.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Like, whatever their
religious belief was.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:90%
My family believed that.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.230 align:middle line:90%
This is what I am.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.480 align:middle line:90%
No different than politics.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.030 align:middle line:84%
They're diehard,
whatever party it is.

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't want that
kind of responsibility.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.880 align:middle line:84%
To step out of that space
is a great responsibility

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.710 align:middle line:90%
because what happens is this.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
You start realizing that you are
really the owner of yourself.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:00.965 align:middle line:90%
You start realizing--

00:26:00.965 --> 00:26:01.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We always were.

00:26:01.965 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: We always were,
but they didn't get the memo.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.670 align:middle line:90%
So they are--

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody sent it.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Nobody sent it.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.328 align:middle line:84%
Either that, or they
got it and they just

00:26:11.328 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:84%
didn't look at it
because oh no, I have

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:90%
to be responsible for myself.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot
of ownership then.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
When you're taking
on responsibility,

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:84%
that level of
responsibility for yourself,

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.700 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot that you
have to come to grips with.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:84%
You have to face who you are,
the things that you've been.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Not for blame.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.520 align:middle line:84%
But in order to move
on to deeper levels,

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:90%
you must see what you've been.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, even when I say
"who you've been,"

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I need to clarify that because
we have reduced ourselves

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.550 align:middle line:90%
to what I call our character.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
We've reduced ourselves to
the identity, our identity,

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.610 align:middle line:84%
the identity that's been
designed for us from probably

00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:59.410 align:middle line:90%
in the womb.

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.493 align:middle line:84%
You're hearing Mom and
Dad from in the womb,

00:27:01.493 --> 00:27:02.410 align:middle line:90%
and then you come out.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And then there's your family,
and then there's society.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything is shaping and
telling you who you are.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Who is Sonia?

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And that was a question
I had to ask myself.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Is there an authentic me?

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:22.930 align:middle line:84%
You start realizing that you
are this compilation of data,

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:84%
of non-verifiable information
that you've been operating by,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.390 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
living your life by.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And you've become your
identity, the idea of--

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we change
this so we don't become

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.910 align:middle line:90%
such an obedient society?

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: You
can only change it

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:84%
when you wake up to realizing
that that's what's going on.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you give
yourself permission

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:84%
because this is all
permission based.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:84%
You, in the end, must give
your permission to yourself.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.220 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you give
that kind of permission?

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.273 align:middle line:84%
Even your brain--
let's just work with--

00:27:59.273 --> 00:28:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your persona.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: --your brain for now.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.190 align:middle line:90%
That starts to change.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:84%
It starts to get the information
that, oh, we're going

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:90%
beyond the standard protocol.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.880 align:middle line:84%
We're going beyond the
blueprint of reality

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.320 align:middle line:90%
that we've been carrying.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:90%
We're going beyond that.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.250 align:middle line:84%
So the brain that already has
access to everything, right?

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:25.990 align:middle line:84%
It's already can see
everything, zero, 65 degrees.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:90%
But it's been filtering.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It's been filtering
information and what

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:84%
you will see and
experience based

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.360 align:middle line:84%
on the blueprint of reality
that you've been holding.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So when it gets the
permission that you're

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.760 align:middle line:84%
willing and open now to
explore and to see more,

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:90%
ah, new things start to happen.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:84%
New neural pathways
start being created.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:90%
You are now ready to see more.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:84%
But until one is
ready, it will not

00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:00.490 align:middle line:84%
happen because you can't
convince anybody of anything.

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're dealing
with right now, as we see.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Fear is are a core thing for us.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.640 align:middle line:84%
We are designed-- the vehicle
is designed to survive.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:90%
We are all about survival.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who came up with
this concept to do this to us?

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, I'm not
sure if it's any one person.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:25.610 align:middle line:84%
I know there are people
that have other views on it.

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we
look at what we

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:34.900 align:middle line:84%
are in layers beyond this life,
I think we all came up with it.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I think we all came up with
it on a much bigger scale

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.870 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about
some incredible engineering,

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.050 align:middle line:84%
to engineer this
vehicle and to engineer

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:51.040 align:middle line:84%
this simulation or this
construct to really put this

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:84%
together so that
we could come in

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and do the one thing
that we're here to do,

00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:01.450 align:middle line:84%
to explore all the possibilities
of being a human being.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.160 align:middle line:90%
We cannot forget that.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So while you and I may not
explore certain possibilities,

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.330 align:middle line:90%
there is someone else that will.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you could possibly
think of and not think of

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.290 align:middle line:84%
has been explored
by someone here.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:21.760 align:middle line:84%
This is not an experience
where we are limited

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.380 align:middle line:90%
in what we can experience.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Nobody says, oh, you can
experience these things,

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.870 align:middle line:84%
but you can't experience
these other things.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the world wouldn't
be in a state that it is.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So there is a free
will to explore.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But you are exploring according
to your own awareness,

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.530 align:middle line:84%
according to your
own consciousness,

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:42.993 align:middle line:90%
according to where you are.

00:30:42.993 --> 00:30:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how
do we beat this

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.800 align:middle line:84%
though, Sonia, when we're
constantly being bombarded

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.310 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of things
that they're tricking us

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.740 align:middle line:84%
with in order for
them to accomplish

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.460 align:middle line:90%
what they want to do?

00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:00.450 align:middle line:84%
How can the person pull himself
or herself away from that?

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: OK, well, for one, it
is what I was saying, that yes,

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:08.530 align:middle line:90%
you have to want to.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
on the flip side,

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.570 align:middle line:84%
because there's always
two sides of a coin,

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:18.820 align:middle line:84%
we can also realize that this
is really creating a momentum.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:25.300 align:middle line:84%
It is really an opportunity in a
way that is pushing and forcing

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.920 align:middle line:90%
people forward.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can look
at what's going on

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:33.160 align:middle line:90%
from a destructive standpoint.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.800 align:middle line:84%
But look at the
question you're asking.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:40.670 align:middle line:84%
It's forcing some people
to say, wait a second.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.220 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.200 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of, in a way, waking
some people up to something

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.620 align:middle line:90%
isn't right here.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So it is doing
something as well.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.620 align:middle line:84%
It's doing that prodding at the
same time for those people who

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.240 align:middle line:90%
are in that mindset.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And the question you're
asking really, I think,

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:05.400 align:middle line:84%
applies only to people
who are ready to say

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.710 align:middle line:90%
something else is afoot.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.120 align:middle line:90%
I am ready to know.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.170 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:10.970 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we have that choice?

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Yes, we do.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:18.000 align:middle line:84%
We do because it is about
defining who is "we" then.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:84%
When we say "we," do
we have that choice?

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.680 align:middle line:84%
What has happened it
again is that we've

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:28.560 align:middle line:84%
reduced the totality of
what we are to this body,

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.220 align:middle line:90%
to this identity.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:35.190 align:middle line:84%
But what we are
is way bigger than

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.310 align:middle line:90%
this minuscule interpretation.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: It's huge.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So yes, that part of
us has the ability

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:47.730 align:middle line:84%
to do that when we
start to step away

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:84%
from putting all of the power
into this character identity

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:84%
self that's been
running the show.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.450 align:middle line:84%
This part of us is what's
really been operating down here.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the part of
us that feels pain,

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:84%
that's in fear, that's
doing all of that.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It's that character self
that's running around doing all

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.110 align:middle line:90%
these different performances.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's coming
into that realization that

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.900 align:middle line:84%
wait a second, that is not
the totality of who I am.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean from this
very fluffy standpoint.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking really looking
on and going, wait a second.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.760 align:middle line:84%
That is not the
totality of who I am.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Then you can step
back and you can

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:34.050 align:middle line:84%
see the character, the role,
whatever you call yourself,

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.070 align:middle line:90%
Sonia, has been playing.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Then there's an opportunity
for me to make changes.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It will impact your body
as well because what

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I've come to realize is
the science behind this,

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:84%
that aging, and death, and that
the whole process is connected

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.330 align:middle line:90%
with not being aware.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:01.080 align:middle line:84%
When we come back into a state
of awareness, what happens?

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:06.690 align:middle line:84%
You are engaging in an
incredible life flow,

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:10.440 align:middle line:84%
not one that is this fully
charged battery where you come

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.270 align:middle line:84%
in, and then it gradually
, wanes and then it fades,

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.070 align:middle line:90%
and it dies.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.949 align:middle line:84%
The only reason why
that really happens

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:20.100 align:middle line:90%
is because we stop expanding.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And when we stop
expanding, the brain

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:84%
takes its cue from the
consciousness, which

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.469 align:middle line:90%
is not much new coming in.

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:29.810 align:middle line:90%
We start shutting down.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, how somebody
shuts down or expires,

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it because
this is what expires.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.710 align:middle line:90%
A sensory system expires.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:41.400 align:middle line:84%
That expiration happens
simply because there

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:48.780 align:middle line:84%
is nothing new triggering
this infinite life flow.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.530 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go anywhere.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- I think
Gregg Braden, I believe,

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.190 align:middle line:84%
was talking about before
about that experiment

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:84%
that they did where they
realized the two atoms are not

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.060 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.810 align:middle line:84%
There were one in the
same, one in the same.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you think
of that, you'll

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:08.940 align:middle line:84%
realize that you are that
thing that you're looking for.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:90%
You are that atom.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:14.120 align:middle line:90%
You are that timeless--

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.980 align:middle line:90%
that has no name--

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.380 align:middle line:90%
I can't even say thing--

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.880 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't run out.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.370 align:middle line:84%
There is no such
thing as running out.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Time is an illusion.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a quantified
experience so that we

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:28.060 align:middle line:90%
can have this human experience.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But when we open
up, and the more

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:33.880 align:middle line:84%
we start to understand how
that's all being quantified,

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:84%
then we have an opportunity
to step into greater

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:90%
levels of experiencing.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's where that idea
of that supernatural self

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.010 align:middle line:90%
starts to come into play.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.810 align:middle line:90%
What can we do?

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen movies that
are trying to depict that.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.523 align:middle line:84%
Even the movie "Lucy,"
I think, was one.

00:35:53.523 --> 00:35:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Of course there's a lot of
Hollywood stuff in there.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's no mistake
that a lot of the films

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that you're seeing now that
are edgy in that manner,

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.840 align:middle line:84%
it's no mistake that
they're coming out.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Humans are being
triggered to remember

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.120 align:middle line:84%
that there is
something much more

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.650 align:middle line:84%
profound than the story you've
been told and the programming.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And we are at that
pinnacle right

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:21.670 align:middle line:84%
now for some to
make that expansion

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and go that way and some to
continue to remain in fear.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Either way, I
don't think there's

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:84%
any right or wrong with
what that process is

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.970 align:middle line:90%
or who does what.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But if one is ready
to really know,

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:41.080 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing that is
stopping you, nothing.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Because this is all
about frequencies,

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and vibrations, and
even a measurement

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.830 align:middle line:90%
of your brainwave patterns.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:57.520 align:middle line:84%
There is a point in moving into
the more supernatural state

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:02.470 align:middle line:84%
where I do think that we move
into different-- into higher

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:05.110 align:middle line:84%
levels then of frequency, just
because the thought process is

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:05.910 align:middle line:90%
changing.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, thoughts
measure a frequency.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Everything measures a frequency.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.640 align:middle line:90%
So what is the frequency?

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.280 align:middle line:84%
What is the measurement
of the kind of frequency

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.890 align:middle line:84%
that you're processing in terms
of what you believe and you

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:18.820 align:middle line:90%
understand?

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
talk about programming.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.270 align:middle line:90%
We are being programmed.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And I had a chance to talk
with an expert on programming

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:26.320 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Eldon Taylor.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.670 align:middle line:10%
My favorite poem is
the Robert Frost poem

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.100 align:middle line:10%
of "The Road Not
Taken," where he

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:38.330 align:middle line:10%
talks about this individual
looking at two scenarios.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:10%
And he took the road
less traveled by.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.140 align:middle line:10%
And in his mind, it
made all the difference.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.300 align:middle line:10%
Is that what you
also mean by choices?

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:51.950 align:middle line:10%
Picking and doing something
that could reflect something

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.330 align:middle line:10%
for maybe the rest of your life.

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:56.325 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you'll regret
it, maybe you won't.

00:37:56.325 --> 00:37:57.200 align:middle line:10%
>>ELDON TAYLOR: I do.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.320 align:middle line:10%
I absolutely do.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.910 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I am convinced
and the data shows

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:05.360 align:middle line:10%
is that we are
inculturated in such a way

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.040 align:middle line:10%
that we live our
lives as though we're

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.890 align:middle line:10%
answering a multiple-choice
question in school.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have A, B, and C.
Those are our choices.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Period, that's it.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.510 align:middle line:90%


00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.720 align:middle line:10%
I like to illustrate
that by telling

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.790 align:middle line:10%
a story that reflects it that
I call The Flower Pot Story.

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:30.500 align:middle line:10%
But the bottom line
comes down to this.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:34.250 align:middle line:10%
if I think I can
only do this or that,

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:37.250 align:middle line:10%
then that's how I respond.

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.710 align:middle line:10%
When I stop and
realize that there

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.610 align:middle line:10%
are all these
other alternatives,

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:43.787 align:middle line:10%
then my life changes.

00:38:43.787 --> 00:38:45.454 align:middle line:10%
It takes on a whole
different dimension.

00:38:45.454 --> 00:38:47.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --different meaning.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And Sonia, Eldon is
absolutely right.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Oh, absolutely.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:55.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea, then, that
there is a blueprint.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, collectively,
we are operating

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.010 align:middle line:84%
by what looks like
a similar version

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.320 align:middle line:90%
or interpretation of reality.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:08.690 align:middle line:84%
But in essence, each of us has
a unique blueprint of reality

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.310 align:middle line:90%
that we're operating by.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And that blueprint is
filled in by the information

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.720 align:middle line:84%
that you receive from your
childhood, from your families,

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.026 align:middle line:90%
from the environment, all--

00:39:20.026 --> 00:39:21.276 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From pressure groups.

00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:21.462 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:39:21.462 --> 00:39:22.337 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You name it.

00:39:22.337 --> 00:39:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: The way you've
assessed yourself, all of that.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when anything is
shifted from your reality,

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.250 align:middle line:90%
it becomes jarring.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.930 align:middle line:84%
When people leave that we're
used to having in our lives,

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.780 align:middle line:84%
that's the reason why
it all hurts so much.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't realize that
when things are ripped away,

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.640 align:middle line:84%
it's a readjustment that
has to happen because that

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.250 align:middle line:90%
was all part of our blueprint.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Our houses, the way
our houses are set up.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.310 align:middle line:84%
When you move to someplace
else, you have to adjust.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Everything has to be
readjusted in this blueprint.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And the other part
of that is the fact

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:05.730 align:middle line:90%
that we are creatures of habit.

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.850 align:middle line:90%
We are pattern based.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:14.150 align:middle line:84%
We get addicted to habits,
rituals, certain behaviors.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And then we get stuck with
operating that certain way.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult
for most people

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:27.920 align:middle line:84%
to shift out of an old model,
an old, comfortable model

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:90%
of operating.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we see much
of what is going on today,

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:36.320 align:middle line:84%
trying to get people to see
a different perspective,

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.610 align:middle line:90%
see something else.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:41.630 align:middle line:10%
And especially when people are,
as they say, of a certain age,

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:46.590 align:middle line:10%
they are really fixed in the
way that they see things.

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:54.680 align:middle line:10%
So there is no room to really go
into a deep level of expansion

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.280 align:middle line:10%
and see things a different
way and push those boundaries

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.802 align:middle line:10%
because it's too unknown.

00:40:59.802 --> 00:41:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's deeply unknown.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: People
don't like the unknown.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:03.658 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's deeply unknown.

00:41:03.658 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Sonia, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, thank
you so much for having me.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.030 align:middle line:90%
It was certainly a pleasure.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:09.822 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We can use
these tools that you've

00:41:09.822 --> 00:41:11.990 align:middle line:10%
been telling us to
change our lives

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:13.880 align:middle line:10%
and do it sooner than later.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
