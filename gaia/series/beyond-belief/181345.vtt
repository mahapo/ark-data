>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
One of my dear favorite friends
and guests, Barbara Lamb,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Barbara is a certified
hypnotherapist and regression

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:90%
therapist.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:84%
She's based out of
California but works

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:84%
all over the
country specializing

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:84%
in regression therapy, which
we're going to talk about.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing science.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Barbara, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.804 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA LAMB:
Thank you, George.

00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Happy to be here.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.319 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in hypnotherapy?

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:90%
How did that all start for you?

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: Well, I was a
psychotherapist from way back

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:10%
and then began to get
training in regression

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:10%
therapy in the 1980s.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And this was mostly for
taking people into past life

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:84%
experiences, but
regression therapy

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:84%
can be applied to any number
of interests that people have.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And in 1991, the first
person came to me

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
for wanting to know what
was going on with the visits

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.220 align:middle line:84%
that she was having
with very strange

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.460 align:middle line:84%
beings who were
not human beings.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And I did not know very much
about that at that time.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
But in working with
that first client,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and we did six
regressions, oh, I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:84%
began to learn a lot
about these visiting

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:90%
beings from other planets.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And she had several
different types

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:90%
of beings that came to her.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And each group that came did
different things with her,

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
including not only taking
her on board the ships,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.989 align:middle line:84%
but it included healing her
of a very bad ear infection--

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They healed her.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --she had.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So one night, with this
terrible, terrible pain

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
in her ear, these three very
thin, tall, white beings

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:90%
came into her bedroom.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And they rolled her
over on her side

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:90%
so the ear was on the upside.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
could get to it.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yeah.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And she was aware,
sort of semiconscious

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:84%
aware that they were doing
something in her ear.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:90%
And that went on for a while.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.547 align:middle line:84%
And she was a little
spooked that these--

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who wouldn't be, right?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --three
tall white beings

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:84%
who were not human
at all were there.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:84%
But she sensed that they
were trying to help her,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and indeed, they were.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And when they finished,
after a little while

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
of working in her
ear, they disappeared,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and she realized that she
was completely pain-free.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After all these years.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yeah.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So that was a quick
healing, and she

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
had many other kinds
of beings coming

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:90%
and different encounters.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.657 align:middle line:84%
Even had a hybrid baby
with one of those groups.

00:03:15.657 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
believe her, Barbara?

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: I did, yeah.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, in
hypnosis, the person

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:90%
is in a very, very deep state.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:90%
They're not aware of--

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're not lying
in that state, are they?

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --what's
going in the room.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
As far as I can tell,
it's very sincere.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell, in
watching the person I'm

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:84%
regressing, when they're
in that really, really

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:90%
deep state of relaxation.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that's
what hypnosis is.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a very deep
state of relaxation

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:84%
in which they are accessing the
material in their subconscious

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:90%
part of the mind.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So I like to have people
realize that the subconscious

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:84%
part of our minds, each
of us has this, of course.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious
part of the mind

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.560 align:middle line:84%
records absolutely everything
that we experience,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
including those things that
we're not consciously aware of.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a
tape recorder, isn't it?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: It is like a
tape recorder, yes.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And so the subconscious mind
records all that material

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and retains the material
and can yield it when

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.869 align:middle line:90%
the person wants to find out.

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I'm
convinced, Barbara,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
if you looked at a
group of 50 people,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.765 align:middle line:84%
and then somebody asked
you who are these people?

00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:44.390 align:middle line:84%
You probably don't
know who any of them

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
were because you had
50 people out there.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But under hypnosis, I
bet you could probably,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:84%
if you knew who they
were individually,

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:90%
you could pinpoint each one.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Probably, that's true.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So even though in these
extraterrestrial encounters,

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.970 align:middle line:84%
the person is typically aware
of just the first few moments

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:84%
of something
happening, like a light

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:84%
coming in the room or beings in
the room or a light following

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:84%
the car and the
car motor stopping,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:90%
and then seeing some beings.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So those things just take a
very few moments, usually,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the person
is consciously aware of.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But the subconscious
mind, fortunately,

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:84%
has recorded
everything else that

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:84%
happened when the person
was out of consciousness.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had mentioned
that, under hypnosis, people

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:90%
will not lie.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:90%
They just say it the way it is.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when
I was 21 years old,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Dr.
Benjamin Simon, who

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:84%
was the psychiatrist of Betty
and Barney Hill, really,

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.877 align:middle line:84%
the first well-known
alien abduction case.

00:05:55.877 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes, it was.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I asked
him specifically--

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:90%
he was in Boston.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:90%
I was in Detroit.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.350 align:middle line:84%
But we had him recorded
over the phone.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Dr. Simon, were
they telling you the truth?

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.044 align:middle line:90%
And he said, they weren't lying.

00:06:10.044 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what's the difference?

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said, in their mind,
whatever happened to them,

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
both of them individually--
and I hypnotized them both--

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:90%
they said the same story.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:84%
This alien abduction
case happened to them.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:90%
They believe that.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So they're not lying to
me, but they actually

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:84%
believe that's what
happened to them.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I had no reason
to doubt that it did not.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
what you're saying here,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
too, is under hypnosis,
people say it the way it is.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:90%
The way they perceive it to be.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Right, yes.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:90%
And they're sincere.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And you see, when people
come to me for regression,

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
they already really
want to know the truth.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
They want to know what
actually happened to them.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Regardless
of what it is?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes, yes.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And that reminds me to say
that very often, people will

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:90%
wait for a long time to come.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they might
have an experience at age eight

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:84%
or age 10 or 16,
and then they may

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:84%
wait until they're in
their 30s, 40s, 50s, or 60s

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to actually come and
have a regression

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:90%
to find out the details.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
lot of bad press

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
about extraterrestrial
encounters,

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
a lot of fear, a
lot of negativity.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doubt.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: And yeah, doubt and
of course, mystery about it.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And the unknown is very
often what we fear.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
But once we get to
know what happens,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
as we do in a regression,
even though the person might

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:84%
have been very
frightened beforehand.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.695 align:middle line:84%
They usually find in
regression that oh, phew, OK.

00:08:02.695 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
relieved, aren't they?

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Now I know.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.795 align:middle line:90%
Now I can deal with it.

00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:84%
It's often what we don't know
that's in the subconscious

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:19.160 align:middle line:84%
mind that worries us more than
what we actually find out.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:90%
So regression is a therapy.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I consider it very much
a therapy because it

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
helps the person, even though
the person may find out

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.720 align:middle line:84%
that there were some things
that went on in the encounter

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:84%
that they really didn't like,
but they always survive.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:90%
They always come back.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:90%
They go on with their lives.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:90%
They're OK.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And once it makes sense to them,
that really is a help to them.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well,
you're doing your job

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:57.560 align:middle line:10%
and let's look at
you doing your job

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: You're just here,
resting and relaxing,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:10%
going deeper and
deeper into relaxation.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Deeper and deeper into
your subconscious mind.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Deeper into all the
details so that you

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:17.560 align:middle line:84%
can relive the details of
whatever it was that occurred

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:90%
that night, April 14, 2010.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Sleeping in your
bed and awakening

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and being aware
of being somewhere

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:38.886 align:middle line:84%
else that impressed you as some
sort of military installation.

00:09:38.886 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, was that the
real deal or was that the--

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: That was
a real regression.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.710 align:middle line:84%
The woman whom I was
regressing was the co-author

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
of my book called
"Alien Experiences."

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:90%
And she was an experiencer.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.500 align:middle line:84%
She'd had experiences
all of her life,

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and she wanted to
know what had gone on.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
She knew she had those
experiences and many, many

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.850 align:middle line:84%
of them over a
period of many years.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't
they recollect this?

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, the beings who
come and interact with people

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:84%
seem to have a way of
putting the people out

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:90%
of conscious awareness.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:90%
We call it being switched off.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Almost erase the memory
at least in your--

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yeah.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't erase the
memory they just--

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Alter it?

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --make it so that the
person isn't aware of what's

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:90%
actually transpiring.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And some of the beings have
said in some regressions

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:84%
that they do that because if
the person remained consciously

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:84%
aware of not only the
beings coming into the room

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:84%
but actually levitating
them up out of the bed

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and floating them through the
wall, which typically happens,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and through the air and onto
a spaceship, that the person

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:90%
would freak out.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:90%
I could see that happening.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yeah And with
one lady I worked

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.280 align:middle line:84%
with for many regressions,
she got to a point

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:84%
where she wanted to have
her next experience be

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.130 align:middle line:84%
one in which she could
remain conscious and awake

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:90%
for the whole experience.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So she asked the beings, just
by meditating and asking them,

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.730 align:middle line:84%
to please let her
remain completely

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:84%
conscious in her
next experience.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And so in her next
experience, the beings came

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and they started levitating
her up off her bed.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And when she was about
six feet up above the bed

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:90%
and looked down--

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She wanted to go
back to the old ways, right?

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: She really freaked out.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:84%
She hadn't thought she
would, but she did.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:90%
She started flailing around.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, the beings--
there were about four beings--

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
they wrapped her
up like a cocoon,

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:11.420 align:middle line:84%
in what appeared to be a fish
netting-type of substance.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So they wrapped her
up like a cocoon,

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and then continued
levitating her, taking her

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
through the wall, and
putting her on the ship.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And when she was on the
ship, they stood her upright

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:90%
and unfurled this netting.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we thought
that this might happen,

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't want to harm
yourself by flailing around,

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.479 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't want
you to harm us.

00:12:38.479 --> 00:12:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were right.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: They were right.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.241 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were right.

00:12:41.241 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: And most people
would react that way.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So it makes it very
simple and easy

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:84%
for them to put the person
out of conscious awareness.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, the person is
not being harmed

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:84%
by being out of
conscious awareness,

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
but it just makes everything
so much simpler and smoother

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
to take them and do
what they're going to do

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and then return them without the
person being consciously aware.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the individual
come to you, Barbara,

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:90%
or do you find them?

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what makes
them say, I need

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:90%
to have hypnotic regression?

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.920 align:middle line:84%
I need to go into
some state to see what

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:90%
was happening with me before.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.630 align:middle line:90%
How does that occur?

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Well, they come to me.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And they know about me from a
variety of ways and interviews,

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:84%
such as this, and
lectures that I give

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.392 align:middle line:90%
and things that I have written.

00:13:31.392 --> 00:13:33.475 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're based
out of San Diego, right?

00:13:33.475 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: I'm based out
of San Diego, um-hm,

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And have been in California
in another location,

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.770 align:middle line:90%
too, for many years.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So they find me
somehow publicly,

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
or they might hear me
give a lecture and think,

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:84%
oh, here's somebody who could
help me with my experience.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it that gets
them to you in the first place?

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because if they
don't have any recollection,

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.140 align:middle line:84%
how do they know that
something's happened to them?

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Mm-hm Well, sometimes
people have had a very vivid

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:90%
UFO sighting, and they just--

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which they remember.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Which they
consciously remember.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that whole
experience was conscious.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, they have a
witness who also saw that UFO.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And in cases where they've
really been impressed,

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:84%
it really makes
an impact on them

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:84%
to see that, then they begin to
wonder if something else might

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.660 align:middle line:90%
have happened?

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Especially when they've
had a sighting and then

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.330 align:middle line:84%
there was a couple of hours of
missing time right after that.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:90%
And they think, well, gee.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if there was
more to that experience

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:90%
than I consciously knew?

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So they will sometimes sort of
ruminate over that for years,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:84%
and then when they
finally realize

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:84%
there's somebody who could help
them to remember the details,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.750 align:middle line:84%
then they might
go to that person.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.629 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's me or to
another hypnotherapist.

00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had a case, Barbara,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:18.130 align:middle line:84%
that was so bizarre, so strange,
even you, as a hypnotherapist,

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:90%
said, gosh, I don't know?

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.190 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: [LAUGHS]
I've had many that

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:90%
were very, very strange to me.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.700 align:middle line:84%
A huge variety of
experiences happen

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
because here's a huge
variety of beings that come.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like each group
of beings has their own agenda.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's many,
many things that

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:84%
happen between people
and extraterrestrials

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.390 align:middle line:90%
when these encounters occur.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
But some of them, yes,
are really quite bizarre

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and things that I never
would have thought of

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and the person never would have
thought of, such as meeting up

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:90%
with reptilian beings.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.885 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the--

00:16:04.885 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those aren't the
good guys either, are they?

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --usual type.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, reptilian beings,
in general, I think,

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:84%
have gotten a pretty
bad rap by humans.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And some of them may
deserve it, in the sense

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:84%
that they're very big and
very muscular and sort

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:90%
of domineering.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.236 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
kind of devilish.

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Authoritative.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And they seem like they could
be very dangerous and negative.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:84%
However, when I've
regressed people

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:84%
to reptilians of
that type, they don't

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:84%
do anything terrible to
the person or harmful.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:90%
They just look fearful.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And I hasten to
say that it seems

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:84%
like there's quite a variety
of extraterrestrial beings.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And some are even friendly and
nice for the person to be with.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:84%
But I think what tends
to get publicized

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
is about the ones
who kind of think

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:84%
they're very full of grandeur
and more authoritative.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.119 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or evil.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yeah, who
are domineering.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. John Mack, the late
Dr. John Mack, psychiatrist,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:84%
specialized a lot
into alien abductions.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Richard Dolan, on one
of our Gaia programs,

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:90%
talked about that.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.660 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
There is little

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.270 align:middle line:10%
that can be more terrifying
for a human being than to be

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.664 align:middle line:10%
overtaken by another species.

00:17:33.664 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:10%
This is what occurs
during what is

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:10%
called the phenomena
of alien abduction.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:10%
Though a highly
controversial subject,

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:10%
it's been studied
in depth, including

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.990 align:middle line:10%
by a leading psychologist at
Harvard University, Dr. John

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.790 align:middle line:10%
Mack.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:84%
His findings, something
real is happening.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.885 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with Richard Dolan
about Dr. Mack's conclusions.

00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOLAN:
They'll say, oh,

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:10%
John Mack thought that
the ETs were good,

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:10%
whereas people like Bud
Hopkins and David Jacobs

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:10%
think the ETs are bad.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.265 align:middle line:84%
And it's really not
that simplistic.

00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:84%
What John Mack said is,
look, a lot of people

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle line:84%
had very, very frightening
experiences here.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:84%
But what he pointed
out is if you

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:84%
are going to go through any kind
of true growth in your life,

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:84%
it's going to involve stripping
away closely-held illusions.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.590 align:middle line:90%
We all grew up with illusions.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.560 align:middle line:84%
You have, I have, everyone
listening has grown up

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:90%
with false beliefs.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you are going
to go beyond that

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and truly develop into
something beyond this little box

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
of reality that you're
placed in, right, then

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.520 align:middle line:84%
you have to go through a
painful process of facing down

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.152 align:middle line:84%
lies and illusions,
and it's not fun.

00:18:43.152 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:90%
No one ever wants to do that.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
John Mack was saying

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:84%
is that this was a
component of what we call

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.426 align:middle line:90%
the alien abduction experience.

00:18:53.426 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:84%
He didn't really like to
use the phrase "abduction"

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:84%
but essentially, that's an
important component of it.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, does that mean that their
intentions were all good?

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he would
even go so far as to say that

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:84%
but that the repercussions
of the contact that we

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:84%
have with them could result
in true human growth.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at people
who have had these experiences,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:90%
many of them have developed--

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Psychic abilities.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: --psychic
abilities and also interests

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:84%
that have to do with a kind
of a global consciousness.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:90%
This is very typical.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's something going
on there that is not--

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.836 align:middle line:84%
you can use a
traumatic experience

00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:84%
to get personal
growth out of it,

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.027 align:middle line:90%
and I think that was his point.

00:19:35.027 --> 00:19:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there something
going on, Barbara, something

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.860 align:middle line:90%
happening with this phenomenon?

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Oh, yes,
and by the way, I

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:84%
was a colleague and
friend of John Mack.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:84%
We had many, many
discussions together.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And he was interested in
all the types of beings,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:90%
including the reptilian beings.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:84%
We had planned to give a big
lecture together on reptilians

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and also to write
a book together,

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.152 align:middle line:90%
and then unfortunately, he was--

00:20:03.152 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Got hit by that car.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --killed, run over.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.640 align:middle line:84%
But yes, he was
convinced and I am

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:84%
convinced that many
people do have encounters

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.620 align:middle line:84%
with these beings,
that they are real.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Probably most
people in the world

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.817 align:middle line:84%
do not have these encounters
and find it very difficult to--

00:20:26.817 --> 00:20:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or they don't remember.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --even believe.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Or they don't remember, yeah.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's amazing,
the number of people

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I meet, of all
walks of life, who

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.960 align:middle line:84%
have had mysterious
moments here and there

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.474 align:middle line:84%
that they remember that just
don't fit into the rest of--

00:20:48.474 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like little
glimpses of things.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --their reality.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just a few moments
of maybe unusual lights

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:84%
coming in the room or
little sparkles of light

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:84%
flying around the room or
a very, very bright light

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.700 align:middle line:84%
suddenly outside the window of
the room where they're sleeping

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:84%
or a light following
the car they're

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:90%
driving in and so forth.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And they look up, and they see
that there's a lighted craft

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:90%
overhead.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
these bits and pieces

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and hence, also many people
have unusual markings

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:84%
on their bodies that
they wake up and notice.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And they think, how
could I have done that?

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have done
that during my sleep.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Like little patterns of what
look like pinprick marks done

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.310 align:middle line:90%
in a perfect circle.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anything major like
a huge stitch or anything

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: No.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I've never known of
any really big thing,

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:50.260 align:middle line:84%
but little scoop-shaped
marks and little triangular

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:84%
bruise marks and
what looked like

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
little fingertip-shaped bruise
marks and things of that sort.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And like, a straight
line cut in the arm,

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:90%
I've seen on a couple of people.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we've regressed to the
source of that, how it happened

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.630 align:middle line:84%
that they had that
marking on their body,

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
that's when the whole
experience opens up

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:90%
when that marking was made.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that I've found,
which is very interesting,

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.160 align:middle line:84%
is that when I'm
doing a regression,

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I ask the person I'm
regressing if they would

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
like to know why
the beings are doing

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.420 align:middle line:90%
that particular procedure?

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And the person will say,
yes, I'd like to know.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
you can ask them.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And the person might
say, but I can't talk.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:90%
I can't move, and I can't talk.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
that's OK, because you

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:84%
can ask them the
question in your mind,

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.541 align:middle line:84%
and that's how the beings
communicate anyway.

00:22:58.541 --> 00:22:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Telepathically.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Telepathically, yeah.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:84%
So they'll ask the
question, like, why are you

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:08.500 align:middle line:84%
making that straight line
cut in my right forearm,

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:90%
as an example.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you want?

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yeah.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the beings, always when
the person asks the question,

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:22.010 align:middle line:84%
they will always honor the
person by giving an answer.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Like, for instance,
with a straight line cut

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.270 align:middle line:84%
that one woman had
in her forearm,

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.384 align:middle line:84%
and it left kind of a white
scar, thin white scar.

00:23:32.384 --> 00:23:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they seem
to heal it for them too?

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.133 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Oh, they do.

00:23:35.133 --> 00:23:39.239 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they do, they
seem to heal right up.

00:23:39.239 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Which is good, of course.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.064 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
give you an open wound

00:23:42.064 --> 00:23:42.980 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: No, no.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.740 align:middle line:84%
The person comes
back already healed.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:84%
They have very fast
methods of healing.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.440 align:middle line:90%
I wish we had them too.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, with a
straight line cut,

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.190 align:middle line:84%
the being said, well,
there is something

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:84%
in your vein in that
part of your arm

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that is very, very helpful
to our newborn offspring,

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:13.146 align:middle line:84%
a particular ingredient in
that vein from a human--

00:24:13.146 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then they take it?

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: They take a section of
the vein and heal it right up.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And they use that section,
somehow, with their infants

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:84%
so that they will be healthier,
stronger, more robust.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that
a violation, Barbara?

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Because they are doing things
without your permission.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Oh, that's an
excellent question.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
It certainly seems like
they are doing these things

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.200 align:middle line:90%
without our permission.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.660 align:middle line:84%
However, many people come in,
and they ask the question,

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:90%
why me?

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Why are these things
happening to me and yet not

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:90%
to anybody else I know?

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And I would wonder
that too, of course.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So in a regression,
we can go back

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:04.650 align:middle line:84%
to the very source of their
having these experiences--

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:84%
the beginning, the root of
their having these experiences

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.270 align:middle line:84%
with the
extraterrestrial beings.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And what has come out of
regressions like that,

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:84%
without my suggesting
it at all--

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:90%
I make no suggestions--

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that the person has discovered
that just before coming

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
into this lifetime as
the person they are,

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:84%
they've had sort of a
planning session as a soul.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And in that planning
session, they're

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.480 align:middle line:84%
deciding some of the
major types of things

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.570 align:middle line:84%
they'll be experiencing
in this life in order

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to learn from them,
to grow and develop.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And they'll decide who
the main people are

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:84%
going to be in
their life and where

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.720 align:middle line:84%
they will be in the world,
which culture, which religion,

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And in that planning
session, some

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.960 align:middle line:84%
of the souls of
extraterrestrial beings

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
come in and ask if the person
would agree to work with them,

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.280 align:middle line:84%
cooperate with
them here, in their

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:84%
"here," in terms of projects
that the beings are doing.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And in that planning
session of the soul,

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.980 align:middle line:84%
the soul has
decided, yes, I'll do

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.860 align:middle line:84%
that in addition to
all the other things

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.176 align:middle line:84%
I'm choosing to do
in that lifetime.

00:26:33.176 --> 00:26:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barbara,
kind of take us

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:90%
through a step of regression.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.500 align:middle line:84%
When you do this for
somebody, how do you do it?

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Use me as a subject,
for example.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: OK.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Well the person comes in
with sometimes three or four

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:84%
or more things that they
would like to find out about.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.560 align:middle line:84%
But for one regression,
we need to choose

00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:00.102 align:middle line:84%
one item, one topic,
one event, let's say--

00:27:00.102 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So I'll say to you--

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.976 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --they would
like to know about.

00:27:02.976 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --do I
have a past life?

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.760 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to know if I do.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yes well,
that certainly happens

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:90%
in some of the regressions.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't
know, and I don't know.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So we choose that as a
topic, that if the person has

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:27.040 align:middle line:84%
had a previous lifetime, let's
go to that in the regression

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, we don't know
yet, at that point.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So then the next thing is that
I take usually about 15 minutes

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.660 align:middle line:84%
to help the person get
into a nice state of really

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.430 align:middle line:90%
deep relaxation.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they always lying
down like we saw with Nadine?

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:84%
They're lying down on
a sofa or a mattress,

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.480 align:middle line:84%
something where they can be
really, really comfortable.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just like a real
doctor's office, right?

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: More comfortable
than a doctor's office, yes,

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.260 align:middle line:90%
definitely so.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And warm, sometimes, they might
want a little warm blanket

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.920 align:middle line:84%
over them, just so
that they can forget

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.440 align:middle line:84%
the needs of the
physical body and really,

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:90%
really deeply relax.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And while they're
doing the relaxation,

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.870 align:middle line:84%
while I'm guiding
that, I'm suggesting

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:84%
that they're going back
to the topic of interest.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Like in that case, they're going
back to a previous lifetime

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.320 align:middle line:90%
if they have had one.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And with my having been trained
for five years in past life

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:84%
regression therapy and having
done, oh, 2,000 or 3,000

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:90%
of those, as well.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That many?

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yes, over a period
of a number of years,

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have a sense that
we not only have a past life

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:84%
but all of us have
had many past lives.

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they have
problems distinguishing

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.990 align:middle line:84%
the specific past life
they want to talk about?

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Do they intermingle
with other lives,

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.010 align:middle line:84%
or do they stay
pretty well focused.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, usually it
stays focused on one life.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.970 align:middle line:10%
Like, if we've asked
in the induction, which

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:22.120 align:middle line:10%
is the relaxation portion, we've
asked to go back to a lifetime.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And to make it
worthwhile, I suggest

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that they go back
to a past life,

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:34.370 align:middle line:84%
if they have had one, a past
life of real importance,

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:84%
one that would be important
for them to know about.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Because probably they've
had hundreds of past lives.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I know that, but
they don't know that.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So I ask that they go back
to one of real importance

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.250 align:middle line:90%
for them to know about now.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And not all of them are
significant past lives, right?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: No.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not everybody
is Cleopatra or Mark

00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Antony or whatever.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: No, no.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've only had in
all the couple of thousand

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.470 align:middle line:84%
regressions I've
done to past lives,

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:13.180 align:middle line:84%
there's been only one person
who went back to a significantly

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.130 align:middle line:90%
known person.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:84%
That happened to be the
Tsar, the last Tsar of Russia

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and went through the Russian
Revolution and the killing

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.630 align:middle line:84%
in the basement and
all the details.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Which, the woman who
was being regressed

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.630 align:middle line:84%
knew that the Russian
Revolution had happened

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and the Tsar had been killed but
didn't know any of the details

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and all of that came
out in the regression.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And then she got
some history books

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and started reading
about it and realized

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.570 align:middle line:84%
that what she had
uncovered in the regression

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:53.750 align:middle line:84%
were the details that
actually happened in reality.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.050 align:middle line:84%
But out of all of
these subjects,

00:30:56.050 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:84%
that was the only one who was
a famous person in a past life.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
mentioned that the ETs seem

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:05.920 align:middle line:84%
to want to heal people
from afflictions.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Oh, yes.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's their
method for doing this?

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.330 align:middle line:90%
And why are they doing this?

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:11.871 align:middle line:84%
Are they are doing
it because they're

00:31:11.871 --> 00:31:14.860 align:middle line:84%
good people or good
entities or what?

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, many
of the beings seem

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:23.380 align:middle line:84%
to be very, very caring
about humans and caring

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.240 align:middle line:90%
about the Earth.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Some of the beings
do not seem to be

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:30.000 align:middle line:90%
caring in that benevolent way.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.416 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
where David Jacobs

00:31:31.416 --> 00:31:32.830 align:middle line:84%
comes in and talks
about the fact

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:90%
that they are not benevolent.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.425 align:middle line:84%
David Jacobs and
I know each other

00:31:38.425 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:90%
and have had many conversations.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And we realize that we
are, for the most part,

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.450 align:middle line:84%
coming up with really
different things

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:84%
happening with
extraterrestrial encounters,

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.990 align:middle line:90%
and it's quite amazing, really.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:90%
We form a polarity in that way.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And I have some people who
have negative experiences

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:06.670 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials too but
so many of them, more of them,

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.250 align:middle line:84%
seem to have
experiences that show

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:13.030 align:middle line:90%
that the beings are benevolent.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Most of them.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yeah, or many.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I would think most of them are
very benevolent, very caring

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:90%
about humanity and the Earth.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So one of the indications
of their caring

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:30.285 align:middle line:84%
is that sometimes they will
heal the person they have taken.

00:32:30.285 --> 00:32:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
they know there's

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.070 align:middle line:90%
something wrong with them?

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, they are very
insightful, very intelligent.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And they also do examinations
of the body sometimes.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the negative
side of the thing,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.850 align:middle line:84%
we hear of people
really complaining

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:84%
about the rectal probe,
and of course, they

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:53.850 align:middle line:90%
complain about that.

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: We do not like
to go through that.

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:57.811 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, nobody does.

00:32:57.811 --> 00:32:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: We have our
proctological exams here

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.620 align:middle line:90%
on Earth--

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're bad enough.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --which
we actually agree

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.980 align:middle line:84%
to do because we know
it's important to find out

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:10.120 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in the
colon and the intestines.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So these beings sometimes
will do a proctological exam,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and they said to one of
my clients in regression,

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.600 align:middle line:84%
they said that this
kind of exam is

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.910 align:middle line:84%
the most helpful, informative
exam that they can possibly

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.070 align:middle line:90%
give a person.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:84%
That by this rectal probe,
that they can tell what

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.640 align:middle line:84%
every single system
of the body is doing,

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.310 align:middle line:90%
how each system is functioning.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And then from that,
sometimes they

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
realize, oh, this person has
a liver problem or a stomach

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.590 align:middle line:90%
problem or a heart problem.

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the
very same session,

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:04.820 align:middle line:84%
frequently, they will go ahead
and heal whatever is wrong.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.699 align:middle line:84%
And once in a while, the
beings have told the person

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:13.150 align:middle line:84%
after a checkup, tell
the person, you better

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:18.639 align:middle line:84%
go back and tell your doctor
that you have a liver problem,

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:20.332 align:middle line:90%
if that's what they have.

00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they haven't
fixed it yet, I guess.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: So they have
different methods of healing,

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:29.409 align:middle line:84%
and people describe them
as they're going on.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:33.909 align:middle line:84%
You see, in a regression, we
go moment by moment by moment

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:84%
through the experience from
the beginning to the end.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if the person
is reliving those moments

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.270 align:middle line:90%
of the whole experience.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barbara, Preston
Dennett is a UFO investigator,

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.719 align:middle line:84%
and he would agree with
you about these healing

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:56.774 align:middle line:90%
properties that are happening.

00:34:56.774 --> 00:34:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PRESTON DENNETT: I think the
healings can be broken down

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.800 align:middle line:90%
into four major categories.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.900 align:middle line:10%
There are people who
are healed while walking

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.690 align:middle line:10%
outside or driving and they're
struck by a beam of light

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:06.960 align:middle line:10%
from a UFO.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.010 align:middle line:10%
About 49% of the cases,
people are actually taken

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.460 align:middle line:10%
onboard and given a
surgery of some type.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:17.160 align:middle line:10%
Strange instruments are passed
over their bodies, something

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:17.960 align:middle line:10%
like this.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they are
given injections.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And about 20% of the
cases, the aliens

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.170 align:middle line:84%
actually come to the
people's bedrooms.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's like an
alien house call.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is my
favorite category--

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:35.710 align:middle line:84%
11% of the cases occur
inside hospital rooms,

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.810 align:middle line:84%
where the aliens actually
materialize in the room,

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:42.230 align:middle line:84%
effect a cure very quickly,
and then dematerialize.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know it sounds
incredible, but we've

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.305 align:middle line:90%
got several cases of that.

00:35:46.305 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I haven't
heard of that, where

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.030 align:middle line:90%
they pop up in hospital rooms.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yes, well
they do and especially

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.160 align:middle line:90%
in regard to newborn babies.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the ETs
will come in, and they

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:05.400 align:middle line:84%
have a way of making the
other hospital personnel be

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.240 align:middle line:90%
briefly out of consciousness.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they don't
see them, I guess, right?

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes, right.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and they
don't even realize

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that they've had any missing
time because it usually

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.530 align:middle line:90%
is quite brief.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is everything
so secretive, Barbara?

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:90%
Why not just come above board?

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, is it that
freaking out situation?

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: I think so.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:27.990 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the main reason.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And they also don't want
to be stopped from whatever

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.450 align:middle line:90%
they've come to do.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to get
back to the healing.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I gave Preston Dennett a
few of my healing cases

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.437 align:middle line:84%
that had come up from
my regression work.

00:36:43.437 --> 00:36:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He seems very
good at what he does.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Oh, he's excellent,
wonderful fellow, yes.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes, people have
been healed onboard the craft.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're lying on a
medical type of table.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And there will be a very,
very bright light coming down

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.715 align:middle line:90%
toward them from above.

00:37:05.715 --> 00:37:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And it feels very warm
and feels wonderful.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Feels very reassuring, very
sort of like a salve of light.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes
people have described

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:84%
that it's as if there's a
cylinder of light rolling up

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:84%
over their body, like a
tube of light rolling up

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:34.290 align:middle line:84%
from their knees, right on
up through their whole torso

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and up through the head if
the problem is in the head,

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.930 align:middle line:84%
and they get a
healing with that.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:49.680 align:middle line:84%
One of my clients was
suspended in the air for hours,

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and there were laser
light-- little thin,

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:84%
like finger-thick laser lights
coming from all directions,

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.930 align:middle line:90%
under, to the sides, from above.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And the laser lights
were penetrating her body

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and healing a very rare
blood disorder that she had.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.452 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's good
old hands-on healing.

00:38:13.452 --> 00:38:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wish they could
teach us how they do this.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Oh, yes.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What it would do
for modern medicine, my god.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.494 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Oh, it
would be wonderful.

00:38:20.494 --> 00:38:21.410 align:middle line:90%
If we could use that--

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:22.576 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will that day come?

00:38:22.576 --> 00:38:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --technology--
I hope so.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:26.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that's one
of the indications

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that they are caring about
the people they take.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
indications that they

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:42.930 align:middle line:84%
care about humanity as a
whole and the physical Earth

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:44.190 align:middle line:90%
as a whole.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So they warn many,
many people, whom

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:52.290 align:middle line:84%
they take for these
experiences, they warn them

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:58.500 align:middle line:84%
about catastrophes, man-made
catastrophes, and natural Earth

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:03.150 align:middle line:84%
catastrophes or comet
strikes or sun flares

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.790 align:middle line:84%
or any of those kinds of
things that could really

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.310 align:middle line:90%
cause widespread damage.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what do the
people do with that information?

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, in
many cases, they

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:16.710 align:middle line:84%
work for ecological
improvements.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:20.520 align:middle line:84%
They work for trying to
stop some of the methods

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.430 align:middle line:84%
that we have that are
really polluting the Earth.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:84%
They get very inspired in these
experiences, and many of them

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.740 align:middle line:84%
translate that into the
work that they actually

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.312 align:middle line:90%
do back here in their lives.

00:39:34.312 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With Preston,
he was talking, Barbara,

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:84%
about various ways that they
take you aboard or heal you,

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:42.600 align:middle line:84%
in a hospital
room, on the craft,

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:84%
hitting you with a bolt
of energy and light.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:49.696 align:middle line:84%
What would you say would be the
most prevalent way of doing it?

00:39:49.696 --> 00:39:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Well, I would say--

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Taking
somebody aboard craft?

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Although, I told about the
lady who had the ear infection

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.940 align:middle line:84%
healed right there
in her bed at home,

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and there have been
a few instances

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.990 align:middle line:90%
of that type of healing.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:07.890 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, they
seem to be taken

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:84%
onboard the craft, laid
on a medical-type table,

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.650 align:middle line:90%
and the healing happens then.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And so often, it involves light,
a special kind of light that

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:22.630 align:middle line:90%
is put on them in various ways.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Light therapy seems
to work, even nowadays, for us.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes, yes, it does.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:27.960 align:middle line:90%
And they're advanced.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, we will advance in
some of those ways as well.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Another way that they seem
to be helping humanity

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:41.820 align:middle line:84%
is giving downloads of the
information to some people.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:47.340 align:middle line:84%
A typical way is to give a
download to an engineer who

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.267 align:middle line:90%
is working on high technology.

00:40:49.267 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Giving him
the solution, huh?

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yes,
including healing-type

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:56.670 align:middle line:84%
of modalities,
that the engineer,

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:01.740 align:middle line:84%
having received the download,
can go ahead and invent.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:06.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our inventions and our
understanding of the universe,

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:10.160 align:middle line:84%
of physics understanding,
for instance,

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:90%
has come in terms of downloads.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's been
known that even

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein had
big downloads, which

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.970 align:middle line:84%
helped him to create his
theory of relativity.

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:29.592 align:middle line:84%
And other scientists
get downloads too.

00:41:29.592 --> 00:41:31.300 align:middle line:84%
People get downloads
in many of the arts.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they may have
done that with da Vinci,

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:34.290 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did he
have his visions?

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: That's right.

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And some of the greatest
musicians and greatest

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:47.690 align:middle line:84%
thinkers in the world,
they get downloads.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Grant Cameron, for instance,
was talking recently

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:57.680 align:middle line:84%
about how he will take a long
walk, and while he's walking

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and his mind is sort
of open, that he

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:06.480 align:middle line:84%
will get some of the downloads
of understanding that he gets.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think many people
in many professions

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.090 align:middle line:90%
get those downloads.

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to,
as a kid, I would

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:18.050 align:middle line:84%
look at the stars at night, and
I would always pray for a UFO

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:19.910 align:middle line:90%
to come down or do something.

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, I never saw one then.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But you never know
what happened.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.642 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they did come down and
beam me or something like that.

00:42:27.642 --> 00:42:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Well, maybe they did.

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And get me
into the field I'm in.

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:32.254 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, that's
right, because you

00:42:32.254 --> 00:42:36.530 align:middle line:90%
have a wonderfully open mind.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:40.925 align:middle line:84%
You're so receptive to learning
from all these different people

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and learning about many, many
different aspects of reality.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm hungry to learn.

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they thought, yeah, let's
use this guy as an instrument.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
extremely possible.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Would not be surprised at all.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm one of
those people, too,

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:02.050 align:middle line:84%
who's very, very interested
in the whole picture.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:04.250 align:middle line:90%
You have a passion for this.

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: I do, yeah.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that they
assist me, too, in this

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and have given me a few
experiences as well, which

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:17.390 align:middle line:90%
I think are wonderful.

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So more and more
people, George, I'm

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:24.560 align:middle line:84%
meeting, who are having
extraterrestrial encounters

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and really value
those encounters

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:34.310 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the beings who
come and interact with humans

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:36.230 align:middle line:90%
are so benevolent.

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:40.820 align:middle line:84%
They're so highly
evolved in consciousness,

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and they not only heal
people but they inspire them

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and teach them, even
rescue them, sometimes,

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.750 align:middle line:90%
when they're in trouble.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're doing
all kinds of things, not just

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:54.590 align:middle line:90%
healing people.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:57.590 align:middle line:84%
They're giving us
information, advice.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:59.180 align:middle line:84%
They're doing all
kinds of stuff.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they really are.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways
that they're helping

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:07.640 align:middle line:84%
is creating the
kinds of hybrids who

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.030 align:middle line:84%
can carry on some of
their good work here

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:15.350 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, helping
humanity to evolve.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.600 align:middle line:84%
So those are not
the hybrids who are

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.140 align:middle line:84%
continuing to live on the
ship and can never come here.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.230 align:middle line:90%
There are plenty of those too.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little
difficult to know

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.700 align:middle line:84%
exactly what the
purpose of that is,

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:35.840 align:middle line:84%
but they do add genetics
to some human embryos

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.860 align:middle line:84%
or even create an embryo
made of the mother's

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:44.660 align:middle line:84%
eggs and the father's sperm
and their extraterrestrial

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.100 align:middle line:90%
genetics.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And then they will implant
that in the human mother

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and she will carry
that full-term

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and give birth the
way that we humans do.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And that hybrid
child will grow up

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:05.360 align:middle line:90%
and live right here in society.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And in the 15 people I know
who were created as hybrids

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.470 align:middle line:84%
that way and are living
with us and look perfectly

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:22.520 align:middle line:84%
normal as human beings, they are
all here to do benevolent work.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.500 align:middle line:90%
They're all healers.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.450 align:middle line:90%
They're all psychics.

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:27.739 align:middle line:90%
They teach workshops.

00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:30.197 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that fascinating
how they've all come and do

00:45:30.197 --> 00:45:31.400 align:middle line:90%
things to help other people?

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yeah.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, the
extraterrestrial beings who

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:40.700 align:middle line:84%
added the hybrid or
genetics to the hybrids,

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:45.350 align:middle line:84%
they do that because those
beings, themselves, would not

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:49.550 align:middle line:84%
be able to survive very
long if they came to Earth.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So they can't
personally come and do

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:57.470 align:middle line:84%
the work to help humanity that
they would like to have happen,

00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:02.000 align:middle line:84%
but they can do it by
creating these hybrids who

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.190 align:middle line:90%
will go ahead and do that work.

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barbara, you
know Jim Gilliland, right?

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:07.023 align:middle line:90%
You've heard of him.

00:46:07.023 --> 00:46:10.240 align:middle line:84%
He's got a ranch up
in the upper northwest

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.911 align:middle line:84%
that he claims is visited
by UFOs all the time.

00:46:14.911 --> 00:46:16.660 align:middle line:10%
>>JIM GILLILAND: I
think the common thread

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.730 align:middle line:10%
between all of the
masters and the ETs

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:23.140 align:middle line:10%
as well because they're giving
the same messages that all

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:26.590 align:middle line:10%
of the masters have been
giving for thousands of years,

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:34.420 align:middle line:10%
and it follows under
the understandings

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.150 align:middle line:10%
that there is no
separation in omnipresence,

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:39.010 align:middle line:10%
that we're all connected.

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:40.510 align:middle line:84%
We all came from
the same source.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:43.780 align:middle line:84%
We all go back to the same
source, and all of the masters

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.100 align:middle line:90%
have given us this message.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
messages were inspired

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.730 align:middle line:84%
by the ETs over the past and
then got twisted and warped

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:54.130 align:middle line:90%
by kings and institutions.

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But the main message right now
that they're giving us is they

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.420 align:middle line:84%
are very concerned
with our consciousness

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.720 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth and our primitive,
aggressive, warlike nature.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.760 align:middle line:90%
They want us to let that go.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.960 align:middle line:84%
They want us to release the
past because these old grudges

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and old belief systems are
what is creating our tomorrow

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and what is creating the wars
and all of the other problems

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:18.730 align:middle line:90%
that we're having.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:21.550 align:middle line:84%
They want us to stop with
the greed and the competition

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and start cooperating
and working together.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:84%
We have a golden
opportunity right now

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.770 align:middle line:84%
to join the rest of
the universe in peace

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and to unite with
these beings that

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.490 align:middle line:84%
are extremely spiritually
and technologically advanced,

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:39.050 align:middle line:84%
far beyond anything
we can imagine.

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And they can assist us to
transcend war and disease

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.270 align:middle line:90%
and clean up our environment.

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's the ultimate
goal, that's our goal here

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:53.960 align:middle line:84%
at ECETI, to bridge the gap
and to rise to the occasion,

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.110 align:middle line:84%
so we can have these
contacts and can

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:59.210 align:middle line:90%
share in this information.

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And that is our whole goal,
and take this information

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and disseminate it out
to humanity of the Earth

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:09.410 align:middle line:84%
to help us in our own
quantum leap in consciousness

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:10.626 align:middle line:90%
and evolution.

00:48:10.626 --> 00:48:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of his assessment?

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: I think
that's fantastic.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.130 align:middle line:90%
I completely agree.

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And more and more of the
people who are coming to me

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:24.200 align:middle line:84%
have that understanding
from the beings

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.767 align:middle line:84%
that they have
interactions with.

00:48:27.767 --> 00:48:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: It is true.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I am convinced that there are
so many different civilizations

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:38.390 align:middle line:84%
out there that are
very benevolent.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:middle line:84%
They know so much more about
us than we know about them.

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
think we're the cookbook

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.590 align:middle line:84%
recipe as "The Twilight
Zone" depicted?

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: No.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:51.220 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.430 align:middle line:90%
I remember that episode.

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "To Serve Man."

00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: No, I've seen
no indication that they

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:02.330 align:middle line:84%
take humans and cook them and
eat them or anything like that.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's hope not.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: No.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, I certainly--

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.020 align:middle line:84%
I've done so many
regressions now.

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Almost 2,000 people
have regressed

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.400 align:middle line:84%
to extraterrestrial
experiences, and some of them

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.100 align:middle line:84%
have done many
regressions with me.

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.260 align:middle line:90%
So that's a lot of regressions.

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.567 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, almost 4,000 regressions.

00:49:23.567 --> 00:49:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After the
regressions though, Barb,

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.030 align:middle line:84%
after they're done, has
this changed the individual

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:30.350 align:middle line:90%
that you've regressed?

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:32.293 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how so?

00:49:32.293 --> 00:49:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: It does change
the individuals.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:38.060 align:middle line:90%
They grow in understanding.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.490 align:middle line:90%
They grow in openness.

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:43.010 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
more about the beings.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, It's almost
like becoming friends

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.300 align:middle line:84%
with new people in
having the regressions

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and realizing how they have
been helped by these beings.

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they constantly
checked by the ETs?

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Do they come back again?

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Very typically, a person is
visited quite a number of times

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.760 align:middle line:90%
over the period of the lifetime.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they ever stop?

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Some people,
whom I've worked

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.570 align:middle line:84%
with for many
regressions, when they

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:21.720 align:middle line:84%
get to be in their late
50s, maybe early 60s,

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.980 align:middle line:84%
they express that they're not
having the visits anymore,

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and interestingly, a lot
of them really miss that.

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.030 align:middle line:84%
They get accustomed
to it, don't they.

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yeah, and they
get to, over the years,

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:39.020 align:middle line:84%
sort of know the
beings to some extent.

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people
actually have what

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:45.180 align:middle line:84%
they consider a
lifelong relationship

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:49.200 align:middle line:84%
with a particular
extraterrestrial whom they've

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.360 align:middle line:90%
seen in most of their visits.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Billy Meier does.

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Billy Meier,
yes, definitely does.

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He has this regular one
that comes back all the time.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yeah.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And some of my clients have had
one particular extraterrestrial

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:09.350 align:middle line:84%
being whom they consider
a lifelong mentor.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've given
whole lectures

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.540 align:middle line:84%
on this kind of connection
that some people

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.540 align:middle line:84%
have with a particular
extraterrestrial.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barbara, what
would you say is happening?

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:23.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these are wild things--

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:26.570 align:middle line:90%
visitations, healings.

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:28.340 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
the bottom line is?

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.330 align:middle line:90%
What's the agenda here?

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, I think there
are many different agendas,

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:38.720 align:middle line:84%
but the overall one is that
beings out there in space,

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.470 align:middle line:84%
whom we may know about or may
not know about, they are very,

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:46.707 align:middle line:90%
very interested in this planet--

00:51:46.707 --> 00:51:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wonder why?

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --and in humanity.

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:49.858 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we that special?

00:51:49.858 --> 00:51:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, one of
the extraterrestrials

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:55.250 align:middle line:84%
told my clients,
and this came out

00:51:55.250 --> 00:52:00.860 align:middle line:84%
in channeling that she did,
this extraterrestrial said

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:09.260 align:middle line:84%
that Earth is a unique planet
among all the planets in all

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.370 align:middle line:84%
of the solar systems,
all of the universes,

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:17.030 align:middle line:84%
because we have
more species of life

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:23.180 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth than all
of the other planets

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.770 align:middle line:90%
have species put together.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Combined?

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:29.247 align:middle line:84%
We have more on this
one small planet.

00:52:29.247 --> 00:52:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're the
hodgepodge of everything.

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yeah, and when
you think about it,

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:38.510 align:middle line:84%
we do have species and
subspecies and sub-subspecies.

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:40.200 align:middle line:90%
And oh, my goodness.

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.000 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
wondered that, though.

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:43.090 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:46.927 align:middle line:84%
We have the insect world, the
animal world, the human world.

00:52:46.927 --> 00:52:48.260 align:middle line:90%
There's so many-- the fish life.

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: The ocean world.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we do.

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.750 align:middle line:84%
The mammals, the
reptiles, the amphibians--

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:59.180 align:middle line:84%
it goes on and on and on, so
that's one of the reasons.

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Also, the Earth itself
has so many different

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:06.930 align:middle line:84%
features that a lot of
the planets don't have.

00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:08.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have our oceans.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.030 align:middle line:90%
We have our lakes, our rivers--

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't have this?

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --our
mountains, our minerals.

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:17.780 align:middle line:84%
We are rich in minerals that
some of the other planets

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:21.390 align:middle line:84%
don't have or don't
have as much as we do.

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
interested in humans.

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:32.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons is because
we have so much more emotional

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.630 align:middle line:84%
capability than most of the
other beings in existence.

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're a psychologist's
biggest nightmare.

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: [LAUGHS] Right.

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you really
think about it,

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:52.310 align:middle line:84%
any one person can experience
joy and humor, laughter,

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:58.250 align:middle line:84%
lightness, depression,
grief, depravity.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:00.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we run the gamut.

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Anger-- humans
are quick to anger

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:07.190 align:middle line:90%
and quick to get frustrated.

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:13.460 align:middle line:84%
The other species don't seem
to have emotions in that range.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.779 align:middle line:84%
Some of them don't seem
to have emotions at all.

00:54:15.779 --> 00:54:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes I wonder
if that's not better.

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yeah, yes.

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:21.680 align:middle line:84%
But they're quite
intrigued with that,

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and they know that we have
a lot of complications

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.700 align:middle line:84%
in our lives because
of our emotions.

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had a
contactee, Barb, break down

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:33.410 align:middle line:90%
and cry, just lose it?

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: No, no, I haven't.

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:38.170 align:middle line:84%
That's an interesting
thought, but no.

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:38.263 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:54:38.263 --> 00:54:38.770 align:middle line:84%
You would think that they would
with that kind of experience.

00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: That hasn't happened.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But they do sometimes come
out of the regression feeling

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:48.760 align:middle line:84%
really deeply
moved and sometimes

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:55.840 align:middle line:84%
feel grateful that they're being
watched over, guided by some

00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:00.200 align:middle line:84%
of these beings, healed
by some of the beings,

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and just that they're a part
of this whole, huge enormous

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:08.740 align:middle line:84%
project going on of
different life forms

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.820 align:middle line:84%
interacting with
other life forms.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had
a ET experience yourself?

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yes, I've had
four that I'm aware of.

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Four?

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yeah.

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us an
example of one of them.

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:20.399 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: They've all
been very different.

00:55:20.399 --> 00:55:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Same beings
that come and see you?

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: No.

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:25.490 align:middle line:84%
They've all been
different beings.

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So one of them was
my car and I were

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:34.420 align:middle line:84%
abducted from one of
the major freeways

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:38.950 align:middle line:84%
in Southern California
at midnight one night.

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And the car and I were
taken up in a beam of light.

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I had no expectation
of anything like that.

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:51.730 align:middle line:90%
It was a complete surprise.

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:52.660 align:middle line:90%
And I found--

00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I knew that something very
strange was happening,

00:55:57.010 --> 00:56:03.470 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know the details of
it until I had Dolores Cannon--

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The late Dolores.

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yeah.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I miss her.

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.224 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Oh, I miss her too.

00:56:07.224 --> 00:56:08.400 align:middle line:90%
We were good friends.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, Dolores Cannon
regressed me two times

00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:17.110 align:middle line:84%
to the same experience
because the main being

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:22.720 align:middle line:84%
in that experience was
giving us so much information

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.700 align:middle line:90%
about his group of beings.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:29.000 align:middle line:90%
And it was really fascinating.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So all of my experiences
were very good experiences,

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.020 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion, very positive.

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.002 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful for
having had had them.

00:56:39.002 --> 00:56:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're an
enlightened person, Barbara.

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.040 align:middle line:90%
You're a good person.

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:45.200 align:middle line:84%
You can obviously tell
you've got a heart of gold.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.937 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't your
experiences be pleasant?

00:56:47.937 --> 00:56:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Why wouldn't
they be pleasant?

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.619 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah I mean,
because you're a good person.

00:56:52.619 --> 00:56:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Why would they not be pleasant?

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Oh, right.

00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, it just seemed that they
were very appropriate for me.

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:02.490 align:middle line:90%
They were all about learning.

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:05.680 align:middle line:84%
I was grateful for the
learning and grateful to have

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.060 align:middle line:90%
contact with them.

00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the main
reason for their taking

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:14.050 align:middle line:84%
me, this being said, was
they had put an apparatus

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:18.610 align:middle line:84%
like a metal helmet, it
looked like, over my head.

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And they were running
a current through it.

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're probably
wondering what we're doing,

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:27.970 align:middle line:84%
which, of course,
I was wondering.

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said we are downloading
information from your brain,

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:39.250 align:middle line:84%
because we know that you work
with many, many people who

00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:44.410 align:middle line:84%
experience beings from
other parts of the universe.

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
you find out a lot

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:50.240 align:middle line:90%
about that from these people.

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And we want to
know what you know.

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So Dolores, in conducting
the regression,

00:57:57.730 --> 00:58:03.110 align:middle line:84%
said Barbara, ask him what
they do with this information?

00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:05.470 align:middle line:90%
And he said, we broadcast it.

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And Dolores said,
Barbara, ask him [LAUGHS]

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:12.580 align:middle line:90%
how they broadcast it?

00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
we pick up one

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.530 align:middle line:84%
of the signals
that you have here,

00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and we broadcast on
that signal like you

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:27.010 align:middle line:84%
do with your television
set, your radio broadcasts.

00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And she said, ask him who
listens to those broadcasts?

00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
other beings who

00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:37.330 align:middle line:84%
come from other parts
of the universe who

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:40.660 align:middle line:90%
care about this information.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:44.020 align:middle line:10%
Many other beings don't
care about humans and what

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:48.130 align:middle line:10%
they experience with the
other beings but some of them

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:49.390 align:middle line:10%
really do.

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So they will tune in, like you
tune in a radio or a television

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.547 align:middle line:90%
to that particular signal.

00:58:55.547 --> 00:58:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And learn
something about us.

00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: And learn what
they want to learn.

00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barbara, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Thank you.

00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:01.840 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you think
you're a contactee,

00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.620 align:middle line:90%
she's the one to go to.

00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:06.760 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:11.990 align:middle line:90%
