00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL MCKENNA: The
technique is that you

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.640 align:middle line:84%
enter into a state of gratitude,
a gratitude for everything.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Everything that happens.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: In the
fifth dimension,

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:84%
it is a state where you're
in a state of bliss,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle line:84%
you're in your heart, and there
becomes very little difference

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.305 align:middle line:90%
in between you and me.

00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:10%
Bill McKenna is with us, the
author of "The Only Lesson"

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.230 align:middle line:10%
and founder of the
Cognomovement where

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.410 align:middle line:10%
he teaches simple, quick
techniques to better

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:10%
the human experience and reach
into the fourth and fifth

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:10%
dimensions, Bill, right?

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're going to
talk about these dimensions

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:90%
and what they are.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.680 align:middle line:90%
How have you been?

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Great, great.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.533 align:middle line:84%
Such an honor to be
with you, George.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Likewise, likewise.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:90%
What is Cognomovement?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: Cognomovement
is a modality

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:17.130 align:middle line:10%
that I developed that causes
an emotional amnesia or craving

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.710 align:middle line:10%
amnesia, these sorts of things
where people no longer feel

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:10%
the way they feel.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:84%
We also use it for many other
purposes to solve, really,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.720 align:middle line:90%
life's most difficult problems.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it spiritual?

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Supernatural?

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: No, no, not at all.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
What it is, we have
found a way to exploit

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
a natural neurological
response that our bodies have.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
So we have a person
focus on a problem,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and then we do
particular movements.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And with that, it causes
these problems to go away.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give me an example.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, let's just say
that you've gotten a divorce

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and something's happened
horribly or a death

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:90%
of somebody--

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.913 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something tragic.

00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Something tragic.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
What happens is,
we have the person

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
to let them feel how they
feel, feel their resentment,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.403 align:middle line:90%
feel their pain.

00:02:22.403 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And their
bitterness, whatever it is.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Feel all of that.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, we move
their body in a certain ways.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And it causes them to have new
epiphanies, new perspectives,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and a release of it
in the physical body.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
They actually feel a
sensation in the body

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.040 align:middle line:90%
of this actually leaving.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can
feel this change.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get started in this?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Well, I started--

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's story
behind this somehow.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had no
intention, first of all,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:84%
to go on the journey
of creating a modality.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.640 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was,
I went through kind

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:84%
of a very abrupt
spiritual awakening

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:90%
back in around 2007 or so.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I began to study
many different modalities.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
When the student is
ready, the master appears.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:90%
And that happened to me.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:90%
It really-- in spades.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And I started helping people
and figuring out what worked

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.857 align:middle line:90%
and what didn't work.

00:03:33.857 --> 00:03:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the
introduction, I talked

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
about the fourth dimension,
the fifth dimension.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:90%
How many dimensions are there?

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I believe there's
unlimited number of dimensions.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that we're
really concerned with today

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:84%
are the third, the
fourth, and the fifth

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and how we can,
with the information

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that we were going
to give today,

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
find a simple method of actually
being able to bend time itself.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
What dimension
does the humankind

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:84%
seem to be predominantly
residing in?

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The predominant
one is the third dimension,

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and this dimension
is one where you

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:84%
have certain type of features
and aspects to it-- facets,

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle line:84%
In the third dimension,
we are in a constant state

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:84%
of either wanting something,
not getting what we want,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:90%
or we're indifferent.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Predominantly, we find
ourselves in a state

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
of one of the lower emotions--
shame, guilt. The big one

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.278 align:middle line:84%
right now is anxiety,
fear, and anger.

00:04:54.278 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's everywhere.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.445 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's everywhere.

00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:58.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the predominant
emotion on the planet.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are we
looking at here, Bill?

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: What we're looking at
is my map of awareness levels.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You created this?

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:10%
And with this,
MOAL, what we have

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:10%
is divided out into the third,
fourth, and fifth dimensions.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you can expect
within those dimensions?

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:10%
Time will behave a certain way.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:10%
You'll have a particular
focus in these dimensions.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
The different facets
of these dimensions

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.350 align:middle line:84%
are explained in this map
of levels of awareness.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And they are affecting
everything from time itself

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:84%
to our ability to
manifest things.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I notice
ego was up there.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, our ego.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So in the third dimension,
for example, our ego

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
either is not getting what
it wants or it's indifferent.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is evident
in all of our lives.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Just a simple trip down
the street, and you'll

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
find yourself either wanting
something from someone

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.735 align:middle line:84%
or not getting what you
want as an experience.

00:06:16.735 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always
thought ego was good,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
but I hear from so many other
people that ego is bad for us.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Who's right?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, I don't
think it's a bad thing.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.697 align:middle line:90%
It is your personality.

00:06:28.697 --> 00:06:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's who you are.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It is who you
are, to a certain extent.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:84%
We take on a personality when
we come here to the earth.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And with that, we're going
to learn certain lessons.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our very
own Regina Meredith,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
she's interviewed you
before on her program.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And she interviewed Jim Self on
the "Conscious Media Network"

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.625 align:middle line:84%
to talk about some
of these dimensions.

00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:10%
>>JIM SELF: This thing
called dimensions

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:10%
is a very interesting aspect.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.300 align:middle line:10%
Let's start with this third
dimension, which I'm saying

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.620 align:middle line:10%
is dissolving.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.730 align:middle line:10%
It's going away.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:10%
Well, the dimension is not
the chair we're sitting in,

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:10%
the house that surrounds us,
the tree outside the window.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:10%
That's form.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:10%
That's physical form.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:22.000 align:middle line:10%
But what this third dimension
is is a very dense reality,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:10%
and it's very structured.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:10%
It's conditional.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing in the third
dimension that's unconditional.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:10%
You have to get into
the fourth and fifth

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:10%
before you experience
unconditional, so conditional.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:10%
It's very rigid.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:10%
There's not a lot of flexibility
in this third dimension.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.890 align:middle line:10%
It deals in things like always.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.970 align:middle line:10%
She's never going
to be trustworthy.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:10%
I can never allow.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:10%
He always is going
to be this or that.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:10%
See, there's no flexibility
in that very rigid.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:10%
There's also a component
in the third dimension that

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:10%
keeps us very much in
the third dimension,

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.130 align:middle line:10%
and that's how we
understand time.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:10%
Time is a very
fascinating thing.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:10%
Time is an application.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:10%
It's not a fixed creation.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:10%
So in the third dimension,
the time that we play in

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.200 align:middle line:10%
is called past, present,
future, and then you die.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:10%
But if you look around and you
listen to people speaking, what

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:10%
you hear them talking
about is not present time,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:10%
but this happened to
me once upon a time

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:10%
and I hope it never
happens to me again,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:10%
or they said if I would,
therefore I will be.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:10%
So when you listen to
people, very seldom

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:10%
do you hear them
speaking in present time

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:10%
in a third-dimensional reality.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
How do you get through
these dimensions?

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Is it voluntary or involuntary?

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Well, both.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:84%
As a species, we're
moving presently

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:84%
from the third to
the fourth dimension.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we
migrate is actually

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:84%
by processing all of
those unwanted emotions.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we want to be
stuck in the third dimension?

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, the third
dimension has certain benefits.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
benefits is time itself.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, in the
third dimension, here

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:90%
we have linear time.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
There are 60 seconds in a minute
and 60 minutes in an hour.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And with this, what happens
is, we get to change our mind.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
We get to experience
things very, very slowly.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I can evaluate with
time how maybe I

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:84%
want to try on
forgiveness, for example,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:90%
or change my perspective.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth dimension, time
becomes malleable and speeds

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.780 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And in the fifth dimension,
time is instantaneous creation.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly
is the fourth dimension?

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So in
the third dimension

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.070 align:middle line:90%
is the home of conditional love.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
As Jim Self was
saying, everything

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.950 align:middle line:84%
is conditional-- laws, rules,
regulations, yours, mine.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:84%
All the institutions really
thrive in this dimension

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:90%
because they're all rule based.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.185 align:middle line:90%
Even religions are rule based.

00:10:31.185 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So in the fourth dimension,
it is a migration

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:90%
to unconditional love.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And when we are in that
state of unconditional love,

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:55.080 align:middle line:84%
then what happens is time, for
example, becomes malleable.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
But there are aspects
of unconditional love--

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:90%
gratitude being one of them.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barbara Hand
Clow, just an amazing guest

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:84%
on all programs, including
Gaia's "Open Minds," talks

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:90%
about the fourth dimension.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.372 align:middle line:90%
Let's get your reaction to that.

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA HAND CLOW:
The fourth dimension

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%
isn't even number number 4.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:10%
And then the sixth dimension
isn't eighth dimension.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:10%
And so in my system,
the higher guides

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.620 align:middle line:10%
are actually coming
from the sixth dimension

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:10%
and the eighth dimension.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.380 align:middle line:10%
And then just like anything
else, in order to get to us

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:10%
and to communicate with
us and connect with us,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.680 align:middle line:10%
they have to go through
the fourth dimension.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:10%
So what happens is,
beings that are actually

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:10%
of very high
consciousness are often

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:10%
will come through and be
described as religious figures.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.990 align:middle line:10%
In other words, you pick up
on something you think is God.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:10%
But what we're missing is
the really high frequency

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.947 align:middle line:10%
and high fine dimensionality,
a really divine consciousness.

00:11:55.947 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: And do
they have to essentially lower

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:10%
their frequencies and
their presences to be able

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.190 align:middle line:10%
to communicate with us--

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:10%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: They don't.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:10%
What happens is, you or I,
we're running the frequency

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:10%
of the fourth dimension.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:10%
So if your consciousness
is really high, then

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.310 align:middle line:10%
when a divine being
wants to contact you,

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.310 align:middle line:10%
it just moves right
through you and right

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:10%
through the fourth dimension or
right into the third dimension.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:10%
And if you got a really
divine inspiration,

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.840 align:middle line:10%
you wouldn't tend to interpret
it as Yahweh or Jehovah.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:10%
But millions of
people on the planet,

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:10%
if they get any kind of
impulse of higher energy,

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.410 align:middle line:10%
they would think
that as Jehovah.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, is there
chronology to these dimensions?

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.220 align:middle line:90%
You go through the third.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:90%
You go through the fourth.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Are they steps?

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, that's
an awesome question.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:90%
They are steps.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you leapfrog?

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: What happens
is, if you leapfrog,

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:90%
the things that are on process--

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:84%
let's say, that I did
not process certain fears

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:90%
or desires--

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:84%
what happens is, you'll end
up eventually coming back down

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:90%
in order to process that.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about anxieties?

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:84%
What dimension would
they be hanging around?

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, those are going
to be in the third dimension.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
things that keep us

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.820 align:middle line:84%
from being able to do
this technique that I'm

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:39.345 align:middle line:84%
going to show to actually
bend time itself.

00:13:39.345 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Now as you go
through dimensions,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
are you getting a
little more perfected?

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
If you go from three to four,
four to five, five to six,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.940 align:middle line:90%
do you get better at things?

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, yes.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
natural phenomenon

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.330 align:middle line:84%
that happens as you go
through the dimensions.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You can expect, when you're
in the third dimension,

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.770 align:middle line:84%
to experience a
lot of separation.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:14.410 align:middle line:84%
You can experience a lot
of difficulty in life.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:84%
As you graduate and
move through the aspects

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:90%
of the fourth dimension--

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness, appreciation,
love, unconditional love--

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:84%
taking you up through
it, what happens

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.970 align:middle line:84%
is, your life gets
better and better.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
In certain points,
you will actually

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:84%
start to release your
judgments and your assumptions.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And with that, genius starts
to emerge quite naturally.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What gets you
into these dimensions?

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:90%
How do you do it?

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:90%
How do I go from three to four?

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So I'm going to show
you how to actually do that.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
One easy way to do it is to
be in a state of gratitude.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you are in a state of
gratitude, all of a sudden,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:84%
you can't be in a
state of gratitude

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and also in fear
at the same time.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I can't be in a
state of gratitude

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and then start judging
you at the same time.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So gratitude
would be, thanks, Bill.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.840 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming on the show.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.695 align:middle line:90%
Well, is that gratitude?

00:15:30.695 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That's it.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.920 align:middle line:90%
That's a form of gratitude.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And you can extend
this to everything.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:41.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful that my lungs
are breathing really good right

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.250 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful that my
digestion is working.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful that
we have electricity

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
in this building that allows
all the camera people to do

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.540 align:middle line:90%
what they need to do.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.163 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful for
the Gaia network.

00:15:54.163 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're everywhere.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, yeah.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many things
to be grateful for right here,

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:90%
right now as we sit here.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is manifestation?

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So manifesting--
and we're constantly in a state

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.550 align:middle line:90%
of doing it--

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:84%
is whatever you're
wanting or not wanting,

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're feeling
attracts a certain reality.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a magnet.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Like a
magnet, exactly.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you attract bad
things, as well as good things?

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: We all do.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's true.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And if you want to
know what you're manifesting,

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:90%
look at your life.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
get rid of the bad?

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So one way
to get rid of the bad

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
is to cognomovement,
for example,

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.230 align:middle line:90%
to process your subconscious.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So the way it works is,
when we are children,

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:84%
when we're young children
from the ages of zero to seven

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
we're in a brainwave
state called theta.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:08.869 align:middle line:84%
This is the same brainwave
state that we put people

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:90%
into hypnotized.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a great
age too, by the way.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.442 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, isn't it?

00:17:12.442 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very formative.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's exactly that.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:84%
It's when you get programmed
because your brainwave state is

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:84%
in that state where it accepts
whatever it's being told.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And so with this, you
get your belief system.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Our belief system,
our subconscious

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:84%
expresses itself through the
physical body as a feeling.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happens is we think

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
thoughts equal to the
feeling that we're feeling.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.230 align:middle line:84%
With this, we manifest
whatever is in our life.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know what's
in your subconscious,

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:90%
look at your reality.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So your question was, how
do we get rid of that?

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you eradicate?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: How do
you eradicate it?

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, with
Cognomovement, you allow

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:90%
yourself to feel that way.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I feel like money is bad,
or only bad people have money.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Let yourself feel that.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And you do this
process and poof,

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:90%
you no longer feel that way.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:10%
So it's a form of
basically eradicating

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.990 align:middle line:10%
these unwanted beliefs
out of the subconscious.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's the
movement from third to fourth?

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good thing?

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So you can make an active choice
to move to the fourth dimension

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:46.950 align:middle line:90%
by forgiving, appreciating--

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Loving.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --letting
go of your judgments,

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:90%
letting go of your assumptions.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
happens automatically?

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:84%
This movement into
the fourth dimension?

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It'll automatically happen if
we actually automatically move

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:90%
in between the dimensions.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
between dimensions?

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: In between
the dimensions,

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:90%
it's like a gradient.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it like limbo?

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: No, it's a gradient,
kind of like a rainbow.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not snap.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not like there's
a definitive line.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not three.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.375 align:middle line:90%
It's not four.

00:19:21.375 --> 00:19:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's in between.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:84%
It'll slowly merge in
between three to four

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:90%
and then back down.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a state of bliss?

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So the fifth
dimension is a state of bliss.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Our attention goes
into different places

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:90%
with different dimensions.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the
third dimension,

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:48.820 align:middle line:84%
we're mostly concerned
with money, sex, power.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three primary you
have an attraction or aversion.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.170 align:middle line:84%
There's some strong
emotion there.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth dimension,
your attention

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:84%
starts to go to intuition
and spirituality.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
start to notice where

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:90%
is my attention in my body.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:84%
It'll help to be another
indicator of where you're at.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth dimension where
things manifest instantly,

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.450 align:middle line:90%
you're in your heart.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it sounds
like the higher you go,

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.678 align:middle line:90%
the better off you are.

00:20:23.678 --> 00:20:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: To a certain extent.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is yes.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.850 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension is training
wheels to get into the fifth.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:84%
We are letting go of all of
those negative experiences

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and feelings that we
had from the third.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.672 align:middle line:84%
You'll find yourself
slipping up.

00:20:46.672 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
You may be in a
state of gratitude,

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.410 align:middle line:84%
you're doing really good,
and then something happens

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.475 align:middle line:90%
and you dip down to the--

00:20:51.475 --> 00:20:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly
is the fifth dimension?

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: In the
fifth dimension,

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.700 align:middle line:84%
what it is is just
another feeling.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.780 align:middle line:84%
It is a state where you're
in a state of bliss,

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:10.550 align:middle line:84%
you're in your heart, and there
becomes very little difference

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:90%
in between you and me.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:18.950 align:middle line:84%
We're operating in cooperation
and not competition anymore.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And what I see in
my best interest

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.600 align:middle line:90%
is to love you completely.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:84%
That's when we get into that
state and we're in our heart

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:90%
and we're actually feeling it.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, things
happen very, very quickly,

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously, which sounds
really good until you're

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
in that bliss state and then
something negative happens

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and you react to it and boom,
just like that, it happens.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.150 align:middle line:84%
I had a guy, one of
my students, and he

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.710 align:middle line:90%
had a boat, a little boat.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:04.665 align:middle line:84%
And he went out on the
bay with a Buddhist monk.

00:22:04.665 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what he's doing.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: I know.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.590 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
But that was a bunch
of his friends.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.320 align:middle line:84%
He's out on the
water, on the bay,

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and they decide, of
all things, oh, we're

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:90%
going to meditate here.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So he's with this Buddhist monk
on his boat, the little boat,

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and they're just meditating for
like an hour, the two of them,

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:90%
in this bliss state.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And then, the
hour's up, he gets up,

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and he turns the--
he turns the key.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:90%
And it [MOTOR SOUND].

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.660 align:middle line:90%
The battery--

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's dead.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: The battery's dead.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:90%
So he's like--

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.272 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They drained it.

00:22:42.272 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Well, he got upset.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:84%
He's like, he had just
gotten the boat fixed.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And there he is.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:84%
He turns the key again,
and he's angry now.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.090 align:middle line:84%
[MOTOR SOUND] And
[EXPLOSION SOUND] the engine

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.890 align:middle line:90%
caught on fire.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Just like that.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And so there's many
stories about when

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:84%
you're in that state, and then
something negative happens.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he create the
negativity, in your opinion?

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It was a reaction.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.970 align:middle line:84%
It was something in him
that wasn't healed yet.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.130 align:middle line:90%
And he just he had a reaction.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:84%
He dropped down to the third
dimension and got angry.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And then the material world
will respond directly to it.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, Matías De Stefano
hosts a program on Gaia called

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.440 align:middle line:84%
"Initiation," and he shares his
experiences traveling through

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.873 align:middle line:90%
these dimensions.

00:23:33.873 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:10%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO:
When you connect yourself

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:10%
with a fifth dimension, you
have to feel unconditional love

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:10%
to understand what love means.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:47.790 align:middle line:10%
Unconditional is that you are
just aware that your self has

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:10%
created everything
around, so love is just

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:10%
the expression that
has created all this.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:58.560 align:middle line:10%
Dimensions are different ways
of consciousness in which

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:10%
you observe one reality.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:10%
That's why you don't go
to the fifth dimension.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:06.030 align:middle line:10%
You achieve fifth dimension.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.440 align:middle line:10%
You feel fifth dimension.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.510 align:middle line:10%
So if you don't feel incoherence
from the third dimension, then

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.350 align:middle line:10%
unconditional love, it will be
very difficult to understand

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:10%
the fifth dimension because
in the fifth dimension,

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:10%
love is just one.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.440 align:middle line:10%
It's not separated by chakras.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.090 align:middle line:10%
So you cannot hate or love.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:10%
You just love
everything as it is.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:10%
That's why in the
fifth dimension

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.790 align:middle line:10%
doesn't exist judgment.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:39.210 align:middle line:10%
So if you, in your heart,
have a little bit of judgment

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:44.977 align:middle line:10%
for someone or something, so it
will be really difficult to you

00:24:44.977 --> 00:24:47.820 align:middle line:10%
to see the fifth dimension.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had to
stay in a dimension,

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.382 align:middle line:90%
which one would you choose?

00:24:51.382 --> 00:24:52.215 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, gosh.

00:24:52.215 --> 00:24:54.303 align:middle line:90%
I-- You know what--

00:24:54.303 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't, can you?

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well,
actually you can.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:84%
You can make the choice to
stay in whatever dimension

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:90%
that you want.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:04.942 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But which one
would it be for you?

00:25:04.942 --> 00:25:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: For me,
I'm most comfortable

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:90%
in the high fourth dimension.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And the reason being
is that I have not

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:19.560 align:middle line:90%
mastered every emotion.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:84%
In order to be in the fifth
dimension successfully,

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
you need to master every
emotion because as I think--

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: --boom, it creates.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:84%
A funny story-- it was
Christmas Eve many years ago,

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and when I was there, I called
my wife early in the morning.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I was at work, and I was like,
it's like 9 o'clock or so,

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.148 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, hey, I'm
going to pick up our daughter.

00:25:48.148 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And getting out early.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I'm getting out early
and to pick up our daughter.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.760 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go and choose
your Christmas present.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to
go to the mall and--

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't
wait too long, did you?

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Christmas Eve.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: [LAUGHING]
That's when I shop.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:90%
I shop on Christmas Eve.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But I know I got to
get to the mall early.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.033 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Before it closes.

00:26:06.033 --> 00:26:07.825 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, not
only before it closes,

00:26:07.825 --> 00:26:09.840 align:middle line:84%
but the malls get so
crowded with the cars--

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:90%
can't get parking.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Last minute rushes.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, so that's
me, last minute rusher.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I'm
on the phone with her.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, hey, you know
I'm going to pick her up.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.670 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, no.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wait,
what do you mean no?

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I've got to wash her hair
before you pick her up.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well,
no, no, no, no.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I need to because the mall
and the cars and the parking

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.020 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And she-- nope, nope, nope.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh, I'm
starting to get frustrated.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:39.570 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.180 align:middle line:90%
I was like, fine.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll go have an early lunch,
and then I'll pick her up after.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:90%
So I'm there.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.710 align:middle line:84%
I go to a Mexican
restaurant, angry,

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.458 align:middle line:90%
eating a burrito to myself.

00:26:51.458 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not good.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I pull up, and
I walk in the door.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's my wife, and
she's like, well, you

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.630 align:middle line:90%
want to see what you did?

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, what did I do?

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And she walks me
into the bathroom,

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and we have this little
tub for-- little child tub

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.710 align:middle line:84%
that one of those spray
handles that you stick it down

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.042 align:middle line:90%
in the tub and turn on.

00:27:18.042 --> 00:27:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, she stuck it
down in the tub,

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:84%
turned it on, and left
and forgot about it.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:90%
And the tub overflows.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.540 align:middle line:84%
No big deal if it goes
down in the drain.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: But this time, the
nozzle broke off the thing.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:29.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's like silly--

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:90%
it's like a silly hose.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's just like a snake.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And it flooded
the entire bathroom,

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and she couldn't do
the whole shower thing.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well,
anyway that was it.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.520 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't take a shower.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want her
to take a shower.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.850 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that the
front window broke,

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:84%
or I got a flat
tire or anything.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.200 align:middle line:90%
It was quite specifically that.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whose fault was that?

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, that'd be mine.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was your fault.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:27:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I hadn't mastered
that emotion yet.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So these are opportunities
though to consider

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:90%
changing your mind.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
gratitude mean to you?

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So what
gratitude means to me,

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.650 align:middle line:84%
the experience of it,
can be really anything.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a thought.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.160 align:middle line:90%
But it's obviously a thought--

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: But it's
really a feeling.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an emotion.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.545 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's an emotion.

00:28:34.545 --> 00:28:43.950 align:middle line:84%
If you can get into a state
of sincerely appreciating

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.520 align:middle line:90%
whatever is going on.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a good
state to be in, Bill?

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's a great state.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And it will help you to
stay in the fourth dimension

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:59.370 align:middle line:84%
where things will
manifest quickly.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:03.992 align:middle line:84%
And you can even
bend time itself.

00:29:03.992 --> 00:29:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that is the
fourth dimension, gratitude?

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.825 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: That's
the fourth dimension.

00:29:07.825 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many emotions are
there in the fourth dimension?

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Countless?

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, whatever
derivative of love.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:19.870 align:middle line:90%
So there would be many, many--

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:26.620 align:middle line:84%
appreciation, forgiveness,
acceptance, love.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.737 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gratitude is a
great feeling, by the way.

00:29:28.737 --> 00:29:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It is a good feeling.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To be able
to do that and be

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.900 align:middle line:90%
thankful for things and people.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:84%
It is a wonderful
feeling that has

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:84%
some additional benefits that
most people don't go along

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at Matías again,

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:90%
who talks about resistance.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:10%
>>DE STEFANO: Transcendence
for the universe

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.720 align:middle line:10%
has a good way and a
bad way to be released.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:05.380 align:middle line:10%
The good way is when you realize
that your reality is stuck,

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.800 align:middle line:10%
and you start to transform
your reality into another one.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.380 align:middle line:10%
And the bad way
to do that is when

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.970 align:middle line:10%
you are stuck in your
reality, but you say no, no, I

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:17.655 align:middle line:10%
don't want to change.

00:30:17.655 --> 00:30:19.030 align:middle line:10%
So when you don't
want to change,

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.690 align:middle line:10%
the whole vibration of
your body and your reality

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:27.010 align:middle line:10%
start to change you by force
because the main statement

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.070 align:middle line:10%
of the universe in the fifth
dimension is evolution.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:34.180 align:middle line:10%
If you don't change, so the
energy stuck, you get ill

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:10%
or there is a war.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:42.730 align:middle line:10%
So war and sickness, illness are
just the final product of you

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:46.220 align:middle line:10%
don't realizing that
you have to change.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So the world makes
you change by force.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you think?

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.120 align:middle line:90%
You agree with him?

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Absolutely.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And that reality plays
itself out really quick.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself like not
wanting to go to a meeting,

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.820 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of things will
start to happen, anything

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:84%
from illness to the car
not working, you name it,

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.220 align:middle line:84%
when you're in the
fifth dimension.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were going to
give us a technique on how

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.780 align:middle line:90%
to get into these dimensions.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.710 align:middle line:90%
You want to do that?

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, I'd love to.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:32.560 align:middle line:84%
So this one's very specifically
is all about bending time.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And the technique
is that you enter

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:42.495 align:middle line:84%
into a state of gratitude,
a gratitude for everything.

00:31:42.495 --> 00:31:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything
that happens.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:44.787 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Everything.

00:31:44.787 --> 00:31:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Your body, the sun, the
moon, everything else

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.855 align:middle line:90%
that is around--

00:31:49.855 --> 00:31:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your pay
raise, everything.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Everything.

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you can think
of and keep expanding it

00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:01.360 align:middle line:84%
to all the people around you
and the environment around you.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:84%
When you do that and you're
in a state of gratitude,

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.250 align:middle line:90%
you can set your intention.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, for example, with
this particular technique

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that I was going
to give you today

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.310 align:middle line:90%
is all around bending time.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Now time--

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
you say bending time,

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.870 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: OK, so
what that means--

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you the example
of what happened to me.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I understood
the third, fourth,

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:90%
and fifth dimensions.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I made the same
trip for many, many years

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.360 align:middle line:84%
from San Diego to Riverside,
and it was a one hour 45 minute

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.160 align:middle line:90%
trip.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not bad.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Not bad.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Not bad.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: California
traffic not bad.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Not bad at all.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.700 align:middle line:90%
It was every Saturday.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So I would leave at 8:15
and be there at 10 o'clock.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.390 align:middle line:90%
What happened--

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clockwork.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Like clockwork
because I put the cruise

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.530 align:middle line:90%
control on 70 miles an hour.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't get no
tickets, and off I went.

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So this particular
day, we ended up

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.420 align:middle line:84%
getting out of the
house half an hour late.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, on top of that,
I didn't have any gas,

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.930 align:middle line:84%
so I did stop at
the gas station.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So I've refueled, now
we're about an hour--

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, about 40 minutes late.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that important here?

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
that's important

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:34.250 align:middle line:84%
because I got on the road,
and I was frustrated.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.430 align:middle line:90%
So I saw myself--

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tense.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --tense, and
I knew that was fear,

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and I knew it was
the third dimension.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
I thought, well,

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:48.237 align:middle line:84%
if this is the third dimension,
I'll be there at 10:40.

00:33:48.237 --> 00:33:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'll get there.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I'll get
there at 10:40, though,

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.210 align:middle line:90%
which is linear time.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about the
fourth dimension, which

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.820 align:middle line:90%
I knew that time was malleable.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, OK,
how do I do that?

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.210 align:middle line:90%
How would I get in?

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll feel gratitude.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.270 align:middle line:90%
And I began to feel gratitude.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.820 align:middle line:90%
I felt gratitude for everything.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.050 align:middle line:90%
And I also ignored the laws.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:15.170 align:middle line:84%
The laws, rules, and regulations
of the third dimension

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:84%
is linear time, that
means the clock.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So I completely ignored the
clock, and I set my intention.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be there at 9:55.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is I
just kept in the state

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:34.679 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude the entire
way, all the way up there.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I
turned on the blinker,

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and I'm pulling into
the driveway 9:55.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.469 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: That's 45
minutes that there's

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:90%
no way to account for it.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like you were
abducted or something.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.199 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, yes.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:55.340 align:middle line:84%
That's another place that time
really shifts is in abductions.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:35:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But the technique here to
enter into the fourth dimension

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.620 align:middle line:90%
is simply that.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:08.040 align:middle line:84%
All you have to
do is put yourself

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.950 align:middle line:84%
in a state of gratitude,
forget the laws

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:12.720 align:middle line:84%
of the third
dimension-- the clock,

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:18.330 align:middle line:84%
set your clear intention, and
do not look at that law again.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know, Bill,
that you're in that dimension?

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: When oddball
things start happening

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.740 align:middle line:90%
like what we just talked about.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing that you'll
know you're in that dimension

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.650 align:middle line:90%
is how you feel.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.150 align:middle line:84%
You have to ask
yourself, how do I--

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:38.858 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you should
feel good, right?

00:35:38.858 --> 00:35:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.380 align:middle line:84%
If I really feel good
is my mind looping

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.900 align:middle line:84%
on thoughts of aggravation,
of fear, of anxiety?

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say you and
I are in the fourth dimension

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.510 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: I'd say so.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:90%
I'd say so.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.360 align:middle line:90%
I feel real good.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you go to
five or six, then what?

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.550 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: Well,
what happens then

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:05.770 align:middle line:10%
is that everything
begins to morph,

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:14.680 align:middle line:10%
so the experience is odd
meaning that in those higher

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.670 align:middle line:10%
fifth dimension, you'll
see a person's body

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.820 align:middle line:10%
start to dissipate.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:23.620 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:24.842 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like the Star Trek.

00:36:24.842 --> 00:36:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Kind of like that.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:26.925 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Beam you up.

00:36:26.925 --> 00:36:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, it'll
actually start doing that.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite a
strange experience.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been in a dimension

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:39.720 align:middle line:90%
that you didn't want to be in?

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So there was,
obviously, the dream state.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:48.147 align:middle line:84%
There is something
called the lower fourth--

00:36:48.147 --> 00:36:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The lower astral plane.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.735 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, the
astral plane, and--

00:36:51.735 --> 00:36:53.027 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've heard about that.

00:36:53.027 --> 00:36:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --where
you have the--

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:59.730 align:middle line:84%
it's basically the
unmanifested fears of mankind.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The undesirables.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
the undesirable.

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:84%
All of those negative
thoughts, negative experiences

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.070 align:middle line:84%
collect there,
and you can easily

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.410 align:middle line:90%
end up there in a dream state.

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:18.030 align:middle line:84%
However, it's quite easy to set
your intention not to go there.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.280 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself
repetitively

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.160 align:middle line:84%
having nightmares and stuff,
you can say, you know what?

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to dream
on maybe the fifth

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.120 align:middle line:90%
or the sixth or the seventh.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Thank you, George.

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a wonderful idea--

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.380 align:middle line:84%
traveling through
different dimensions,

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.160 align:middle line:84%
but the higher you get,
the better off you are.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:42.020 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:47.000 align:middle line:90%
