00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.470 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief" with
a very special guest,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Konstantin Korotkov.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.440 align:middle line:10%
He is a professor of
computer science, biophysics,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:10%
and psychology in St.
Petersburg, Russia.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:84%
He has published more than 300
papers on physics and biology,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:84%
holding 15 patents on
biophysics inventions.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.270 align:middle line:84%
He is currently
the lead researcher

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:84%
of a study investigating some
fascinating humanoid mummies

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:90%
found in Nazca, Peru.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.880 align:middle line:84%
He's here with us now to
talk about his latest work,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:90%
"Mysterious Mummies of Nazca."

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Korotkov, this
is a beautiful book.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KONSTANTIN KOROTKOV:
Thank you, thank you.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me how you
got involved in this topic.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.235 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: You see,
it is interesting,

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:10%
because in principle,
archaeology is not my topic.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.170 align:middle line:84%
My topic is biophysics,
physics, biology, psychology,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:90%
as you've told.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.685 align:middle line:84%
But I work with Gaia
company for many years.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.165 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And I've
been participating

00:01:24.165 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:90%
in different movies.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And for many years,
we're developing together

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
with Gaia Company
our instrument,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Bio-Well instrument.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: This
special device that I've

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:84%
been inventing that allows us
to see energy fields of a human

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like auras.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: I don't
like this name "aura."

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.780 align:middle line:90%
This is something mysterious.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:84%
No, we talk about
biophysics, biological field.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Everybody of us, every one
of us has a biological field.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So working with Gaia
in developing this program,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:84%
we find out that
Gaia has been very

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.538 align:middle line:84%
instrumental in investigating
these mummies of Nazca.

00:02:04.538 --> 00:02:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, absolutely.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.090 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the topics.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.789 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a very
interesting story that

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm coming to
Gaia on a regular basis

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
to discuss different topics
of our joint projects.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And at one visit, it was in
April 2017, Jirka Rysavy, who

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:84%
is the leader of Gaia,
after our discussion,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:84%
he told me "do you know
about mummies found in Peru?"

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:90%
"Little, big?

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:90%
It's something nonsense.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:90%
It can't be so."

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.577 align:middle line:90%
"Do you want to see it?"

00:02:37.577 --> 00:02:39.160 align:middle line:84%
"No, of course I
would be interested."

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: "Would you
like to fly there?"

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:90%
"Why not?"

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:90%
"When?"

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:90%
It was on Wednesday.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And he told that we have a
crew of Gaia coming there

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:90%
on Saturday.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: But anyway,
I just was just in time

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:90%
to be there in Peru.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And together with the crew,
we came to one little city,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.280 align:middle line:90%
the name of Palpa.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Nazca area.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.127 align:middle line:90%
But a little, little settlement.

00:03:04.127 --> 00:03:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Small town.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.127 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Very small town.

00:03:06.127 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And there in the
morning, we came

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:84%
to the house of a local guy
who found those mummies.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many?

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: We don't know
how many that he has.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: We don't know this.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.502 align:middle line:84%
Because this guy, local
guy, let's name him Mario,

00:03:24.502 --> 00:03:26.085 align:middle line:84%
but it's not his
real name, of course.

00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:26.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: In South
America, archaeology

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
exists for maybe
150 years, not more.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.770 align:middle line:90%
A little bit plus minus.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So and of
course, it's limited money.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:90%
It's limited abilities.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And archaeology, it's a
very, very long process.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And in truth, there are
many places of this kind.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
That's why local people,
they used to go somewhere.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.560 align:middle line:84%
They look for some
ancient places,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.655 align:middle line:90%
look for some treasures.

00:03:54.655 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hunt, everything.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they sell
it on the market.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:90%
It's very typical.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: It is totally
forbidden of course, in Peru.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, right.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.687 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Totally
forbidden, but they do it.

00:04:04.687 --> 00:04:09.122 align:middle line:84%
And as Peru has tremendous
ocean line, you understand,

00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:10.330 align:middle line:90%
it's very easy to get it out.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Easy to
get it in and out.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.067 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So is
this Mario person,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.482 align:middle line:84%
who's not his real
name, uncovered

00:04:17.482 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:90%
some of these mummies?

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:90%
He found them?

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, he found them
in the mountains, in some cave.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And when he found, he's seen
that it's something unusual,

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.280 align:middle line:84%
he was understanding
that it is something

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.040 align:middle line:90%
that he can get money on.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
almost, Doctor, about what?

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:90%
This big?

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Some of them bigger.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, there
are two types of mummies now.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:84%
One mummy, her name is
Maria because she's female.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
She's of our size, 168
centimeters, just our size,

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much like our
self, except of three fingers

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.958 align:middle line:90%
and three toes.

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Natural three fingers.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.292 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, natural.

00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And now it's proven
that those are natural.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:90%
It's totally proven.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And then that we have another
mummies, little ones like this.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.648 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Babies?

00:05:07.648 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: No,
those are not babies.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:90%
Those are special creatures.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And we have no doubt
that they're real creatures,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:90%
because now we have found--

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I've seen myself
five of them, five

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:90%
mummies of these little ones.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are one head, several
limbs with three fingers.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And all of them
have three fingers.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:84%
All of them has very unusual
appearance, of course

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:90%
and very unusual construction.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.523 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to look at a
video from Unearthing Nazca.

00:05:39.523 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Wait till we see this.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: OK.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's see it.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.523 align:middle line:10%
>>MELISSA TITTL: We
get a lot of leads

00:05:44.523 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:10%
here at Gaia regarding new
discoveries or investigations,

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:10%
but one particularly
interesting lead

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:10%
came to us from a journalist
named Jaime Maussan.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:10%
>>JAIME MAUSSAN: My
name is Jaime Maussan.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:10%
I am an investigative
journalist,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:10%
and I've been working as a
journalist for the last 47

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:10%
years of my life.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:10%
>>MELISSA TITTL: He got
word of some mummies in Peru

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:10%
that didn't look human.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY WEIDNER: We
decided to go to Peru

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:10%
and examine and see if
these were fake or real

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:10%
or what were they.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:10%
Our crew jumped on an airplane
and flew from Colorado

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:10%
to Lima, Peru with cameras
and everything in tow.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:10%
Jaime also took a
camera crew with us.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.860 align:middle line:10%
We also took scientists.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: And we have a very
important mission here in Peru.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:10%
I came here together with
a group of scientists,

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.527 align:middle line:10%
professionals, journalists.

00:06:35.527 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:10%
>>MELISSA TITTL: Once
the scientists arrive,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:10%
the body is revealed and
they get to analyze it

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.498 align:middle line:10%
for the first time.

00:06:40.498 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY WEIDNER: When he brought
it out and pulled it out

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:10%
of the box, it was a
stunned silence at first.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: It was
prepared mummy.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.890 align:middle line:10%
The size of this humanoid
was 168 centimeters.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:84%
It's practically my size,
a little bit shorter.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.730 align:middle line:10%
So it means that
this was a person who

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:10%
was walking as we do, who was
able to move hence, as we have,

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:10%
with long legs.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So proportion of the body
was very similar to ours.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:10%
It is absolutely authentic
hand with three long fingers,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.890 align:middle line:10%
very long.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:10%
>>JOSE DE JESUS ZALCE
BENITEZ: The three fingers

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.640 align:middle line:10%
is a characteristic that makes
it unique and unforgettable.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:10%
And that is what exactly makes
us think that this does not

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:10%
belong to a human species.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.090 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: Then of course,
very important head.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:10%
That, of course, was
the most amazing.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle line:10%
It was not our rounded skull,
but it was a very protubed

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.880 align:middle line:10%
skull, very clear.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:10%
And on this count as well,
it was very, very natural,

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:10%
very interesting.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.240 align:middle line:10%
They had knees
and nose, no ears.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.735 align:middle line:10%
Only little holes.

00:07:54.735 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:10%
>>JAIME MAUSSAN: The mummies
are covered completely

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:10%
in this white dust.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:10%
But it's not just white dust.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:06.430 align:middle line:10%
It's something that is going
to really dry the skin,

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:10%
and the skin will be able to
survive for so many years.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.393 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It does look
extraterrestrial, doesn't it?

00:08:15.393 --> 00:08:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: It
looks very strange.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very strange, indeed.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Very
strange, absolutely.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why when we've seen
this for the first time,

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:90%
it was really shock.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this was
the female version

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.566 align:middle line:90%
that you were talking about?

00:08:25.566 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, it was
proven that it's female.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Both by
anatomy and by DNA study.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:90%
So it was--

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could there
be human defects that

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:90%
would create that kind of look?

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:37.989 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No, no.

00:08:37.989 --> 00:08:39.864 align:middle line:84%
Again, of course it was
the first assumption.

00:08:39.864 --> 00:08:40.664 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:40.664 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: There is
some genetic defects

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:90%
or modifications.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:90%
No, it's absolutely sure not.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we know this type of
defects, when people have two

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:90%
fingers just bound together.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.582 align:middle line:84%
But the construction of the
palm and feet is like ours.

00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
It's absolute sure,
because we have

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.080 align:middle line:90%
this specific construction.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.160 align:middle line:84%
For her, anatomy
of palm and feet

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:84%
is totally different,
totally different.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So it is absolutely clear
that her anatomy was specially

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:84%
designed by nature or for
by I don't know to have

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.650 align:middle line:90%
three fingers and three toes.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.647 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the fingers
are-- would be these three?

00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Three fingers.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No thumb?

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: No thumb, but
we have three phalanges.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.720 align:middle line:90%
She had four.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.840 align:middle line:84%
But it was of course question
of how it's possible to use it,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:90%
but all China use sticks.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: And it's very nice.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:90%
So why not?

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly, and it works.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.363 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, it
works, absolutely.

00:09:42.363 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's clear that
it's possible.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we know,
Professor, how old

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.525 align:middle line:90%
the entity might have been?

00:09:49.525 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, of course.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It was the first question,
because it was very strange,

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.200 align:middle line:84%
We discussed with other
scientists about this topic,

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:84%
but we was not
sure before we had

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:05.440 align:middle line:90%
this analysis of carbon dating.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Because this is accepted--

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.432 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: --Analysis of time.

00:10:09.432 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not very accurate.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:90%
We know this now.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:90%
But it allows us to evaluate.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gives you a range.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, whether it is
30 years, 50 years, 100 years,

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:90%
or a thousand years.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.340 align:middle line:10%
So it was proven by several
independent analyses

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:10%
that this mummy has
about 2,000 years.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 2,000 years.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.760 align:middle line:10%
So she belongs to a
time of about 200 AD,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.675 align:middle line:10%
and it was the time
of Nazca civilisation.

00:10:38.675 --> 00:10:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Very well
known as archaeologists.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and we know
from Erich von Daeniken's book,

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.260 align:middle line:84%
"The Chariots of the
Gods," that the Nazca

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Lines, in his opinion, and
probably rightfully so,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle line:90%
were made for those from above.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And so if this times to
that period, who's to

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.828 align:middle line:84%
say that she wasn't part of
that group that came down here?

00:11:05.828 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, you are right.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:07.920 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:90%
It was my conclusion as well.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that Nazca
geoglyphs, they're

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:84%
named as geoglyphs,
these different--

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and you know that
they are-- now it's

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
known that they are not
only in the Nazca plateau.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
They are in the
Palpa area as well.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just a
little area, very little.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.020 align:middle line:84%
It is all this
big area in Nazca,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:90%
away on different mountains.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.220 align:middle line:90%
And we've seen it.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:90%
We've been there.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered
only recently

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:84%
there are very
complicated geoglyphs.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of them look like
mandelas, Indian mandelas.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of them-- one geoglyphs
looks like a big whale.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.748 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, spiders.

00:11:51.748 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, spiders.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So from our opinion,
it was of course

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:90%
designed to see from the air.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But it is clear that it's
not for lending sight.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a
sign of something.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: I think
it's not a sign.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:90%
Maybe let's imagine this.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:90%
They had some flying saucers.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Maybe something.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:15.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they came here.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, and they
were flying on something.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they made
this training site,

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and the pilot was told, OK, now
you fly from Monkey to Spider.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.630 align:middle line:90%
And back.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.873 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you can
only make it out from above.

00:12:30.873 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, from above.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
know what you're

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:90%
looking at on the ground.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:34.465 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:35.757 align:middle line:90%
On the ground, you see nothing.

00:12:35.757 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been
to the Nazca area.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:90%
I've been to this plateau.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And from the ground,
you see only lines.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't understand
what does it mean.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:90%
So it's a training site.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there any idea
how the entity may have died?

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Was it killed?

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Did it die from some situation?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.122 align:middle line:90%
Any idea?

00:12:56.122 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
we have this idea,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:84%
because after very careful
study of tomograms.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:07.350 align:middle line:84%
You know that CT scans were done
for Maria, for other creatures

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:90%
later in Cuzco.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And lately, we received
very detailed CT scans.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.510 align:middle line:10%
And we have my good colleague,
Professor Dmitry Galetsky

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:10%
from our medical university,
who is top level anatomist.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So he made very detailed
analysis of this anatomy.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And his conclusions,
his latest conclusion,

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:84%
was that both Maria
and little creatures,

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:90%
they were killed by some animal.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were killed?

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: By some animal.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Because he found
the tracks of claws.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was a distance
between two tracks,

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:84%
like correlated with
the claw of puma.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Puma, a cat?

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:54.585 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, lion.

00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a lion or cat.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Is mountain lion.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because
you know, in Peru,

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:90%
it was a lot of mountain lions.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So it was a
horrible death for her.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And you know that she
was well preserved.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:84%
All internal organs was
preserved very well.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And we were able in CT scan
to see all internal organs,

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.130 align:middle line:90%
except of reproduction organs.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So the lower part of the
body was just missing.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Same as the
lower part of spine.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.652 align:middle line:84%
So it was clear impression
that someone just get it out.

00:14:26.652 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ripped it out.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.902 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, ripped it out.

00:14:28.902 --> 00:14:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we've seen some
tracks of claws and tracks

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:90%
of some of teeth as well.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, Professor,
he made analysis.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.530 align:middle line:84%
On the tracks of teeth, he told
that it looks like puma teeth,

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:90%
like cat teeth.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, because they're
about that big, the teeth.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.747 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:14:51.747 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:84%
But you see, cats and bear, they
have different type of teeth.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.053 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So just
by track of teeth,

00:14:58.053 --> 00:15:01.468 align:middle line:84%
you can tell whether it was
cat or bear of or a dog.

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whatever
happened there her,

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.927 align:middle line:84%
Doctor, she died
a horrible death.

00:15:04.927 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, I am afraid so.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tragic.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Plus, on her face, we
see one eye is swollen.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.840 align:middle line:90%
One part of the face is swollen.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So again, it was like a
blow, very strong blow.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And one eye is open,
another eye is closed.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She may have
been sitting down, eating

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
or something, and this
puma came and attacked her?

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.272 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, absolutely,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:15:29.272 --> 00:15:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So it was typical
in ancient times

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:90%
that puma attacked people.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Because for them,
it's very easy prey.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:90%
You understand this.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient
legends, we have a lot

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:90%
of legends for these people.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.950 align:middle line:84%
When they communicated with
puma, puma was killing people.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.530 align:middle line:90%
They were just praying to pumas.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And you know that in all ancient
sites, there are image of puma

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so it's
everywhere in the culture.

00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:57.333 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Everywhere.

00:15:57.333 --> 00:15:58.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes, in all their culture.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So it is absolutely
typical for them.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have we
ruled out the fact

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.190 align:middle line:84%
that she was
definitely not human?

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have that?

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No, no, no.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.008 align:middle line:90%
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:16:10.008 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a very complicated topic.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Of course, we made DNA analysis.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And it took
practically two years.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That long?

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: That
long, that long.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So final conclusion
was as follows.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Maria, she belongs
to human type.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Type?

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Type.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The key word.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:36.915 align:middle line:84%
But her DNA doesn't correlate
with any DNA of known to us

00:16:36.915 --> 00:16:37.715 align:middle line:90%
human species.

00:16:37.715 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah-hah.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So of course,
maybe it was some ancient DNA.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Maybe from-- because it not so
many analysis of ancient DNA.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.620 align:middle line:90%
Now it's coming more and more.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.217 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Now
it's very popular.

00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could she have been
a hybrid, a genetic human

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrial combined?

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see,
again, I don't like

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:90%
to talk about extraterrestrial.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.123 align:middle line:90%
Because as scientist, I can't--

00:17:05.123 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You want the facts.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, I want facts.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.930 align:middle line:90%
So I know the fact.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:90%
This is Maria.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:90%
She is humanlike.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:90%
Her DNA is human.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But she has about from 40% to
60% correlation with humans.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because clearly
she doesn't look human.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.243 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big head, oval head.

00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.582 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Slit nose, ears
that are gone, basically.

00:17:27.582 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: But you
see, very interesting

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:90%
topic, another topic.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:84%
You know that there are a
lot of elongated skulls.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Found in the world.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, absolutely.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.035 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And we
have Brian Foerster,

00:17:38.035 --> 00:17:39.810 align:middle line:90%
who is very deep in this study.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And we've been traveling
in Nazca together

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:90%
with Professor Galinsky.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:84%
We came to a museum where they
have a lot of elongated skulls,

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
so we were able to look
at them, to check them.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's clear that
some elongated skulls,

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:90%
they're deformed.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:84%
It was traditions
for many ancients.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.783 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they
would expand the skull.

00:17:59.783 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, for babies.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For babies.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.657 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: For babies, yes.

00:18:02.657 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But some of them
are real for sure.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Because they have holes in
the skull that we don't have.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's clear, if
this elongated skull,

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:84%
then the bigger
size of brain, then

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.718 align:middle line:84%
those holes allow them to have
extra blood flow in the brain.

00:18:19.718 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
look at more of the Gaia show

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.145 align:middle line:90%
from "Unearthing Nazca."

00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.570 align:middle line:10%
>>MELISSA TITTL: Hi
I'm Melissa Tittl, one

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.670 align:middle line:10%
of the producers at Gaia
who went down to Peru

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:39.530 align:middle line:10%
in 2017 to document the first
discovery of several mummies.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.680 align:middle line:10%
For the past year, our team has
been reporting on these bodies,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:10%
and today we have some
results regarding Maria

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:10%
and another body name Vavita.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:10%
Let's recap what we have
discovered thus far.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:84%
We took samples from
four areas in the body.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:84%
The fingers, the toes, the
lower region of the pelvis,

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:90%
and under the arm.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.740 align:middle line:10%
The CAT scans and
x-rays revealed

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:10%
that Maria seemed
to have what looked

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:10%
like a complete human
skeletal composition.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:10%
Carbon dating we
commissioned suggested

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:10%
that she was somewhere
around 1,700 years old.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:10%
We also tested the white
powder that covered her body,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.910 align:middle line:10%
and this test revealed it
was diatomaceous earth.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
In the same area, a
baby named Vavita.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:84%
The carbon dating suggested
this body was 670 years old,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:90%
but looks similar.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.340 align:middle line:10%
With all of this
information, we decided

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:10%
to get DNA tests to
get more clarity.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:10%
And after being denied by
various experts in universities

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.830 align:middle line:10%
in America, we sent the
samples to various labs

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:10%
in other countries, and the
experts at the Russian Academy

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:10%
of Sciences at St.
Petersburg University

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:10%
delivered the first results.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:10%
After many months of
waiting for DNA sequencing,

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:10%
a report was
generated by the team,

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:55.658 align:middle line:10%
and this is what it revealed
about Vavita and Maria.

00:19:55.658 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:10%
>>INTERPRETER: The
sequencing process

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:10%
itself is run on a device
called the genome sequencer.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:10%
In our case, we use
two sequencers, one

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:10%
for the primary analysis, MiSeq
sequencer and HiSeq sequencer

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.615 align:middle line:10%
for a comparative analysis
of the genomic DNA.

00:20:11.615 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
A great amount of data is
generated after sequencing.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:10%
This data is generated
in the machine.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:10%
After this data
has been generated,

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:10%
they are transferred
to a computer,

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.720 align:middle line:10%
and then our colleague,
Alexey, a bioinformatician,

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:10%
uses them to analyze the data.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And then we process the
deciphered sequence.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
We remove in the first
place various impurities.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we compare it
with an available sequence.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:84%
He found out that they were
actually ancient samples.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And we could yield the
ancient DNA, and we have it.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:84%
The fact that this
ancient DNA has

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:84%
a lot of variations that are
alternative to the standard

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:90%
genome is quite interesting.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it tells
us that we actually

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.490 align:middle line:90%
have unique and new data.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.868 align:middle line:84%
So we have not added
anything to it.

00:20:58.868 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Much like you've
said, it's fascinating.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.502 align:middle line:90%
It's totally fascinating.

00:21:02.502 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because my
assumption that Maria,

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.960 align:middle line:84%
she is just a new
type of humans.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So my suggestion to
name it is Homo nazca.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:17.120 align:middle line:84%
You know that we have
ourselves, Homo sapiens.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.970 align:middle line:90%
We have a Homo neandertalis.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.090 align:middle line:90%
And we have Homo denison.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Now it
is a new Homo that

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.220 align:middle line:84%
was found in different
parts of the world.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's absolutely clear that
about 1 million years ago, it

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:84%
was a moment where
there was diversity

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:90%
of different types of Homo.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is she
curled up like that?

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
it's not strange,

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:84%
because it was typical position
for mummies, dying people,

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.470 align:middle line:84%
dead people in the
Nazca civilization,

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.340 align:middle line:90%
absolutely typical position.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
We know many, many
mummies of this type.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So after death, people was
put into this position,

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:90%
and they were buried somewhere.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:90%
In some caves they were seated.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: So it was typical.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where will new
research take this project?

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.603 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:22:06.603 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see now our
situation is very complicated,

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:84%
because we've been addressing
Peruvian government.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:10%
We had hearings in Peruvian
Congress led by the congressman

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.220 align:middle line:10%
from Nazca area.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: It was teams
from different countries.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.700 align:middle line:84%
From United States, from Peru,
from France, from Mexico.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And all these teams
presented their own results.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We all independently came to
one of the same conclusions,

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:90%
that OK, this is real.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:39.272 align:middle line:90%
It's not fake.

00:22:39.272 --> 00:22:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not fake.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.143 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:22:41.143 --> 00:22:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: That's
very important,

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:84%
because it took us two years
to prove that it's not fake.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I think one of
the original thoughts of Gaia

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.063 align:middle line:84%
was, let's find out
if it's real or fake.

00:22:53.063 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
wanted to find out.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:23:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And you see, before
we got carbon dating for Maria,

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:90%
we wasn't sure at all.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Before that, we agreed
that we keep silence.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Only after this we start
doing something else.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because
now, again, all teams

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.230 align:middle line:84%
came to the conclusion
that this was fake.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:19.640 align:middle line:84%
It was done in a study
in different laboratories

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:90%
in different parts of the world.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:84%
We all came to one and
the same conclusions.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:84%
A little bit different
numbers but same conclusions.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So then we address the
Peruvian government.

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Look, you have
something very unusual.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.683 align:middle line:84%
You have something
very interesting.

00:23:33.683 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
understand this?

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Not at
all, not at all.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not at all.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.155 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think so.

00:23:38.155 --> 00:23:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Unfortunately,
we told them

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:90%
it belongs to Peruvian people.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: It can really
create tremendous effect

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.130 align:middle line:90%
on all the world.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.747 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where's
the mummies now?

00:23:48.747 --> 00:23:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Now they
are somewhere in Cuzco.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cuzco.

00:23:51.095 --> 00:23:52.553 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: In a
private Institute.

00:23:52.553 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately they're
kept somewhere on a shelf.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't get to it?

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Not.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But you see, if they would be
kept this way, after 30 years,

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:90%
they will disappear.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.588 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because
this type of mummies,

00:24:07.588 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:84%
they should be kept in
very special condition.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:10.848 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:10.848 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of tube or something.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.807 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:24:13.807 --> 00:24:15.660 align:middle line:84%
The best of course in
air-gone atmosphere.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And of course, it's
possible only in some museum

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:90%
or in some university.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So it was a lot of talks
with different universities.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:84%
now as I know, there are some
discussion with EKA University.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they will be taken there.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Then they would be
available to scientists.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Because it's interesting.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Not interesting an
unfortunate situation.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.775 align:middle line:84%
You see, I like
to publish papers.

00:24:40.775 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:90%
If I have something--

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
more than 300 already.

00:24:43.075 --> 00:24:44.742 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:24:44.742 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:90%
So I know how to do this.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So we would be happy to
publish papers on our research,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:90%
but we can't do this.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Because in any paper on ancient
study, you need to tell,

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, this mummy was
found there and there.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.348 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Now
this mummy is there

00:25:00.348 --> 00:25:03.176 align:middle line:84%
and samples was taken
there and there.

00:25:03.176 --> 00:25:06.192 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a press
conference in 2017 dealing

00:25:06.192 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:90%
with this incredible subject.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:25:10.250 --> 00:26:27.230 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he
was pretty dramatic.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And this individual from Peru
wants those mummies in Nazca.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he
going to get that?

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, that's
a very poor situation.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:41.310 align:middle line:90%
People want it.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.750 align:middle line:90%
People understand it.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:90%
But government, they are closed.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists, they
don't accept it.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Professional archaeologists.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:84%
That's a very pity
situation for all of us,

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:90%
because mummies are in Peru.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.950 align:middle line:90%
They belong to Peru.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: No one
wants to take them out,

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.980 align:middle line:84%
but they should be
placed somewhere.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And protected.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And
protected, of course.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.468 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And protected.

00:27:04.468 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Are some people still doubtful,
Professor, of what they are?

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You
see, this, my book,

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
the first published
reference about real study.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look
to the internet,

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.560 align:middle line:84%
you see many, many
different opinions.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, some
fake, some not.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.733 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Some fake, some not.

00:27:21.733 --> 00:27:24.150 align:middle line:90%
But it's not real data.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Only now we have this real data
about anatomy, about DNA study.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this book,
I try to present it

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:90%
in a very organized way.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this tell
you about our civilization

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.925 align:middle line:90%
on this planet a long time ago?

00:27:42.925 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:90%
What have we learned?

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see,
I'm very interested--

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I was very interested
in history all the time,

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and I know quite
well human history.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm 100% sure we have
about 250,000 years of human

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.000 align:middle line:90%
like we are.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Homo sapiens.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:84%
In the same body,
in the same spirit.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We haven't changed.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.010 align:middle line:90%
We haven't changed.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes I
feel 250,000 years old.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Oh yeah.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But we have only 10,000 years
of known to us civilizations.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Plus, and in even in
known to us civilizations,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of artifacts
that are unexplainable.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, many
discussions still talks

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.260 align:middle line:90%
about the Egyptian pyramids.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.655 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:28:29.655 --> 00:28:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: More
and more we find

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.370 align:middle line:90%
new topics in those pyramids.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, just recently we
had access to underground caves

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:39.350 align:middle line:90%
under pyramids.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing construction.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's clear that all
that we have in Egypt,

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.800 align:middle line:84%
it belongs to some
other civilization.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Previous
civilization.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So for me personally,
I have no doubt

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.510 align:middle line:90%
it was previous civilizations.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Same, for example, with Bosnia.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Bosnian pyramid.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.085 align:middle line:90%
I've been there several times.

00:29:05.085 --> 00:29:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, and
that's fascinating.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:07.918 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: It's fascinating.

00:29:07.918 --> 00:29:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you see it, it's no
doubt that it's human-made.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.080 align:middle line:90%
No doubt.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And was a lot of study done,
a lot of research done.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it needs
more and more research.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:90%
And underground tunnels.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And you see now we
have, for example,

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.790 align:middle line:84%
many tunnels found in
different parts of the world.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And most of those tunnels,
they were closed with earth.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So it was clear
some civilization

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.520 align:middle line:90%
created these tunnels.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Then later on it was
just packed with earth.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Will we get answers to
what these mummies are?

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Do you think?

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, I believe
that it's only the first step.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Because now our goal,
together with Gaia,

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:90%
was to present it to the world.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you've done that.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've done
that in a big way.

00:29:55.685 --> 00:29:56.852 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:29:56.852 --> 00:30:00.310 align:middle line:84%
We've let it known to show
people that this is serious,

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.400 align:middle line:84%
to attract attention
of interested people,

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.650 align:middle line:90%
of serious researchers.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm sure it will
be found more and more.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:12.100 align:middle line:84%
First question, why the
three-finger mummies

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.930 align:middle line:90%
wasn't found before?

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:90%
But let's imagine--

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.375 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:17.500 align:middle line:90%
After all these years, too.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.917 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
but let's imagine

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:22.720 align:middle line:84%
they were buried, just
burned out their bodies,

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.960 align:middle line:90%
like in India.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.540 align:middle line:90%
So we can find nothing.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine that
archaeologists

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.090 align:middle line:84%
was able to find
something of this kind,

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:34.270 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't pay attention,
because they never ever

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:38.150 align:middle line:84%
had the idea that three fingers
may belong to real human.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:41.170 align:middle line:84%
They were just like,
oh, it's just something.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that if we
look to some basements

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.850 align:middle line:84%
of big archaeological
institutions,

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:50.212 align:middle line:90%
it would be possible to find--

00:30:50.212 --> 00:30:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More of these.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: More
of these, yes, yes.

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All with three
fingers, probably.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.907 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:30:54.907 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how many toes?

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Three.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Three?

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Also three.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.210 align:middle line:90%
Also three.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:00.190 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it unusual for
a species on this planet--

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To be so different?

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: No, you see, we had
many reptilians of this kind.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why one of the
concepts was that it's just

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.420 align:middle line:90%
descendant of reptilians.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.770 align:middle line:84%
We had some birds that
has again this type.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:25.338 align:middle line:84%
We had some animals with three
fingers in South America.

00:31:25.338 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's true.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So it's
not so unusual.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's not, I would
say, so dramatic,

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:84%
because it's possible to
use these three fingers

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and three toes to walk
and to operate with hands.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you first saw
the mummies, when you first

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:41.660 align:middle line:90%
saw them, what did you think?

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, for
me it was a big shock.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:84%
It was clear that
I faced something

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:90%
very strange, very unusual.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it emotional?

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Very
emotional, very emotional.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And of course, from
one hand it was

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.930 align:middle line:84%
strong emotions,
from the other hand,

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:58.760 align:middle line:90%
it was always some disbelief.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.018 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because
as a scientist,

00:32:01.018 --> 00:32:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I was always unsure whether
it's real or maybe it's fake.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was just
made by someone.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So again, it took us all,
and me in particular,

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.370 align:middle line:84%
more than a year to prove
for ourselves that it's real.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.592 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
covering over the body?

00:32:18.592 --> 00:32:19.392 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:32:19.392 --> 00:32:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, this
is so-named diatomic earth.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which they use in
swimming pools as a filter.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's nothing unusual.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And the
first assumption

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:middle line:84%
was that it was something
specially prepared.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.690 align:middle line:84%
But when we've been
with Professor Galinsky,

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:38.500 align:middle line:84%
we were taken to the cave
by Mario just last autumn,

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.180 align:middle line:84%
we've seen that there are
a lot of this type of dust

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:90%
over there.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you mix it with
water, it becomes like a paste.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so they probably
put that all over the body.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.775 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, of course.

00:32:48.775 --> 00:32:53.110 align:middle line:84%
It is well to preserve this
body from deterioration.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.657 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Plus, we
should understand--

00:32:55.657 --> 00:32:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We embalm bodies now.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:58.780 align:middle line:90%
This is what they did then.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.447 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:33:00.447 --> 00:33:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Plus, very important,
in those areas of Nazca,

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:06.550 align:middle line:90%
there are no rains.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Last rain was maybe a couple
of thousand years ago.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And thus when
you go to the mountains,

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.250 align:middle line:84%
you see it has no
vegetation at all.

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:17.050 align:middle line:90%
No grass.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No trees, nothing.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All rock, I guess.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:20.387 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: All rocks.

00:33:20.387 --> 00:33:22.000 align:middle line:90%
All dead rocks.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Some poor cactuses,
but very poor as well.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So it is absolutely,
it's a very dry area.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why in this area
there are no humidity

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:90%
and no mold, no bacteria.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why it allows
to preserve it so.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Professor, tell us
about the second creature

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:45.250 align:middle line:84%
or entity, the
smaller one, that you

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.710 align:middle line:90%
said definitely looks strange.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:48.620 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.162 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: It's
not so very strange.

00:33:50.162 --> 00:33:51.950 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely not human-like.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there
DNA done on that, too?

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
yes, absolutely.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they
conclude on that one?

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see, when they
did the DNA, first of all,

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.400 align:middle line:84%
it was proven that
it is organic.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.517 align:middle line:84%
Second, it was proven
that it's ancient DNA.

00:34:06.517 --> 00:34:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Because now scientists
can tell whether it's

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:11.440 align:middle line:90%
ancient DNA or just modern.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they are
doing calculations

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:19.540 align:middle line:84%
in very powerful computers,
comparing this particular DNA

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.080 align:middle line:84%
with all possible
DNA of all living--

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Creatures.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.119 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Not only creatures
but bacteria or microbes.

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:27.952 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:34:27.952 --> 00:34:28.752 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:34:28.752 --> 00:34:29.552 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:34:29.552 --> 00:34:30.469 align:middle line:90%
They go back that far.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Animals, plants.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.917 align:middle line:84%
So what do what they can
get, because now they

00:34:33.917 --> 00:34:34.750 align:middle line:90%
have huge libraries.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.929 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Libraries of data.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what did
they conclude about this?

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No correlation.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Nothing.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They have
no idea what it is.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.139 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No idea.

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think this is?

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see,
there are two assumptions.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.150 align:middle line:84%
One assumption, it's maybe
some genetic experiment.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:50.922 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Even then?

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: What, then?

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.922 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2,000 years ago.

00:34:52.922 --> 00:34:53.722 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No.

00:34:53.722 --> 00:34:54.620 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not 2,000.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.390 align:middle line:90%
It's much older, much older.

00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is?

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: They are at
least 3,000 or maybe 6,000.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:05.542 align:middle line:84%
So it is clear that it came
from previous civilization.

00:35:05.542 --> 00:35:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of paint
us a picture, Professor,

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.170 align:middle line:90%
of what it looks like.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:09.837 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: You see,
I would describe it

00:35:09.837 --> 00:35:12.005 align:middle line:90%
as like a human robot.

00:35:12.005 --> 00:35:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Human robot?

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, robot.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.227 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:35:15.227 --> 00:35:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine this
high civilization.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
use slaves, but they

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.720 align:middle line:84%
have very high technology,
and they genetically

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.210 align:middle line:90%
create some human robots.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So those robots, they
have ability to move.

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're alive.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: They're alive.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: They can move.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
there are some talks

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.815 align:middle line:90%
that they look like reptilians.

00:35:37.815 --> 00:35:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe they've been
created from reptilians.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like
alligators or turtles?

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: No,
no, like dinosaurs.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because
in dinosaurs,

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.820 align:middle line:84%
we had this different type
of dinosaurs with three toes.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:50.620 align:middle line:90%
We had it.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: We had them
with just little hands.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.930 align:middle line:90%
They were--

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Small legs.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.248 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Small
legs, absolutely.

00:35:58.248 --> 00:36:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So just it's wild
assumptions as well.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not scientific, just crazy.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well--

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Crazy ideas.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that
could be as good

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.203 align:middle line:90%
an assumption as anything else.

00:36:06.203 --> 00:36:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So and then it's clear
that those creatures,

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.500 align:middle line:84%
little creatures, they were
operating like little slaves.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.352 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got more videos
from "Unearthing Nazca."

00:36:17.352 --> 00:36:18.152 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Mm-hm.

00:36:18.152 --> 00:36:21.480 align:middle line:90%


00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Based on my opinion
and perspective,

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:10%
which I feel is
informed by the data,

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.670 align:middle line:10%
I see strong indications that
suggest it's an authentic

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:33.390 align:middle line:10%
anomalous remains
of unknown origin.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.890 align:middle line:10%
>>MELISSA TITTL:
What does this mean

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.230 align:middle line:10%
for our ongoing investigation?

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.840 align:middle line:10%
Scientific data analysis
from this report

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.350 align:middle line:10%
shows us that the DNA
gathered from Maria and Vavita

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:46.440 align:middle line:10%
does not match any
modern human DNA.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.650 align:middle line:10%
As with most questions, it
reveals another question.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.920 align:middle line:10%
And we welcome independent
reporters to explore further,

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.210 align:middle line:10%
as we are.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:57.000 align:middle line:10%
Will further testing
reveal a subspecies,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.630 align:middle line:10%
DNA that is still unmatchable
to any species known?

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:10%
Or will it just bring
up more questions?

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.840 align:middle line:10%
Our scientists have some final
thoughts on the current report

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.700 align:middle line:10%
and the ongoing investigation.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.200 align:middle line:10%
>>KOROTKOV: As a
conclusion, I would

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:10%
say that it took us
practically a year

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.380 align:middle line:10%
to make this whole analysis.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's not finished yet, so
we're still in the process.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:24.650 align:middle line:84%
But it is absolutely
clear that we are faced

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.270 align:middle line:90%
with a very exciting situation.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Because all the
data that we have

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.270 align:middle line:84%
tells us that it's
not human-like.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.490 align:middle line:10%
It's not just simple
imitation, but it's

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:38.210 align:middle line:10%
another type of human species.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.570 align:middle line:10%
We don't know whether it
was some line of humans

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.410 align:middle line:10%
with elongated skulls
who were living

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:46.800 align:middle line:10%
on the earth for
maybe millenniums,

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.980 align:middle line:10%
but I'm sure that
it will open up

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:10%
a new page stage
of human history

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.830 align:middle line:10%
and new page of
civilization history.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:38:00.140 align:middle line:10%
>> This report says to me
that the remains of the Nazca

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:04.500 align:middle line:10%
mummies are, at this
time, of unknown origin.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.430 align:middle line:10%
It's a wow.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:08.840 align:middle line:10%
It's extremely surprising.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my final thoughts
are that this is an incredibly

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.570 align:middle line:90%
interesting find.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And it really needs
to be looked into.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's kind
of an exciting time

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that different groups can
apply different expertise.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.160 align:middle line:10%
We're no longer this little
individual groups anymore.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.840 align:middle line:90%
You have a global community.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.780 align:middle line:84%
We can bring everyone
together on the global scale

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.660 align:middle line:84%
to look and provide different
expertise in order to answer

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.190 align:middle line:90%
some of these questions.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Is it human?

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.420 align:middle line:10%
But beyond that, what does
it mean for humans as a race?

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.490 align:middle line:90%


00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What an amazing story.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And you really have
to applaud Gaia

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.208 align:middle line:84%
for continuing to
investigate this.

00:38:53.208 --> 00:38:54.583 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
yes, absolutely.

00:38:54.583 --> 00:38:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And you see, without Gaia, it
would have been impossible.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.658 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because
they stimulated this.

00:38:59.658 --> 00:39:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They paid for the DNA.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And all that.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.235 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, yes, and all
that, and all expeditions that

00:39:04.235 --> 00:39:06.300 align:middle line:90%
was done several times to Peru.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, only due to
Gaia, to their interest

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.300 align:middle line:84%
to this, to their enthusiasm
for the whole team.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.305 align:middle line:84%
We need to thank them for
doing this for humanity.

00:39:15.305 --> 00:39:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we were
looking at the individual who

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:20.640 align:middle line:84%
was talking at the conference
where Jaime Maussan was,

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.480 align:middle line:84%
he seemed very passionate,
being somebody from Nazca,

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.290 align:middle line:84%
that these remain there,
and that apparently they're

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:29.550 align:middle line:90%
very interested in this.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.002 align:middle line:84%
30 million people, he said,
watched this on television.

00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Absolutely.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And to me, would they
place this in some museum,

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.300 align:middle line:84%
they would have
millions of visitors

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.570 align:middle line:84%
just coming there to
see it, to look at it.

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So to
me, it would be

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:51.450 align:middle line:84%
very profitable for tourism for
all Peruvian people to have it.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.153 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
able to touch it?

00:39:53.153 --> 00:39:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yeah, of course.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Many times.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could?

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Many times.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:56.880 align:middle line:10%
Because of course--

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What goes
through your mind

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.050 align:middle line:10%
when you're touching something
like that, that's that old?

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Of
course, we had masks.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:03.810 align:middle line:90%
We had gloves.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so you
didn't contaminate.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:06.170 align:middle line:90%
No contamination.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.712 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: No, no,
no, no, of course

00:40:07.712 --> 00:40:10.260 align:middle line:84%
we didn't contaminate
it, as we could.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:84%
But of course it was
amazing, because I

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:17.930 align:middle line:84%
was able to keep in my hands
both Maria and little mummies

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:18.970 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you touch it,
you feel the structure.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.910 align:middle line:90%
You feel their bones.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.140 align:middle line:90%
You see their skin construction.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.402 align:middle line:84%
So it's very, very important
for us to understand.

00:40:28.402 --> 00:40:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody came
up to you, Professor,

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.770 align:middle line:90%
and said "this is a hoax.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a hoax,"
what do you tell them?

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: It's up to you.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:41.530 align:middle line:84%
You see, our goal-- to
present information.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Our goal-- to show
this to people.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:47.010 align:middle line:84%
If you are interested,
if you're open-minded,

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:49.320 align:middle line:90%
then you can accept it.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:84%
If you are closed like this,
if you think that it can't be

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:53.250 align:middle line:90%
because it's--

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tunnel
vision, as we say.

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.440 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.490 align:middle line:84%
It's all depends
on the individual.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.240 align:middle line:84%
We have people who want
to see something new, who

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.550 align:middle line:90%
want to develop.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
who are very narrow

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and who are afraid to
get out of their tunnel.

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may have
come across something

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.920 align:middle line:84%
of some incredible
magnitude here,

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.330 align:middle line:84%
of another civilization
that existed on this planet.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Is it conceivable that they
came from a different region,

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.420 align:middle line:84%
maybe in Europe and
ended up in Peru?

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:30.270 align:middle line:84%
You know that the latest
study of Brian Foerster, he

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:32.440 align:middle line:90%
did DNA of elongated skulls.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: In Paracus.

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And he demonstrated they
have very high correlation

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:42.520 align:middle line:84%
with DNA of people in
Black Sea in Europe.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's very likely
that there was

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:50.910 align:middle line:84%
very strong connections between
Europe and South America.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Plus, you know in Mexico,
there are huge heads.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Stone
heads of Negro people.

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: And never
ever before Spaniards

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.895 align:middle line:84%
it was known to us
Negro people there.

00:42:02.895 --> 00:42:03.695 align:middle line:90%
But they are huge.

00:42:03.695 --> 00:42:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they were there.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: They are there.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were there.

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.595 align:middle line:84%
So it is absolutely
clear there are

00:42:08.595 --> 00:42:12.450 align:middle line:84%
a lot of artifacts
known to us, published,

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:15.270 align:middle line:84%
that scientists, professional
archaeologists don't

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:16.470 align:middle line:90%
pay any attention.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:17.740 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely clear.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think of
their technology at that time?

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it may have been
high technology or primitive?

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: I think
it was different.

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it was not technological
civilization as we have.

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:33.930 align:middle line:90%
Look around.

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:35.310 align:middle line:90%
We have many instruments.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:37.342 align:middle line:84%
We have many different
types of equipment.

00:42:37.342 --> 00:42:38.175 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:42:38.175 --> 00:42:39.060 align:middle line:90%
Cameras, this that.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.352 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:42:40.352 --> 00:42:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Telephones and so on.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:42.960 align:middle line:90%
It was different.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine it was
a civilization that

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.270 align:middle line:90%
was in correlation with nature.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.780 align:middle line:84%
They've been using only
biodegradable materials.

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: That we can
do, but we don't do this.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:57.160 align:middle line:84%
They had been using
nature with care.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.860 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have war, because
it was some closed society.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.270 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't need it.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So they had absolutely
different type

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:08.160 align:middle line:90%
of development of civilization.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.951 align:middle line:84%
They were able maybe to create
the huge pyramids that we know,

00:43:11.951 --> 00:43:13.590 align:middle line:90%
huge buildings.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:18.193 align:middle line:84%
But maybe they were able
to use anti-gravity.

00:43:18.193 --> 00:43:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Now we have a lot of--

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV:
--Research about this.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They possessed
something, though.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.815 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:43:22.815 --> 00:43:23.982 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They had something.

00:43:23.982 --> 00:43:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: So it's
very likely, again--

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:29.100 align:middle line:84%
there's not just
any proof of this--

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.730 align:middle line:84%
that it was high developed
civilization, but different.

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you said
that it's possible

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that the female mummy died
at the hands of a puma.

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about that
other strange-looking creature

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.170 align:middle line:90%
that you folks discovered.

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Same conclusion.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.117 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe
at the same time.

00:43:50.117 --> 00:43:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: No, it was different
times, different times.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: But it's clear
that they were killed.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
many, many wounds.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not sacrificed?

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No, no.

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No sacrifice.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:04.998 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No sacrifice.

00:44:04.998 --> 00:44:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We talked
about many of the things

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:09.490 align:middle line:90%
that I'm sure is in the book.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Anything surprise you?

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Anything shock you?

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:15.538 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was that?

00:44:15.538 --> 00:44:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Because you see,
I'm still a classical scientist

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.710 align:middle line:90%
and biologist.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So for me to see little
creatures of absolutely

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:29.200 align:middle line:84%
different construction,
anatomy construction,

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.380 align:middle line:84%
different from all living
species on the earth--

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: --Not only from
humans but from animals

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:35.200 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shocking.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: For me,
it was shocking.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I understand what means
anatomy, how body is created.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I know a little bit about
anatomy of different species,

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:46.403 align:middle line:90%
of animals, snakes.

00:44:46.403 --> 00:44:47.320 align:middle line:90%
But they're different.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Totally different.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
ever get to a point

00:44:49.378 --> 00:44:52.360 align:middle line:84%
where we do autopsies
on these creatures,

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.270 align:middle line:84%
that we can cut into them and
look at their organs and things

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.080 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: This should be
done, but only under authority

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:01.370 align:middle line:90%
of official organizations.

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: That's why
we never touch them

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't even
take samples from them.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you have to
be careful you don't destroy.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.093 align:middle line:90%
Or can you do x-rays?

00:45:11.093 --> 00:45:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: It's done.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:13.993 align:middle line:90%
No X-ray, CT scan is done.

00:45:13.993 --> 00:45:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They've done scans.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.452 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: They've done scans.

00:45:16.452 --> 00:45:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But on high resolution
scan, Professor Galinsky,

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:26.260 align:middle line:84%
he demonstrated that one little
creature, she has eggs inside.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eggs?

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:27.345 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:45:27.345 --> 00:45:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes, absolutely.

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Real eggs.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't
that be something,

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.720 align:middle line:84%
if you could take those eggs
and somehow incubate them

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.520 align:middle line:90%
and they hatch?

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: No, no.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.940 align:middle line:90%
That's impossible.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.040 align:middle line:90%
That's impossible.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Because they are too--

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about cloning?

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:46.356 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Cloning,
that maybe, maybe.

00:45:46.356 --> 00:45:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Yes, of course we can
think about all this.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:52.181 align:middle line:90%
Maybe in the future--

00:45:52.181 --> 00:45:53.806 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My mind is
going wild thinking

00:45:53.806 --> 00:45:54.010 align:middle line:90%
of all these possibilities.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: Yes,
yes, yes, absolutely.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But first, of
course, it would be

00:45:57.370 --> 00:46:01.660 align:middle line:84%
very important to look at
these eggs, these eggs,

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and to the DNA or
the eggs, of course.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Because now all the DNA was
done from one little creature.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: From the neck.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:13.120 align:middle line:84%
But this sample was
very contaminated,

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.610 align:middle line:84%
because this neck
was exposed to air.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And what's in air?

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Around us, we have a
lot of contamination.

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: We have--

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.112 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It breaks things down.

00:46:23.112 --> 00:46:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: We breathe, we
contaminate with our breath.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.600 align:middle line:84%
We contaminate with
bacteria, with viruses.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it was a
lot of research steps

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.990 align:middle line:84%
to clean this DNA
from contamination.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you
learned from this experience?

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KOROTKOV: For me,
it was two lessons.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:47.980 align:middle line:10%
One lesson was, for me, it was
clear confirmation that it was

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.250 align:middle line:10%
some previous civilizations.

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.250 align:middle line:10%
And for me, it's very important.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:56.140 align:middle line:10%
Second lesson, it was, again,
very unpleasant surprise for me

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:59.583 align:middle line:10%
that professional science,
government doesn't

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:00.750 align:middle line:10%
want to pay attention to it.

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, thank
you for your work.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
being on the program.

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KOROTKOV: Thank you.

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.068 align:middle line:90%
It's a great pleasure for me.

00:47:06.068 --> 00:47:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing story.

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:10.480 align:middle line:10%
Mysterious "Mummies of Nazca."

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.190 align:middle line:10%
You saw the pictures.

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:13.630 align:middle line:10%
There's something there.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
