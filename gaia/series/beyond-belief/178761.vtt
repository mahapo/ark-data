00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:10%
And every once in a
while on "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:10%
we dive deep into the
psychology of the human mind.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And with us today
is Jonathan Zap.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Jonathan is a
author, researcher,

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.735 align:middle line:84%
paranormal investigator, and an
expert on Jungian philosophy.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Jonathan, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JONATHAN ZAP:
Thank you very much.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You remind
me of an actor

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:90%
who played in "Roger Rabbit."

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:90%
He's not with us anymore.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank God you are.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:90%
But you look identical to him.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Wow.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can't
remember the guy's name.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.939 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: I haven't seen
"Roger Rabbit" in so long,

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:59.401 align:middle line:84%
but I'll definitely
check that out.

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anyways, how are you?

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:90%
And welcome to the program.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: I'm well.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.926 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to be here.

00:01:03.926 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.030 align:middle line:90%
in studying Jungian philosophy?

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:90%
And what is that, by the way?

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: OK.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's kind of
an interesting story.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I had had my own
paranormal experiences

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:10%
since I was a small child.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:10%
But then in my last
year of college

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:10%
when I was just 20 years
old, I was given a chance

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.240 align:middle line:10%
to study some of these
things that had haunted me

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:10%
and to try and figure
out what was going on.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was my mom who was a
psychologist for 44 years who

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:84%
said, well, you should
look into this guy, Carl

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.545 align:middle line:84%
Jung, and his theory of
the collective unconscious

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:38.540 align:middle line:90%
and archetypes.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So I go up to the
college library.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:84%
There are these impressive
collected works, the Princeton

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Bollingen edition.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also kind of a bit
skeptical, because I'm like,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
this guy reached manhood
in the 19th century.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
He's the son of a
Protestant minister.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:84%
What's he going to have to say
about this weird Jewish kid

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.140 align:middle line:90%
and my sci-fi obsessions?

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- but I'm
like, I'll give it a try.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:90%
I pull up the index volume.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And right away, I
see-- oh, he wrote

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:84%
a book called "Flying Saucers
and the Modern Myth of Things

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.694 align:middle line:90%
Seen in the Sky."

00:02:05.694 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, that was a direct hit.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the stories that
I was obsessed with,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
especially a movie called
"Village of the Damned--"

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: --which is a
1960 black and white--

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It'll scare the
living daylights out of you.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Exactly.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, when I saw that it was--

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
because I'd seen many
great sci-fi movies.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But that one was like
a religious experience.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I knew it had some kind
of incredible, uncanny

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.870 align:middle line:90%
significance.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the
few that had that, but none

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:90%
more than that.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And that involved
flying saucers.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.112 align:middle line:84%
So I pull out that book
from the collective works.

00:02:37.112 --> 00:02:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And I see like,
wow, he was working

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
on this right at
the end of his life.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I start flipping
through the book.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And I see he couldn't
let go of the subject.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Because after the book,
there's like an afterword.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Then after the afterword,
there's an epilogue.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And then after the
epilogue, there's a third

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:90%
after thing, a supplement.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And I start thumbing
through the supplement.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And now, my jaw drops open,
because the supplement is

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Jung analyzing a science
fiction novel by British author

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:84%
John Wyndham called
the "Midwich Cuckoos."

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I already knew that
was the novel that the movie

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.110 align:middle line:90%
"Village of the Damned--"

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Based on.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: --was based on.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: So in my first
encounter with Jung,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:84%
he might as well have been a
holographic wizard stepping out

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:90%
of the bookcase and saying--

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
bearing a torch and saying,
I was interested in that one,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:90%
too, and here's what I thought.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:84%
His exact endpoint was
my exact start point.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I was then able to
use all the tools of Jungian

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
psychology to understand
the idea that there's

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:90%
this collective unconscious.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a collective
field of consciousness

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and how that works with our
present state of evolution.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jung worked a
lot with Sigmund Freud.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.602 align:middle line:84%
They were very
close at one point,

00:03:45.602 --> 00:03:46.685 align:middle line:90%
and then they broke apart.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Exactly.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.124 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were
many things that

00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:90%
caused them to break apart.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people think that
Jung was a bright student.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:90%
This wasn't true at all.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Jung had a much
more prestigious,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:90%
scientific pedigree.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
He was a professor at a
very serious university

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or had a natural--

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.146 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Respectability.

00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:90%
And also, Freud as a Jew--

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.210 align:middle line:84%
they were calling this
Jewish psychology.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And Jung was a
Protestant, and a Swiss,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and a very tall,
6 foot 5 or 6 guy.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.149 align:middle line:84%
So he gave a lot of credibility
to Freudian psychology.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
But where they
started to break apart

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
was that Freud was only
willing to go one layer deep

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.960 align:middle line:90%
into the personal unconscious.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was obsessed
with the sexual theory.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was afraid,
really, of other contents

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.200 align:middle line:84%
of the unconscious that began
to come up in people's dreams

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and even in some
of Jung's dreams.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And Jung eventually
couldn't take the repression

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:84%
of this other content, or even
some paranormal experiences

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
that happened with
both of them together.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And other things where
sort of these other aspects

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
of the unconscious and
paranormal phenomena

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:84%
were kind of exploding
into their relationship.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.974 align:middle line:84%
And Jung was ready to go
there, and Freud wasn't.

00:05:03.974 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
However, it should
be acknowledged

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:84%
that Freud was a great pioneer
and did many great things

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.842 align:middle line:84%
to break open exploration
of the unconscious.

00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jonathan,
there's a phrase

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:90%
called Singularity Archetype.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: OK.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.764 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is a term
that I invented.

00:05:20.764 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is what--

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is yours?

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Yes.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that in
1978 when I was 20 and when--

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:84%
after I discovered
Jung, then I discovered

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:84%
that there was an
archetype that previously--

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
unrecognized that I have
since called the Singularity

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:90%
Archetype.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And it relates to two
parallel event horizons.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
One is eschaton, which
could be loosely defined

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
as a kind of endpoint
of the species,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:84%
the point that people will
project apocalypse onto,

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:84%
but also, rapture, quantum
evolutionary shift.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:84%
It will be seen by the ego
as an apocalyptic event.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:84%
But it will be seen by what
Jung called the self, kind

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
of a totality of all
the psychic structures

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:90%
as a transcendent event.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And so this was a key
discovery I made when I was 20.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And the other event
horizon that it relates to

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
is the personal event
horizon of death.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like with a
hologram or a fractal,

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:84%
the small part
recapitulates the whole.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So the lifecycle of the
individual human being

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:84%
is also kind of like a
hologram, or a fractal pattern

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:90%
of the lifecycle of the species.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at some
of these science fiction

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:10%
and futuristic
projections of what

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.560 align:middle line:10%
may happen when we cross the
event horizon as a species,

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.670 align:middle line:10%
like we see in the movie
and the book "2001,"

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:10%
those things become
phenomenological actualities

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:10%
and near-death experience.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Things like a
telepathic network,

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:84%
a breakdown of the boundary
between self and other,

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
a transcendence of linear time,
transcending the physical body.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:84%
These things are all projected
in the modern mythology, which

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:84%
takes the form of
especially science fiction.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they also
actually happen

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
when people have near-death
experiences and related

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.060 align:middle line:84%
consciousness
transforming experiences.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people experience this
in dreams with hallucinogens,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.820 align:middle line:84%
with out-of-body experience, and
sometimes just spontaneously.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But the most powerful are
with near-death experience.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How consumed
are we, Jonathan,

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.650 align:middle line:84%
with death and discussing
death in our lifetime?

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, it's an
interesting thing.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Because many people will do
anything not to discuss it,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.360 align:middle line:90%
or to think about it.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.619 align:middle line:90%
But we live in a time--

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to trace
with you a little bit

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:84%
of the modern history of this,
where there is what our friend

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Whitley Strieber calls the
afterlife revolution going on.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.620 align:middle line:90%
And it really begins in 1848.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, obviously we've had--

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:84%
every human culture has had
people that have been mediums,

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:84%
or have communicated with people
on the other side or purported

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.390 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
In aboriginal
cultures, that would

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.590 align:middle line:84%
be a shaman whose
job might be largely

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:90%
to commune with the ancestors.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.755 align:middle line:90%
But in 1848, there was--

00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:28.010 align:middle line:84%
two evolutionary changes
happened more or less

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
One was the birth of the
Spiritualist movement.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:84%
This was really the beginning
of the afterlife revolution.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And it began in a
particular time and place--

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:84%
1848 in upstate New York
with the Fox sisters.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
They were the first ones
to do the modern kind of--

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
or the classic kind of
seance with the table.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What drove
them to do that?

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, I mean, that
is a history in itself.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:90%
And there's controversy.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Because one sister said
that some of what they did

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:90%
was fraudulent.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, a lot
of it was always--

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:84%
there has always been a history
of trickery mixed up with this

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:90%
as well as real phenomena.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Another sister talked about
there was a real phenomenon.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And what drove them,
I think, is what

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:84%
drives so many people to
look into this field who

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
want to know
answers, or have lost

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:84%
loved ones with whom
they want to commune.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And we'll actually
see this converge

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.530 align:middle line:84%
with the other change that
was happening at the same time

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
as the spiritualism
was being born.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It'll converge in the
Lincoln presidency,

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:90%
which I'll get to in a minute.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So at the same time that
spiritualism was being born,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:84%
we saw a huge
evolutionary event happen

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.090 align:middle line:84%
that is exploding right
around us right now.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is the birth of
electronic communication.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So what was going
on at the same time

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.800 align:middle line:84%
was the birth of electronic
telegraphy, the telegraph.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And to give you an idea
how close this was in time,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
in 1843 it came
before the Congress

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.930 align:middle line:84%
to fund an experiment
in telegraphy.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:90%
And it was very controversial.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of congressmen thought
it was magic, or it was a hoax.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they had
a vote and it was--

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:90%
they funded $30,000.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.334 align:middle line:84%
And it was 89 for, 80 against,
but with 70 congressmen

00:10:32.334 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
abstaining, because they
didn't even want their name

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:90%
associated with it.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.350 align:middle line:84%
There were clergymen at the
time who called it black magic.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was it?

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: And this
was the telegraph.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, that there's
a telegraph itself?

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Was black magic.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:84%
But by the time Lincoln
became president

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:84%
not too long after, and by the
time that the Fox sisters got

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.500 align:middle line:84%
going in 1848, almost
every major country

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:90%
had a telegraph system.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So they're happening almost
exactly the same time.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln, "The New
York Times" called

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:84%
our first wired president,
saw the potential

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.210 align:middle line:84%
of electronic
communication, telegraphy.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And so he was a
tremendous innovator

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:90%
with electronic communication.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the first situation
was really the telegraph office.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It was part of the
War building that

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:90%
was next to the White House.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And Lincoln would spend a
lot of his time in there.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, during
battles and so forth,

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:31.870 align:middle line:84%
he would actually sleep
in the telegraph office.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Waiting for messages?

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Waiting for
messages, reading ones that

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:90%
were not even addressed to him.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.872 align:middle line:84%
And in his telegrams, he
really made great use of it.

00:11:40.872 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Because most people
could only send

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.970 align:middle line:84%
these short, little messages,
because you paid by the letter.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:90%
But of course, he didn't have--

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.496 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whatever
he needed to do.

00:11:47.496 --> 00:11:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Yeah, so he would send
telegrams to Ulysses S. Grant,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.940 align:middle line:84%
for example, that were poetic
that really like emotionally

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.945 align:middle line:84%
tuned into what Grant was going
through and empathizing with

00:11:56.945 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:90%
these--

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Gettysburg
Address and things

00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:59.751 align:middle line:90%
like that all over again.

00:11:59.751 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Yeah.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But now, not only was he
our first wired president,

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:84%
he was our
spiritualist president.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Because in 1861,
he was traumatized

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:84%
by the death of probably
his famous favorite son

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.860 align:middle line:90%
right when he was in office.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And he was devastated and
his wife Mary Todd Lincoln

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:90%
was devastated.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, she was crushed.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: And so she
brought in spiritualists.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the evidence about how
much Lincoln participated

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.446 align:middle line:84%
is not solid, but of
course, he would not

00:12:33.446 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:90%
have wanted it to be solid.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:84%
But she publicly embraced
the spiritualists

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and definitely held
seances and so forth.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So here you see the birth
of both spiritualism

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and of electronic communications
both happening together.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And didn't he have a
dream, Jonathan, of there was

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:90%
a casket in the White House?

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he went up to
a soldier and it was him?

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Exactly.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.894 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he had an
incredible-- and this

00:12:58.894 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:90%
is very well documented.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:90%
This is solid.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:84%
He had an incredible,
prophetic dream about himself

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:90%
and being able to know.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've had experiences
like that about a death

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:90%
before it happens in this way.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So it specifically tells us
that death is not just quite

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.470 align:middle line:84%
what the materialists
would have us believe.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And so with the
Lincoln presidency,

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:84%
we find these two
themes converging.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And then it really continues
up until the present era.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.010 align:middle line:10%
And where there was a
great watershed moment

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.910 align:middle line:10%
was in 1975, when
Raymond Moody published

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:10%
his book "Life After Life."

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:10%
And now, this brings the
field of near-death experience

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.660 align:middle line:10%
into being.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
The terms life review and so
forth all are coined in 1975.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And then also what's
happening in addition

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
to the explosion
that's continuing

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:90%
of electronic communication--

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people have pointed
out that a kid in Africa

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.960 align:middle line:84%
today with a
smartphone-- and there

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.709 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of kids in
Africa who have them.

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not a luxury item anymore.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.120 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a
basic necessity--

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.630 align:middle line:84%
has access to more information
than President Clinton

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:84%
did in his first
term as president.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: And then another
technological trend

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.590 align:middle line:84%
that's going on is the explosion
of resuscitation technology

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that's happened since Raymond
Moody's book came out.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So now-- I mean, even just in
the last three or four years--

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now they say that if
the Titanic disaster happened

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
today, they could send a
boat in a few hours later--

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Most of those people.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: --to restart them.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And these people--
some people say

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.790 align:middle line:84%
it's a misnomer to call it
near death, because these

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
are people that meet every
clinical definition of death.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So never before in
human history have we

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.410 align:middle line:84%
had so many people who've
had such profound experiences

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:90%
of being dead and coming back.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:59.227 align:middle line:84%
But we've also never had so much
formal research in the field.

00:14:59.227 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is truly remarkable.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Some of it
published like Dr. Pim van

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.467 align:middle line:90%
Lommel, the Dutch cardiologist.

00:15:04.467 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, his work is
published in the journal

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:84%
"Lancet," a prestigious
medical journal.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.226 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
right, though, Jonathan.

00:15:10.226 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Technology today is
really changing things.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Technology is transforming
us at an accelerating pace.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:10%
It was Walter Isaacson
that expressed in his book

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:10%
"The Innovators" that he was
far less interested in making

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.590 align:middle line:10%
machines more human and far
more interested in the symbiosis

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:10%
between humans and machines.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:10%
This is the symbiosis that takes
place between our tools and us.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:10%
We are the tool-forging
species that

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:10%
will continue to innovate
and extend beyond ourselves

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:10%
and exceed our grasp.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:10%
This is exporting
our cognition the way

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.149 align:middle line:10%
that we export our cognition
into our mobile phones.

00:15:47.149 --> 00:15:49.440 align:middle line:10%
The supercomputer that we
have in our pockets that will

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.050 align:middle line:10%
now embody our
new state of mind.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:10%
This new state of mind is
also a new connected sphere

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.780 align:middle line:10%
within this universe, changing
the neural pathways and neural

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.866 align:middle line:10%
configurations in our brain at
the synaptic and axonal level.

00:16:00.866 --> 00:16:02.490 align:middle line:10%
Through dendrites
that are now starting

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.314 align:middle line:10%
to form the new tree
trunks in our brains

00:16:04.314 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:10%
and the self-similar
patterns that

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:10%
are forging these new
technologies that we

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:10%
have in our lives.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:10%


00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.076 align:middle line:10%
It's augmented
intelligence that's

00:16:13.076 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:10%
going to be the wave
of the future, not

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.210 align:middle line:10%
artificial intelligence.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:10%
Artificial intelligence
combined with our own humanity

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:10%
is going to be the new aperture,
the new substrate in which we

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:10%
can connect with one another.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:10%
This is going to enhance
who we are as individuals,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:10%
and we will transcend.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:10%
We will become transhuman
as Jason Silva says.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.420 align:middle line:10%
And it was Ray
Kurzweil that said

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:10%
with the embodiment of our
imagination and the way

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:10%
that we can model our minds
within our own imagination,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:10%
that combined with the
creativity that we have

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:10%
and also our modest
opposable thumbs are we

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:10%
the tool-forging species.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:10%
With that, we will continue
to innovate our lives

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.670 align:middle line:10%
and create new tools,
until the entire universe

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:10%
is at our fingertips.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you agree
with that, Jonathan,

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
that the entire universe
could be at our fingertips?

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, I think in
some ways it already is.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our reach is just
expanding exponentially.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we see-- and it
shouldn't be surprising

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
that organic evolution and
technological evolution

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.930 align:middle line:90%
parallel and synergize.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:90%
They're symbiotic.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.400 align:middle line:90%
One enhances the other.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And so for example, we
saw somebody looking

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.530 align:middle line:90%
into virtual reality goggles.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I believe based
on the technologists

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that I've spoken to that we
could right now, with just

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
off-the-shelf hardware,
create out-of-body experiences

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:90%
on demand for a lot of people.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.080 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Give them an opportunity
to feel it and see it.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Because they
can displace you

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.099 align:middle line:84%
from your proprioceptive
sense of where your body is.

00:17:41.099 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think in a lot of
people that would trigger

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.850 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And so now, if we have enough
of the population aware as I

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
am-- and many others have
had spontaneous out-of-body

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:56.190 align:middle line:84%
experiences-- that your
consciousness is not

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.320 align:middle line:90%
reducible to your meat body.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:84%
It is not completely
in your body.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And if enough people
realize that--

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:84%
because an out-of-body
experience--

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.200 align:middle line:84%
if you look at what Robert
Monroe and other great

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body explorers
have done, I mean,

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:84%
this can be as profound or
more profound than a near-death

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.800 align:middle line:90%
experience--

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For sure.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: --in creating
a contact with what's

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.029 align:middle line:84%
happening on the other side
of that great event horizon.

00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at this
from a point of view

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
of biological evolution
where evolution advances,

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:84%
there's always an
advance in communication,

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:84%
the flow of information,
and awareness.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
evolutionary biologists

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
will say that marsupials
like kangaroos,

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle line:84%
for example, are limited in
their evolutionary potential,

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:84%
because of their
brain structure.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
They lack the corpus callosum,
that dense bundle of nerves

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.840 align:middle line:90%
that we have and that most--

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
that mammals have that
allows communication

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.522 align:middle line:84%
between the left and
right hemispheres.

00:18:56.522 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of your brain?

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Right Similarly, 544
million years ago, we only

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.210 align:middle line:90%
had three phyla of animal life.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But then by 538
million years ago,

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:84%
just six million
years later, which

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:84%
wasn't much considering the
scale of time at that point,

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
we had 38 phyla of animal life,
the same number we have today.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened during
those six million years--

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and this is a theory called
the Light Switch Theory put out

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:84%
by Andrew Parker
who is an Oxford

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.820 align:middle line:90%
zoologist and some others--

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.050 align:middle line:90%
is that's when we evolved eyes.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Because once the
animals had eyes,

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.995 align:middle line:84%
the flow of information and
an awareness exponentiated.

00:19:37.995 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could have predators,
and prey, and so forth.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So everywhere we see this
improved flow of information.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And more recently, when
language is invented,

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:84%
we become the dominant animal,
because of our superior ability

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.360 align:middle line:90%
to process language.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Then when we developed
written alphabets,

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:90%
that was a big milestone.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But it may also have triggered
many of the dark things

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.410 align:middle line:90%
that we notice in human history.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what seems to
have triggered the dominator

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a book about this
called "The Alphabet Versus

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:90%
the Goddess.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is being
greatly transformed.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically the theory
is that once written alphabets

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:84%
were introduced, it
caused a imbalance

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:90%
to favor the left hemisphere.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:27.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the hemisphere that would
work with alphabets or numbers.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that's into linear
thinking and into hierarchy.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we start to
have patriarchal societies,

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
which are run by a
document, which could be

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.070 align:middle line:84%
"Hammurabi's Code," the
Bible, the "DSM-IV."

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It could be the US
Constitution, the rule of law.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And those societies tend
to be sort of anti-female

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.120 align:middle line:90%
and violent.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But right now, the explosion
of visual technologies

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
are making people
more bihemispheric.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And as bad as newspaper
headlines might seem,

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.480 align:middle line:84%
we live in the least violent
time in human history

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:90%
or pre-history right now.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:90%
The lowest.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:84%
As bad as what's
going on in Syria is,

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:84%
we have the lowest per
capita war death rate

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.880 align:middle line:90%
now that we've ever had.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why is that?

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, I mean, no
one can say for sure.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But I wonder if it
isn't because we're

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:90%
becoming more bihemispheric.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:90%
And so the visual media--

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:84%
even if it's a first-person
shooter video game,

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
regardless of the
objectionable content

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:84%
is making people more
holistic in their thinking,

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:35.030 align:middle line:84%
more feminine in their
values, and is overall,

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:84%
with certain notable
exceptions, making

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:84%
people more tolerant
and more accepting

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:90%
of diversity and other things.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.140 align:middle line:84%
For example, Leonard
Shlain points out

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:84%
that the whole modern rise
in the rights of women

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.700 align:middle line:84%
pretty much tracks perfectly
with the rise of television.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Yeah.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: And this
explosion of visual media

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:84%
is affecting us in
many profound ways.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.860 align:middle line:90%
We're becoming more visual.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And what these projections of
the future of the species--

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:13.940 align:middle line:84%
suggest visual telepathies and
a visual telepathic network.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is also what
people experience

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:90%
in their near-death experiences.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
They will have a
telepathic life review,

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.360 align:middle line:84%
where they are aware of
what other people were

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.550 align:middle line:84%
thinking and feeling who
were in the room with them.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They actually
feel this, too.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And their sense of vision
will be greatly enhanced.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Somebody may have a severe
astigmatism or something.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But they may have not
just panoramic vision,

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.260 align:middle line:90%
but sometimes spherical vision.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And people who were
congenitally blind since birth--

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Kenneth Ring wrote
about this with a co-author

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:90%
in the book "Mindsight."

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:50.150 align:middle line:84%
They may have completely
visually comprehended

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.410 align:middle line:90%
near-death experiences.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And they've never
experienced vision before.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And they may come
back and report, oh,

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:84%
now I know what
grandma looks like

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and be able to provide
veridical, visual information

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.172 align:middle line:84%
based on this
near-death experience.

00:23:04.172 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you talk
about near-death experiences.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Eben Alexander who wrote
the book "Proof of Heaven"

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.900 align:middle line:84%
was a guest of mine,
Jonathan, on "Beyond Belief."

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.500 align:middle line:10%
When you went to the other
side, what was it like?

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.640 align:middle line:10%
Describe it for us.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.098 align:middle line:10%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: Well, it all
started in a very primitive,

00:23:21.098 --> 00:23:23.560 align:middle line:10%
course, unresponsive realm
that I call the earthworm's eye

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:10%
view.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.270 align:middle line:10%
A very, very dark and murky
kind of course reality,

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.442 align:middle line:10%
like being in dirty Jell-O.

00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It sounds like hell.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:10%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: Well, people
often ask me when I got--

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You think
you would go there?

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.774 align:middle line:10%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: No.

00:23:35.774 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:10%
Well-- but it is part
of the spiritual realms.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:10%
And it's something we
have no need to fear.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:10%
But that fearlessness
is a crucial part

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:10%
of the lesson of my journey.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:10%
Turns out that
from that realm, I

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:10%
was rescued by a slowly
spinning white light, very clear

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.200 align:middle line:10%
that came bundled with a
perfect musical melody.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.660 align:middle line:10%
And that white light
opened up like a rip

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:10%
in the fabric of that ugly
earthworm eye view realm

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:10%
and led up into an all
too real valley, what

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:10%
I call the Gateway
Valley, that was filled

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:10%
with many earth-like features.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.360 align:middle line:10%
For example, there was
lots of plant life-- lush,

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.260 align:middle line:10%
growing, flowers
blossoming, buds on trees.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:10%
No sign of any death or decay.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:10%
Beautiful waterfalls
into sparkling pools.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:23.110 align:middle line:10%
Thousands of beings dancing
below, tremendous joy

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:10%
and merriment.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.690 align:middle line:10%
I saw them all as
souls between lives.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.230 align:middle line:10%
And I was witnessing it
all as a speck of awareness

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.852 align:middle line:10%
on a butterfly wing.

00:24:30.852 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:10%
There were millions
of other butterflies.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.034 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: By the side looking in?

00:24:34.034 --> 00:24:35.950 align:middle line:10%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: Looking
down on this valley.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:10%
And again, the
thing to stress, it

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:10%
was absolutely-- it was far
more real than this world.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.300 align:middle line:10%
This world is the dream.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.300 align:middle line:10%
This is the murky
kind of surreality.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:51.040 align:middle line:10%
That is the shocking reality
of our spiritual realm.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.440 align:middle line:10%
And it was all very much fueled.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:10%
Because up above in the sky
over this beautiful valley

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:10%
were these hooping
orbs of light,

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.950 align:middle line:10%
golden orbs leaving
sparkling trails

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:06.400 align:middle line:10%
of golden dust against the
blue-black velvety sky.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.030 align:middle line:10%
And these orbs were emanating
chants, and anthems, hymns.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.830 align:middle line:10%
It would thunder through me.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.710 align:middle line:10%
This incredible
astonishing power

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:10%
and majesty of the
unconditional love

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.950 align:middle line:10%
of the deity of
that realm, that God

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:22.224 align:middle line:10%
that drove every
bit of that journey.

00:25:22.224 --> 00:25:24.640 align:middle line:10%
And of course, there was a
beautiful girl on the butterfly

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.090 align:middle line:10%
wing who later proved
crucial in showing me

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.070 align:middle line:10%
the reality of the journey.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:10%
Many months after my coma,
it was identifying her

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.870 align:middle line:10%
that helped me to
understand it all.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:38.540 align:middle line:10%
But that was only a stepping
stone to higher levels.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, those angelic
choirs, the music from them

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:46.500 align:middle line:10%
provided yet another portal
music vibration frequency--

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.270 align:middle line:10%
are the way that our souls
transcend these realms.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:10%
And that particular
portal out of the valley

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:10%
led into pure oneness and
what I call the core realm--

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:10%
infinite, inky
blackness, but filled

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:10%
to overflowing with
the healing power

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:10%
of that divine loving creative
source, that God or deity.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I came back
calling that deity Om,

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:10%
because that was the sound
that I heard in that realm.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:10%
But it was just an
extraordinary spiritual journey.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.280 align:middle line:10%
And the most amazing
thing, of course,

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:10%
is that it happened when my
brain was demonstrably offline,

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:10%
when the neocortex was
known by my neurologic exams

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:10%
and by my scans.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:10%
My doctors knew that
I could not have had

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.120 align:middle line:10%
any kind of robust experience.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.030 align:middle line:10%
Because this was far
more real than anything

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.309 align:middle line:10%
I've ever experienced
in my existence.

00:26:36.309 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Quite a guy, Jonathan.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But how do we know
that experience

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:42.280 align:middle line:90%
that he felt was real was real?

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.727 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, first of all, as
he pointed out near the end--

00:26:45.727 --> 00:26:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of all, from the
phenomenological point of view,

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:90%
it's real.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And that he experienced
it and came back

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:90%
with a very vivid memory of it.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, from the point of view
of neurological materialism,

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:58.840 align:middle line:84%
you have no ability
to explain this.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So that neurological
materialism--

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.970 align:middle line:90%
these are the people.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's nothing
to compare it to.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, these
are the people.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in most of the academic
world and most of science,

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:84%
they just assume that if they
admit consciousness exists

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.080 align:middle line:90%
at all-- many of them don't--

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.470 align:middle line:90%
that it's just an epiphenomenon.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a secondary effect,
a biochemical process

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.280 align:middle line:90%
But now, here's a guy.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.482 align:middle line:84%
And I think he had meningitis
or some serious brain illness.

00:27:24.482 --> 00:27:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He went into a coma.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:29.309 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are people
who have done no--

00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:30.850 align:middle line:84%
have not done their
homework on that.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's just an
oxygen deprived brain.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, an oxygen
deprived brain doesn't

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:40.030 align:middle line:84%
store these extremely
complex memories and not just

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.490 align:middle line:84%
like an ordinary memory
of going to the store,

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:84%
but of seeing things
you've never seen before.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think of
the processing power

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.930 align:middle line:84%
if that were a movie to
make all that up on the fly.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:84%
The processing power that
would take of a brain.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this is a brain
that is in the worst

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:90%
shape it's ever been in.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Or if you consider like
the Pam Reynolds case

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
when she has no
blood in her brain.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:90%
She's completely flatlined.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.660 align:middle line:84%
There's no measurable
electrical activity there.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But she's able not just to
have her own complex inner

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.430 align:middle line:84%
experience like this,
but also to bring back

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:84%
veridical information
like things

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that were said in
the surgery room

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and what the Midas Rex
bone saw looked like,

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:22.760 align:middle line:84%
which is not what
she expected at all,

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:84%
or what an average
person would expect.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.335 align:middle line:90%
And her eyes were taped shut.

00:28:27.335 --> 00:28:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you explain that?

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, the
way I would explain

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:84%
it is that consciousness is
not located in the brain.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.234 align:middle line:90%
It does not need a body.

00:28:36.234 --> 00:28:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it in the heart?

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.325 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, I think
it's in something

00:28:40.325 --> 00:28:42.980 align:middle line:90%
like a non-local quantum field.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore,
this should take away

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:47.840 align:middle line:90%
a lot of fear of death.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Because the death
of the body does not

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.970 align:middle line:90%
threaten that consciousness.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not in the body.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:90%
It's associated with the body.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, the
condition of the body

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.070 align:middle line:84%
when it's tightly
associated with it, as

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.130 align:middle line:84%
in our normal waking state,
the condition-- the body

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.200 align:middle line:90%
will play a big part.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But when it's separated
from the body,

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:84%
like in an
out-of-body experience

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:84%
or in these profound
near-death experiences,

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.500 align:middle line:84%
consciousness can be
incredibly enhanced.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And he's describing many
of the classic things

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.890 align:middle line:84%
that people experience
where it's more real.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.050 align:middle line:84%
They see colors they
haven't seen before.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.150 align:middle line:84%
They feel like
they've come home.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they are
at their actual baseline.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And these experiences
have a high degree

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.165 align:middle line:84%
of thematic consistency,
one among others.

00:29:37.165 --> 00:29:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And these can
happen to children.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.880 align:middle line:84%
They happen to people
in other cultures.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.210 align:middle line:84%
We can find evidence of
them in the distant past.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.480 align:middle line:90%
And they are reflections.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.510 align:middle line:84%
They are individual reflections
of this singularity archetype

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.250 align:middle line:84%
which explains, by the way,
how these experiences--

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and this has been shown in
prospective studies that

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.886 align:middle line:84%
were published in
the journal "Lancet."

00:30:00.886 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:84%
The effect of the
near-death experience

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.910 align:middle line:90%
will increase over time.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:08.210 align:middle line:84%
A single hallucination
or a shocking event--

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.304 align:middle line:84%
the effect would
diminish over time.

00:30:10.304 --> 00:30:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
we know, Jonathan,

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:17.374 align:middle line:84%
that these things that are
happening to us are, one, real?

00:30:17.374 --> 00:30:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And you've done a
pretty good job trying

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.410 align:middle line:90%
to explain that in some cases.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.630 align:middle line:84%
But what do we do
with this information?

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:28.530 align:middle line:84%
How do we apply it
to our lifestyle?

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: OK.

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, good question.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So on the subject
of reality, I mean,

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.300 align:middle line:84%
there are a number of
different directions we can go.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:44.930 align:middle line:84%
For one, we have to look at
the subjective quality of what

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:84%
we consider real in
the waking world.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at you right now.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:84%
But literally what's
happening is studio lights

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.460 align:middle line:84%
are bouncing off of the
topography of your hair, skin,

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.390 align:middle line:90%
clothing.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:58.310 align:middle line:84%
That falls on the
back of my retina

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.080 align:middle line:84%
upside down, because
the cornea of my eye

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:90%
is a simple convex lens.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.440 align:middle line:84%
There's also a
hole in the middle

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.180 align:middle line:84%
of that retina, like
the digital sensor,

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.334 align:middle line:84%
almost, where there's
no photoreceptors.

00:31:08.334 --> 00:31:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where the
bundle of nerves goes

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.540 align:middle line:90%
back into the brain.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.820 align:middle line:84%
The brain just fills that
in with what it thinks

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:14.970 align:middle line:90%
would be in that space.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And then it turns that
image right side up.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm looking at
you, it looks so solid.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it's a
neurological reconstruction

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.530 align:middle line:90%
of a past event.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.447 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm actually
a hologram, anyway.

00:31:26.447 --> 00:31:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, I mean, that
makes it even more subjective.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.152 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Technology.

00:31:30.152 --> 00:31:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: But you see,
what I'm saying

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:84%
is what we normally experience
is far more dreamlike.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And philosophers
and neurologists

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.560 align:middle line:90%
all acknowledge this.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And so when we have
an inner experience,

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.520 align:middle line:84%
it's really no
less real than what

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.900 align:middle line:90%
we're experiencing out here.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Because this is also an
inner created experience.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't see all the wavelengths
of light and so forth.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a fact
as Jung pointed out.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.470 align:middle line:84%
If I tell you to think of
a pink elephant and you do,

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.249 align:middle line:84%
well, that may
seem like a nothing

00:32:05.249 --> 00:32:06.290 align:middle line:90%
that you thought of that.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:10.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's a fact that you had
pictured that particular thing

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.980 align:middle line:90%
at that particular moment.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's a fact and a
highly structured fact

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that he had this complex
inner experience.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Different people may want to
interpret it different ways.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I were
born blind, I wouldn't

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.620 align:middle line:84%
have that same experience
that you asked me to,

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.322 align:middle line:84%
because I'd have nothing
as a reference point.

00:32:27.322 --> 00:32:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't know what
a pink elephant was.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Exactly.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.210 align:middle line:84%
However, if you were having
a near-death experience

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.914 align:middle line:84%
and you were blind, then
you might for the first time

00:32:34.914 --> 00:32:35.955 align:middle line:90%
have a visual experience.

00:32:35.955 --> 00:32:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You might.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And we can't explain that from
materialist brain science.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Because here's a person whose
brain is in the worse shape

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:44.750 align:middle line:90%
it's ever been in.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And now for the
first time, they're

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.860 align:middle line:84%
going to have a visually
comprehended experience

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.420 align:middle line:90%
and have a complex memory of it.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have people and they
call "Coast to Coast," my radio

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:54.350 align:middle line:90%
show.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have
been born blind,

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.450 align:middle line:84%
so they never had an
opportunity to see anything.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:04.145 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk to them on the
air about color, for example.

00:33:04.145 --> 00:33:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, in your
mind, what is red?

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And they have no basis for that.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.180 align:middle line:90%
So I tried it in, what is blue?

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.050 align:middle line:90%
They have no basis.

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So I'll try to say
the sky is blue.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.230 align:middle line:90%
That's the color of the sky.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:22.950 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have
the reference point

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.510 align:middle line:90%
to see what that blue is.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:27.250 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what color is.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Everything is black.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:29.412 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:33:29.412 --> 00:33:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to be
able to put ourselves

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.290 align:middle line:84%
in the mind of another
and to find out

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:37.360 align:middle line:84%
what that experience
is for another person.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But the last part
of your question,

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.080 align:middle line:84%
though, about, what should
we do with these experiences?

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do we do with it?

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: OK.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing is--
and I've actually

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:47.370 align:middle line:84%
written about this in my book
"Crossing the Event Horizon."

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:48.415 align:middle line:90%
There's a section.

00:33:48.415 --> 00:33:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great
title, by the way.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Well, thank you.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: There's a
section that's called--

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.430 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe I called this
on the website version

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.930 align:middle line:90%
of this chapter--

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.820 align:middle line:84%
"Life Lessons from
the Living Dead,"

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.880 align:middle line:84%
where people come back from
near-death experiences.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And there is high
thematic consistency

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.380 align:middle line:84%
in how their lives
change and what

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:84%
they say about how to live
your life differently,

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:08.519 align:middle line:90%
like the question you asked.

00:34:08.519 --> 00:34:08.987 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:08.987 --> 00:34:09.969 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Exactly.

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:14.440 align:middle line:84%
What they all say is that
this is like a school.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.360 align:middle line:84%
We're here to learn
and to develop

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.050 align:middle line:84%
in a very difficult plane
of reality to incarnate in.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.260 align:middle line:84%
We are here to develop
ourselves to become more

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.969 align:middle line:90%
conscious to grow ourselves.

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:28.219 align:middle line:84%
And the other great purpose
is to help other people,

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:31.100 align:middle line:84%
especially with that,
but with anything.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.699 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
ways in which we

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:35.110 align:middle line:90%
can live our lives differently.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And one way-- and this is part
of "The Afterlife Revolution,"

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.630 align:middle line:84%
is to communicate more
and learn more about

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:47.290 align:middle line:84%
what's going on, on the other
side of that event horizon.

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.239 align:middle line:84%
So think about it
this way, George.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:53.080 align:middle line:84%
If an alien were to say, show
me a picture of a human being

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and we show him a
picture of me at my age,

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
or we show him a picture
of a baby or something,

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:02.170 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of misinforming,
because there's

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:03.220 align:middle line:90%
a human lifecycle.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.670 align:middle line:84%
You don't always look like
you're 50, or 20, or whatever.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, once I saw some
kind of Hindu painting

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.060 align:middle line:84%
that showed what would
be a better picture

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:11.860 align:middle line:90%
to show an alien.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.422 align:middle line:84%
It shows a fetus connected
to a baby, connected

00:35:15.422 --> 00:35:16.880 align:middle line:84%
to a child,
adolescent, grown man--

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It shows the
stage of growth, right?

00:35:18.755 --> 00:35:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: --old man, corpse,
skeleton, and so forth.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're sort of seeing
a more complete lifecycle.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:27.310 align:middle line:84%
However, this is
still showing us only

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:90%
between conception and death.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And we have much evidence
and reports in every culture

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
that that's not the
complete lifecycle.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So just like certain
animals like marsupials

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.040 align:middle line:84%
are limited in their
evolution because their two

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.510 align:middle line:84%
hemispheres can't communicate,
we may be limited as a species.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we can't
communicate most of the time

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.140 align:middle line:84%
with the 80 billion or so,
depending on who you believe,

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:84%
human beings who have
passed that event horizon.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:59.950 align:middle line:84%
However, we are living
in the golden age

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.812 align:middle line:84%
of such communication, and
exploration, and research.

00:36:03.812 --> 00:36:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, there
are plenty of charlatans.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:10.150 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of nonsensical
or exploitative attempts

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to communicate or purport to
communicate with the deceased.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:16.030 align:middle line:84%
But we have never
had so many people

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:20.500 align:middle line:84%
bring back so much testimony
you have been clinically dead.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And so one way to live
our lives differently

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.110 align:middle line:84%
is to increase the
flow of information

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.830 align:middle line:84%
across this other
great hemisphere.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the shows
that you do are so important.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Because they are helping
people with the tools

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and hearing the testimony of
people who've had those kind

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:42.840 align:middle line:90%
of experiences.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
take that knowledge

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.290 align:middle line:90%
and apply it to their life?

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.990 align:middle line:84%
They should, but how many
people actually use it?

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, it's a
minority of persons.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But the esoteric work and
the work on consciousness

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.120 align:middle line:84%
has always been
a minority thing,

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.670 align:middle line:90%
but it's a substantial minority.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people have
experiences like when

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:06.730 align:middle line:90%
they've done Gallup polls.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Something like 85%
of Americans will

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.590 align:middle line:84%
say that they have had
something that they

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:15.340 align:middle line:84%
consider an experience of
contact with a departed

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.547 align:middle line:90%
loved one.

00:37:16.547 --> 00:37:17.380 align:middle line:90%
However, they live--

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is huge.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: --in a culture where
people don't follow up on that,

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:26.170 align:middle line:84%
or give them tools to increase
the communication and so forth.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And where people have
had exceptionally good

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.050 align:middle line:90%
communication--

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:35.050 align:middle line:84%
they have brought back
exceptionally good information.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've recently
interviewed our friend Whitley

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Strieber with his
continuing relationship

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.340 align:middle line:90%
with his wife, Anne.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But an even more extraordinary
case of communication

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:50.500 align:middle line:84%
came sort of at the tail end
of the Spiritualist movement

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.880 align:middle line:84%
in the 1930s and '40s with a
guy named Stewart Edward White.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.310 align:middle line:84%
This was a guy who was a friend
of Teddy Roosevelt-- very

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.510 align:middle line:84%
successful-- didn't need
to get into any of this.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:03.740 align:middle line:84%
He was a successful writer of
adventure stories and so forth.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:84%
But he and his wife,
Betty, were both very

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.860 align:middle line:90%
rigorous paranormal researchers.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And Betty, before she
died, was a medium

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and had contact with
spirits on the other side

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:18.370 align:middle line:90%
she called the Invisibles.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, after she passed,
she almost immediately

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:24.760 align:middle line:84%
was able to speak
through a medium that

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.250 align:middle line:84%
was known to both of them when
they were both alive named

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Joan, but was able
to provide volumes

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:33.940 align:middle line:84%
of veridical information,
telling Stewart things that are

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:90%
only known to the two of them.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
telling things

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.131 align:middle line:84%
that were not known to
anybody present in the room.

00:38:40.131 --> 00:38:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
they know, right?

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:42.715 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right, exactly.

00:38:42.715 --> 00:38:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And whole books were written.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And the most powerful-- you
read most of them free online.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.521 align:middle line:84%
The most powerful, I think,
is called "The Unobstructed

00:38:49.521 --> 00:38:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Universe," where
these Invisibles--

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:56.800 align:middle line:84%
a whole literal college of them
explains how time is different

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.660 align:middle line:84%
when you're over
there as compared

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.140 align:middle line:84%
to here, how the physics
of the other side

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.180 align:middle line:90%
differs compared to here.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's highly consistent
with a lot of other reports.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
speaking of mediums,

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:10.900 align:middle line:84%
James Van Praagh, appearing
on a Gaia television

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.250 align:middle line:90%
program with Lisa Garr.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: OK.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:90%


00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.370 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: If we've
lost a loved one,

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.770 align:middle line:10%
could we then communicate
to our loved ones

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:20.790 align:middle line:10%
through those memories?

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:21.550 align:middle line:10%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Yes, we can.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.730 align:middle line:10%
There is easy ways to
communicate with spirit.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.710 align:middle line:10%
People think you need
a medium to do it.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:26.690 align:middle line:10%
Not necessarily.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.731 align:middle line:10%
Now, a medium is someone
who is able to hear them

00:39:28.731 --> 00:39:31.680 align:middle line:10%
clearly and really be able to
translate what they're saying--

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.080 align:middle line:10%
translate the images,
the impressions.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.390 align:middle line:10%
But everybody can hear
from their loved ones.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:38.440 align:middle line:10%
For instance, when you
go to sleep at night,

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.662 align:middle line:10%
ask they come to your dreams.

00:39:39.662 --> 00:39:41.370 align:middle line:10%
That's the number one
way to communicate.

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:43.453 align:middle line:10%
It's the dream state, so
come through your dreams.

00:39:43.453 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:10%
You'll have a dream of them.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.520 align:middle line:10%
Or keep a journal
next to your bed

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.350 align:middle line:10%
and try meditating, quieting
the mind, and listen to them.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.330 align:middle line:10%
And they'll start
writing a message to you.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.800 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Why would they
come through our dreams?

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.510 align:middle line:10%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
It's the easiest way

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.885 align:middle line:10%
to get through,
because we're not

00:39:55.885 --> 00:39:57.630 align:middle line:10%
on our rational, conscious mind.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:59.010 align:middle line:10%
We're not in the critical mind.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:02.100 align:middle line:10%
That little mind chatter says,
oh, this can't possibly be.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.800 align:middle line:10%
That left brain-- the left part
of just analyzing everything,

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.940 align:middle line:10%
critiquing everything.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.280 align:middle line:10%
We're not in that space,
pretty much away from that,

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.249 align:middle line:10%
so it's easy to
drop something in.

00:40:10.249 --> 00:40:11.790 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: And
we're not in a place

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:16.590 align:middle line:10%
of being able to move either,
so our minds are pretty clear.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.654 align:middle line:10%
I mean, one of the
wonderful reasons that I'd

00:40:19.654 --> 00:40:21.570 align:middle line:10%
love to have you on the
show-- and your here--

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.840 align:middle line:10%
is so that people who are
in that space of grief

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.030 align:middle line:10%
can get some
communication and maybe

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.660 align:middle line:10%
try some things on their own.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.410 align:middle line:10%
That's why I love what you do.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:middle line:10%
Because-- I mean,
people try this

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.650 align:middle line:10%
in the privacy of their own
home in their quietest hours.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.040 align:middle line:10%
I heard this person talk
and maybe this works.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:10%
And let me just try this.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.360 align:middle line:10%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: But they
have to be consistent about it.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.020 align:middle line:10%
They can't be just--

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:43.990 align:middle line:10%
OK, I'm going to
do this tonight,

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:45.740 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to have
results right away.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:46.540 align:middle line:10%
No, no, no.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.370 align:middle line:10%
It's really a process.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.240 align:middle line:10%
And it's a process, if you
will, training the mind also

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.074 align:middle line:10%
to be open.

00:40:52.074 --> 00:40:53.490 align:middle line:10%
Because a lot of
us have a tough--

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.490 align:middle line:10%
a lot of trouble
quieting the minds.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:57.360 align:middle line:10%
We have to train the
mind to quiet down.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.305 align:middle line:10%
The more you do it, the
better you get at it.

00:41:00.305 --> 00:41:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think,
Jonathan, we can communicate

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:03.690 align:middle line:90%
with the other side?

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Absolutely.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have my
own experiences,

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:08.130 align:middle line:90%
which I don't talk about much.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:12.300 align:middle line:84%
They're not as veridical as some
of the best documented cases.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.370 align:middle line:90%
But James is right.

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.210 align:middle line:84%
There are things you can
definitely do that will greatly

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:19.305 align:middle line:90%
improve the possibility.

00:41:19.305 --> 00:41:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, first of all, in many
times the communication

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:84%
happens without
people doing anything.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.322 align:middle line:90%
People will have--

00:41:26.322 --> 00:41:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they
least expect it.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right, exactly.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Often it's when
they're driving a car.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And that may be because they're
in a relaxed, trance-like

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:34.020 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's often
soon after someone

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.890 align:middle line:90%
they were very close to passes.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And they will feel
this presence,

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:41.540 align:middle line:90%
or they will hear about, I'm OK.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they hear a
song on the radio that was

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.694 align:middle line:90%
that person's favorite song.

00:41:45.694 --> 00:41:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Or smell a perfume that's
not present in the environment,

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.290 align:middle line:84%
but that belonged to
the deceased grandmother

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:51.090 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:52.464 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
different ways.

00:41:52.464 --> 00:41:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And often it will just
happen very vividly,

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:59.820 align:middle line:84%
very spontaneously, completely
unexpectedly, but often only

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.740 align:middle line:90%
in a single instance.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, where it gets more
interesting is where--

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.300 align:middle line:84%
as I've experienced-- been
experiencing in my life

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:12.516 align:middle line:84%
and with Stewart Edward White
where there's ongoing contact.

00:42:12.516 --> 00:42:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And so some of
the things you can

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:15.348 align:middle line:84%
do-- so it's like
I've been working

00:42:15.348 --> 00:42:17.615 align:middle line:90%
with dreams for decades.

00:42:17.615 --> 00:42:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, how come
I can't remember my dreams?

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, wake up in a dark room.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:26.130 align:middle line:84%
The sense impressions
will just wipe out

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:29.190 align:middle line:84%
the memory of the dream,
because they're so powerful.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So if we are in a
distracting environment,

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.920 align:middle line:84%
then we're not going
to be able to tune

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.980 align:middle line:90%
in to subtle telepathies.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Because out of a
survival instinct,

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.130 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be processing
the 3D worlds coming at us

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:45.130 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of thing.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:48.600 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in a quiet
room in a meditative state--

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I like pre-dawn.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I get up pre-dawn almost
every day to write.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.880 align:middle line:90%
That is the zone.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
creative zone for you?

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Yeah.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.336 align:middle line:84%
And it's also like the
witching hour of 3:00 o'clock

00:42:57.336 --> 00:42:58.810 align:middle line:90%
in the morning and so forth.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:02.190 align:middle line:84%
The window between
the worlds seems

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:04.800 align:middle line:84%
to be much more
open at that time.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Most people in the community
are in the dreamtime.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So you have less
mundane consciousness

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.220 align:middle line:90%
going on around you.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm just getting
home from the radio show

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:90%
right about then.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So while you're
writing, I'm driving.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.564 align:middle line:84%
But you're also
speaking to people

00:43:18.564 --> 00:43:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and speaking about
this phenomenon

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:24.810 align:middle line:84%
during some of that window kind
of zone, that nighthawk zone.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And so when you--

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.760 align:middle line:84%
showing up-- in a lot of things
in life, it's about showing up.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you show up in that zone
where you could hear things,

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and then when you start
to get a little bit better

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:84%
at recognizing and
being able to work

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.990 align:middle line:84%
with telepathic
communication, part of it

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.630 align:middle line:84%
is being able to
tolerate ambiguity.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the average
person will want to like,

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.954 align:middle line:90%
OK, give me some evidence.

00:43:52.954 --> 00:43:54.120 align:middle line:90%
And they want to erase all--

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want
that evidence.

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: --the ambiguity.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how
much of it you get,

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.420 align:middle line:84%
you always want more, as
what Strieber points out

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.290 align:middle line:90%
in his recent book.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:04.290 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he gets one
sign, he wants another one.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the barrier
to this is that we're

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:10.960 align:middle line:84%
living in the physical 3D
world most of the time.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, our
senses are confronting us

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.910 align:middle line:84%
with so much reality
that is not in accord

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.520 align:middle line:90%
with the presence of the other.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.770 align:middle line:84%
But writing things
down when you do

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:25.550 align:middle line:84%
get messages,
recording that helps

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.340 align:middle line:90%
to make it far more definite.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And so there are many
different techniques.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And some may be introduced
by new technologies.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Virtual reality
is probably going

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.300 align:middle line:84%
to be a tremendous
catalyst for this.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it gets better,
and better, and better.

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.230 align:middle line:90%
It's in its infancy right now.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
seen the movie "2001--

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.210 align:middle line:90%
A Space Odyssey."

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And you have some
tie-ins with that.

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.340 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, depending on how
deep you want to go,

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.496 align:middle line:84%
we can go through the plot of
the whole movie if you want.

00:44:55.496 --> 00:44:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it has
tie-ins to everything

00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:58.130 align:middle line:90%
that we've talked about.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did Kubrick know?

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, it was the
collaboration of these two

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:07.040 align:middle line:84%
great geniuses, Arthur C.
Clarke and Stanley Kubrick,

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.380 align:middle line:90%
both of them famous atheists.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:13.070 align:middle line:84%
But in this story, we
find all of these themes

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:14.000 align:middle line:90%
coming together.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be
some plot spoilers,

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:18.950 align:middle line:84%
but most people have probably
already really seen the movie.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:22.430 align:middle line:84%
But we start out and
with a kind of tombstone.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So the connection to
death is always there.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.575 align:middle line:84%
We see this black monolith
sticking out of the ground

00:45:26.575 --> 00:45:26.810 align:middle line:90%
the like a tombstone.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:27.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's right,
the monolith, right?

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:29.090 align:middle line:10%
>>ZAP: Right, exactly.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:29.956 align:middle line:10%
The monolith.

00:45:29.956 --> 00:45:31.580 align:middle line:10%
And our friend, Jay
Weidner, of course,

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.400 align:middle line:10%
has written extensively
about this, too.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.300 align:middle line:10%
And we see some missing link
hominids dancing around this--

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.910 align:middle line:10%
what's an
extraterrestrial artifact

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:44.660 align:middle line:10%
that's been sent to rewire
their brains somehow.

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And after they've been
exposed to this object,

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.720 align:middle line:84%
they've now been
enhanced as compared

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.610 align:middle line:84%
to the other missing link
hominids in the neighborhood.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost
human-like, right?

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, they're
almost human like,

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.388 align:middle line:90%
but they don't have language.

00:45:57.388 --> 00:45:59.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem
to have tool use.

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But now, suddenly after
this event occurs,

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.020 align:middle line:90%
now they discover tool use.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:07.520 align:middle line:84%
You see one of them picking up a
large bone and using it to club

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.640 align:middle line:90%
these pig-like animals.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.550 align:middle line:90%
And they discover tools.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they are attacked by
a identical-looking hominid

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:15.110 align:middle line:90%
tribe.

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And the alpha of that
tribe comes forward

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.770 align:middle line:84%
to fight the alpha
of the tribe that's

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:20.660 align:middle line:90%
been exposed to the monolith.

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And the alpha of
the enhanced tribe

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:27.390 align:middle line:84%
picks up one of these bone clubs
and bludgeons the other one

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:28.190 align:middle line:90%
to death.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So then they have an
evolutionary advantage.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our Gaia show
"Hollywood Decoded"

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.350 align:middle line:90%
talks a little bit about that.

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Oh, really?

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.590 align:middle line:10%
>> That process, though, is
aimed at trying to transcend

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:41.637 align:middle line:10%
these limitations, that
initiatory process.

00:46:41.637 --> 00:46:43.970 align:middle line:10%
And this is what's going to
happen to Bowman when Bowman

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:45.770 align:middle line:10%
enters into the Stargate.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:49.670 align:middle line:10%
He's going to see this dazzling,
psychedelic light show that's

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:53.050 align:middle line:10%
kind of the fabric or
structure of reality.

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:55.580 align:middle line:10%
And he's going to see these
sort of platonic forms, right?

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.077 align:middle line:10%
Pythagorean forms.

00:46:57.077 --> 00:46:58.535 align:middle line:10%
And so we want to
look at that clip

00:46:58.535 --> 00:46:59.743 align:middle line:10%
of him entering the Stargate.

00:46:59.743 --> 00:47:03.149 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:03.149 --> 00:47:09.970 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:13.900 align:middle line:10%
>> So while I understand
that this is far prior

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:18.130 align:middle line:10%
to the "Matrix," I read this
as the universe itself being

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:20.110 align:middle line:10%
constructed in a
kind of platonic way.

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:23.290 align:middle line:10%
That there's this kind of
three-dimensional cubic reality

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:25.360 align:middle line:10%
that we've been talking
about that limits us.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.120 align:middle line:10%
And here is Bowman
moving out of that.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.820 align:middle line:10%
And you can go all the way
back to Plato's "Dialogues"

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.490 align:middle line:10%
like the "Timaeus," which
is his creation account.

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:35.170 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know
how he knew this,

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:37.010 align:middle line:10%
or Socrates knew
this, or whoever.

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:40.340 align:middle line:10%
But somehow, way
before microscopes,

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:44.440 align:middle line:10%
they posited the theory that
the lowest levels of reality

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.950 align:middle line:10%
are actually formal,
that they have form.

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:48.700 align:middle line:10%
So you can look at it
like a benzene ring.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.370 align:middle line:10%
It has that hexagonal
structure to it, right?

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.510 align:middle line:10%
So how they knew
that, I don't know.

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:55.900 align:middle line:10%
But I think there's always
been this sort of sense maybe

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.950 align:middle line:10%
contained within
comparative religion,

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:00.550 align:middle line:10%
or religious traditions,
or Hermetic traditions.

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:03.940 align:middle line:10%
The reality, really,
is this structure.

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.130 align:middle line:10%
It really does have
this architecture.

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:08.285 align:middle line:10%
It's a fabric of
light in a way, much

00:48:08.285 --> 00:48:09.660 align:middle line:10%
like what we see
in the "Matrix,"

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.150 align:middle line:10%
and that it can be transcended.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:13.170 align:middle line:84%
There are other
planes of existence.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think those
lights would drive me crazy,

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Jonathan, if I saw those
coming at me like that.

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, I mean, he's in
a state of ontological shock.

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:22.750 align:middle line:90%
You see him there.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And his mind is
completely blown.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.950 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back a little
bit further in the movie.

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:32.190 align:middle line:84%
After these-- back
to the missing links.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:35.470 align:middle line:84%
The alpha kills the other
alpha, throws the bone club up

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:36.270 align:middle line:90%
in the air.

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:37.945 align:middle line:10%
And in a gesture of triumph--

00:48:37.945 --> 00:48:39.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Slow
motion we see that.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.600 align:middle line:10%
>>ZAP: --we follow the bone.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.780 align:middle line:10%
And then in a 30
second of a second--

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.640 align:middle line:10%
that's the frame
rate of the film--

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.210 align:middle line:10%
100,000 years or something
of evolution are spliced out.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And now, we see a bone white
spacecraft orbiting the earth.

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And an interesting fact
is that actually it

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.850 align:middle line:84%
was Kubrick and
Clarke's intention

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that that be an orbiting
nuclear weapons platform.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.650 align:middle line:84%
They chose not to emphasize
it, because remember

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:08.560 align:middle line:84%
what Kubrick's previous
film was "Dr. Strangelove."

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.977 align:middle line:84%
It would be-- two
nuclear doomsday

00:49:09.977 --> 00:49:12.143 align:middle line:84%
things in a row would be
too much, so they died out.

00:49:12.143 --> 00:49:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He died during
"Eyes Wide Shut," didn't he?

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Yes, he did.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe.

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: What a loss
of great genius.

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So then we have another
monolith appears.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.260 align:middle line:84%
But this time this one has
been buried on the moon.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:27.580 align:middle line:84%
It's been set up so that when
we were technologically evolved

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.830 align:middle line:84%
enough where we could map
the moon's magnetic field,

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:33.100 align:middle line:84%
we discover a magnetic
anomaly-- dig this one up.

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:36.280 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we dig it up-- and
they're kind of taking selfies

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.010 align:middle line:84%
in front of it-- the
astronauts and so forth--

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:43.000 align:middle line:84%
it sends out a
powerful radio signal

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.120 align:middle line:90%
to lapetus, a moon of Jupiter.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.770 align:middle line:84%
They actually wanted
to do it-- have

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.930 align:middle line:84%
it be a moon of Saturn,
which archetypally would

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:51.055 align:middle line:90%
have been more appropriate.

00:49:51.055 --> 00:49:54.010 align:middle line:84%
But the state of the
art special effects--

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:55.742 align:middle line:84%
Douglas Trumbull's
industrial-like magic

00:49:55.742 --> 00:49:57.950 align:middle line:84%
didn't think they could pull
off the rings of Saturn.

00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:59.240 align:middle line:90%
So it becomes a ring of Jupiter.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They could now.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: They could now.

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if they did a remake of
that now if Kubrick was alive.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So they send down a spacecraft
called the Discovery One

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.270 align:middle line:90%
to go to that moon.

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:12.394 align:middle line:84%
And the Discovery One-- if
you see a picture of it,

00:50:12.394 --> 00:50:14.470 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a
human sperm cell.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.360 align:middle line:84%
So it has this
evolutionary aspect--

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.450 align:middle line:84%
a single sperm cell
going out through space.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have a war
between two competing streams

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.049 align:middle line:84%
of evolution that we
are undergoing right now

00:50:26.049 --> 00:50:27.340 align:middle line:90%
and people are concerned about.

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:31.640 align:middle line:90%
And that is AI versus us.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And who wins?

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, we do,
but very narrowly.

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:40.240 align:middle line:84%
It comes down-- most of the
astronauts on board Discovery

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.510 align:middle line:84%
One are killed by the
HAL 9000 computer.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a 0-1 survival
game between the last surviving

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:49.910 align:middle line:90%
astronaut Bowman--

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dave?

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Dave Bowman and HAL.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.810 align:middle line:90%
And Bowman wins.

00:50:55.810 --> 00:51:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And now, when he is approaching
as the last surviving entity--

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.480 align:middle line:90%
is approaching Iapetus.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.370 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a giant eye.

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:08.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of connection
here with eyes and with vision.

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And the pupil of
that eye is actually

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.390 align:middle line:90%
an enormous black monolith.

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:17.307 align:middle line:84%
And then when he lands
on it, it's like this--

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:18.640 align:middle line:90%
it's actually called a Stargate.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time we
hear that phrase Stargate.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.120 align:middle line:84%
When he enters it, he enters
this interdimensional corridor

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.630 align:middle line:84%
where his mind is blown, as
we saw in that film clip.

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And now, we see an incredible
and uncanny intersection

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.600 align:middle line:84%
with near-death
experience research.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.870 align:middle line:90%
But remember the timeline.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Both the novel and the movie--
created 1968 simultaneously.

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Long time ago.

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: OK, seven years before
the publication of Raymond

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Moody's "Life After Life."

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And yet, what we see
is the light tunnel.

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:56.437 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, I give examples
of near-death experiences,

00:51:56.437 --> 00:51:58.270 align:middle line:84%
talking about what the
light tunnel is like.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And I place that alongside
the description in the novel.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And you almost can't
tell them apart,

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.520 align:middle line:84%
except that Arthur C. Clarke
is a better writer than most

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.170 align:middle line:90%
near-death experiencers.

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes
through a life review.

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, the
term life review

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.520 align:middle line:90%
had not been coined till 1975.

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.326 align:middle line:84%
Here we have two atheist
geniuses, Kubrick and Clarke.

00:52:18.326 --> 00:52:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Way ahead
of their time.

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Yeah.

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have a sci-fi
futuristic thing,

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:27.940 align:middle line:84%
but it has incredible parallels
to near-death experience.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.600 align:middle line:84%
But that supports my idea
of a Singularity Archetype

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that relates to both of
those event horizons.

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.426 align:middle line:90%
And then we have--

00:52:36.426 --> 00:52:38.050 align:middle line:84%
even more like a
near-death experience,

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:40.180 align:middle line:84%
we have these
out-of-body experiences.

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.470 align:middle line:84%
He shows up into
this virtual reality

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:46.990 align:middle line:84%
kind of hotel room
with a lighted floor

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and like the Louis
Katsoris furniture.

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:50.980 align:middle line:90%
And he starts to hear a sound.

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And he sees an older
man who looks like him,

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.550 align:middle line:84%
but as an older
man eating dinner.

00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And now, he becomes
that older man.

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:05.200 align:middle line:10%
And now, the older man is
there and hears another sound.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.370 align:middle line:10%
And he looks over to the
right and sees a bedroom.

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:13.840 align:middle line:10%
And in there is an
extremely, profoundly old man

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.261 align:middle line:10%
on his deathbed.

00:53:15.261 --> 00:53:17.260 align:middle line:10%
So here, again, we have
the connection to death.

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.730 align:middle line:10%
And now, on the
deathbed, then, we

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:22.240 align:middle line:10%
become the point of view
of that extremely aged man.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And now, on the deathbed,
just like a tombstone,

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.530 align:middle line:90%
is a black monolith.

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:29.410 align:middle line:10%
It is both the Stargate
and the tombstone.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:32.132 align:middle line:10%
It is an evolutionary event
horizon, but it's the end of--

00:53:32.132 --> 00:53:33.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The
beginning and the end.

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:34.560 align:middle line:10%
>>ZAP: --life-- of death.

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.360 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.180 align:middle line:10%
And once he passes
through that, that's

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:40.660 align:middle line:10%
when he becomes the Star
Child, a luminous being

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:41.540 align:middle line:10%
in an orb of light.

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:44.040 align:middle line:10%
Think of how much talk there's
been about the force of life.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The fetus
sucking its thumb, right?

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.680 align:middle line:10%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.920 align:middle line:10%
And becomes-- and out with huge
eyes, almost like a gray alien.

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.450 align:middle line:10%
And he is now the
new evolutionary form

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:57.520 align:middle line:10%
having passed through
both death and

00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:00.550 align:middle line:10%
a interdimensional Stargate.

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something-- a journey
we are all going to take.

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:04.705 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Exactly.

00:54:04.705 --> 00:54:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And we should have
every reason to be

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:08.710 align:middle line:84%
excited about that
journey, especially

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:10.300 align:middle line:90%
if we live our lives well.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we have
such solid evidence

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:19.240 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness does not
require a living human body,

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.820 align:middle line:90%
and that we will be enhanced.

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Those of us who have led
lives that we're not just

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.570 align:middle line:84%
disintegrated completely
while we're alive spiritually,

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:31.300 align:middle line:84%
it seems, will be enhanced
by that experience.

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you have
an out-of-body experience.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a terrible fear
of death when I was a child.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But then after a few spontaneous
out-of-body experiences,

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.340 align:middle line:90%
I realized I'm so much more.

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not
afraid of dying?

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: No.

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not at all.

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:46.983 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: I'm afraid of the stuff
that could lead up to it.

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:48.595 align:middle line:84%
I'm intimidated by
aging, and illness,

00:54:48.595 --> 00:54:49.720 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.803 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's sick and
infirm and stuff like that.

00:54:51.803 --> 00:54:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Exactly.

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:58.040 align:middle line:84%
But I'm excited about
death as the great portal.

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And as we wrap this
up, Jonathan, one last question.

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is, when we
all get to this point--

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and we will-- if
we're in our deathbed,

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:12.130 align:middle line:84%
or wherever we may
be, what should we

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:17.050 align:middle line:84%
be thinking about moments
before we stop breathing?

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:22.871 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, thinking about
where we want to go next.

00:55:22.871 --> 00:55:24.370 align:middle line:84%
I think the time
to think about it--

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:26.453 align:middle line:84%
I tell this to people all
the time is when they're

00:55:26.453 --> 00:55:28.130 align:middle line:84%
making a big decision,
ask yourself,

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:30.520 align:middle line:84%
will you remember this
well on your deathbed?

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.350 align:middle line:90%
You want to be--

00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:35.830 align:middle line:84%
many people who even haven't
lived such good lives

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:38.647 align:middle line:84%
show great signs of
peacefulness and awareness

00:55:38.647 --> 00:55:40.480 align:middle line:84%
of other departed people
on their deathbeds.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.900 align:middle line:84%
We also have people who were
in a state of profound dementia

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.410 align:middle line:84%
with profound brain damage who
haven't been lucid in years

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:50.830 align:middle line:84%
become completely lucid,
according to hospice workers,

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:55.360 align:middle line:84%
minutes before they die, which
is inexplainable medically.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Because their brain should
be in the worst shape ever.

00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But they'll become
completely lucid.

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So we can set an
intention, but things

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:06.410 align:middle line:90%
may happen spontaneously.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So even if you're a
technological person like Steve

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Jobs, his last words were--

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, wow.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.259 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Oh, wow.

00:56:15.259 --> 00:56:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did he see?

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: What to think of may
come to us from the other side.

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:22.150 align:middle line:10%
We may already be
in a place where

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:25.480 align:middle line:10%
we are being guided, because
so many people report contact

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:28.790 align:middle line:10%
with others in the hours
or days before they die.

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:31.942 align:middle line:10%
And so we may be helped in
knowing what to think about

00:56:31.942 --> 00:56:32.900 align:middle line:10%
in those final moments.

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
find you, Jonathan?

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: My website
is zaporacle.com.

00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:39.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Z-A-P?

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:42.760 align:middle line:10%
>>ZAP: O-R-A-C-L-E.com.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.960 align:middle line:10%
And they can find my book on
Amazon and the usual places.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I also write for
an online magazine

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:48.700 align:middle line:90%
called "Reality Sandwich."

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.055 align:middle line:84%
You find 140 articles I've
written on various topics.

00:56:52.055 --> 00:56:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Come on back
again, would you?

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.659 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Thank you, I'd love to.

00:56:55.659 --> 00:56:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jonathan, thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:59.114 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Thank you very much.

00:56:59.114 --> 00:57:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you've heard it.

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.580 align:middle line:84%
When the lights go
out, close your eyes.

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:07.070 align:middle line:10%
And the lights will come back
on again until the end of time.

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
