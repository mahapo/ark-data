00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Susan Grau is with us.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.720 align:middle line:10%
She is a near-death experience
expert, intuitive medium,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.300 align:middle line:10%
and grief specialist.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.150 align:middle line:10%
She's also the author of an
incredible book, Infinite Life,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:10%
Infinite Lessons, which explores
the spirit world, living, dying,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:10%
and the in-between.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Susan, welcome to the program.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSAN GRAU: Thank you.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the in-between?

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, we have
birth, we have death,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and then we have the
living in-between.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.870 align:middle line:10%
And that's when we
learn all our lessons.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:10%
It's all our experiences.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Children or newborns are the
closest to the spirit world.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And people who are
leaving this planet

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:84%
are the closest to
the spirit world.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:10%
But everything in between,
we limit our beliefs

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:10%
and so we end up
not being as close.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:10%
And so I talk about
that in my book a lot.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.662 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in this, all of this?

00:01:09.662 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, when I was a
little girl, I could see animals

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.565 align:middle line:90%
float when they would pass away.

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: And we had land.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.647 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I thought
that was normal.

00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't even think
I thought anything.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:90%
It was just my normal.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But at 4 and 1/2 years old,
I was locked in an unplugged

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.052 align:middle line:84%
freezer in a garage, and I had
a very profound experience.

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long were
you in that thing?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.135 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: They said,
well, anywhere

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:31.420 align:middle line:90%
from 20 minutes to 2 hours.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's somewhere
in-between, I'm sure.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.643 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you pass out?

00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Oh, yeah.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:90%
I left.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a
near-death experience.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Absolutely.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At that age.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes, it was--

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you
think was happening to you?

00:01:44.602 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, first,
I just thought

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I was locked in a freezer
and I was panicked.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I was screaming and I saw three
lights and a very profound one

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.130 align:middle line:90%
said, stop screaming.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't listen.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%
I kept screaming.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.142 align:middle line:90%
And I was terrified.

00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who found you?

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: My mother.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:90%
My mother.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.603 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were looking
for you for hours, I bet.

00:02:04.603 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: No, she actually was in
the back of the house and heard,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:84%
"your baby is in the
freezer," and she ignored it.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And then she heard it again
about 20 minutes later

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:90%
and she ignored it.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And then she said
time went by and she

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
heard what she thought
was my voice saying it.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And she ran out and flew
the garage door open

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.557 align:middle line:84%
and ran in and
opened the freezer.

00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's one of the
most incredible stories

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:90%
I've ever heard.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: I know.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What got you in there?

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: I was playing
fort with some boys,

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and they told me if I
climbed up and got popsicles,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:84%
they'd let me play
more with them.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:90%
They were a little bit older.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I climbed up into the
freezer and it was unplugged.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.788 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to
turn around to tell

00:02:44.788 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
them there were no
popsicles, sadly--

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They thought
it was unplugged?

00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yeah--

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.557 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
didn't tell anybody or--

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: No, they
actually closed the--

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a game
that I was part of a game

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:90%
and it was going to end anytime.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But they closed the garage
door and they ran home,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.362 align:middle line:90%
or they went and played.

00:03:00.362 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can't open
those things from inside,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:90%
can you?

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Not in those days, no.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't get out.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:90%
And I tried.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I jiggled and
wiggled and tried,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:90%
and I was screaming a lot.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.560 align:middle line:84%
But you know, between
the fence into the house,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and it was separated, the garage
was separated from our house.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was this summertime?

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: It was--
no, thank goodness,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:90%
but it was spring, late spring.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.870 align:middle line:90%
So it was hot.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it was hot inside
because it was unplugged?

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yeah.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your
mother call the medics?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: No,
actually, she didn't.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She didn't
call the medics?

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: No, I'll explain that.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:84%
My father was-- my father
was a pretty hardcore guy,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and she was supposed to
bolt it down and turn it

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:90%
towards the wall.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.010 align:middle line:90%
And she hadn't done it.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:84%
No one was allowed
to play in there.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So she didn't want
to get blamed for this.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.142 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: She didn't
want to be blamed,

00:03:49.142 --> 00:03:50.603 align:middle line:90%
but I had a cracked open chin.

00:03:50.603 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So later on, my father
asked me, how did

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:90%
you get a crack in your chin?

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Because when my mom opened
up the freezer, she spun me.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And when she realized I was
ashen, and I wasn't breathing,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:84%
she screamed and dropped
me, is what she told me.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Went to go get a phone
because they didn't

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:90%
have cell phones in those days.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And I fell and I cracked open my
jaw, my chin, and I came back.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was the
dropping that got

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:90%
your breathing started again?

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Well, physically, yes.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
But I think the spirit world
is what put me back in my body.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's what we
come back to at this point.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
near-death experience,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:90%
you witnessed the other side.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember
the other side at that age?

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Everything.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was it like?

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Unconditional love.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:90%
It pulsates, the beauty.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Flowers pulsate.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:90%
They're so alive.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Colors are so alive and
so in touch with our soul.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- I don't know how--
there are no human words

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:84%
but everything is in touch with
your soul so you belong there.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And lights everywhere, and
music like you've never heard,

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:84%
flowers you've never seen,
colors you've never experienced.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like being in a cartoon
almost, but not a cartoon.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:90%
It's live.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's so beautiful
and so loving.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
angels, when they sing,

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:84%
the words in the music come out
at the same time and they're

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:90%
always singing.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're there for
the children immediately.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
in no rush to go back?

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: I wasn't in a rush.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think-- I don't think I
recognized where I was, really.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:90%
I was so little.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And you take you
with you, I would

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:84%
imagine there was a beautiful
stone and I saw faces in it.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to reach
into it and I couldn't.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And I imagine if I could have,
I wouldn't have come back.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that was
the pure other side.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.070 align:middle line:90%
That was it right there.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:84%
But it was like a giant
pyramid crystal stone.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was sheer,
so I guess crystal.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.520 align:middle line:84%
But it was beautiful but
I couldn't get into it.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was very curious
being a little girl.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think anybody would
be, even an adult, you know,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:90%
we'd want to know, what is that?

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it change
your life forever?

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Forever.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: When I came back,
I saw spirits everywhere.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.062 align:middle line:84%
They were in my bedroom,
at night especially,

00:06:25.062 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:84%
looking in my window in
the corner of the room,

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:90%
down the hallway.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:90%
I was terrified.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought they
were the boogeyman.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So I put the blankets over my
head and say, go away, go away.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.110 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad they didn't,
because as time went on,

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I started to understand
everything they taught me.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I understood none of
it when I was there.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:90%
They taught me so much.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And now being the age I am,
you know, as time went on,

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I learned what they meant.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And as things came in front
of me, like loss and things

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Susan, would you
recommend other people

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.970 align:middle line:84%
go through near-death
experiences

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.747 align:middle line:84%
or would you prefer
they stay away from it?

00:06:59.747 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, I would definitely
wouldn't recommend they do it

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:84%
purposely because I don't know
what their experience would be.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think that if they
go through it, it's a gift.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Definitely a gift.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:84%
It's so magnificent and it
changes you for the good.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:90%
You become a better person.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.435 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
know what person I

00:07:21.435 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
would have been without it
because I was so little.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:84%
But I work with
children and adults that

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:90%
have near-death experiences.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm a therapist and
I work with them,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and they tell me they're
changed completely from it.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:90%
It's just magnificent.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.217 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the other
side mean to you now?

00:07:38.217 --> 00:07:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: What does it mean to me?

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Beauty, grace,
unconditional love.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:84%
If I could-- we can't even
conceptualize that here.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
It's so magnificent,
that kind of feeling,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
where not only are we loved but
we love ourselves, which is--

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a hell?

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: I didn't see any.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, I believe
what you fear, you feed.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.820 align:middle line:90%
And what you feed, you perceive.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And what you perceive
becomes your reality.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So I don't fear it and I
don't entertain it at all.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I don't expect
a little girl at your age

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:90%
at that time to experience hell.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Exactly.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But do you
think it's there?

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: I didn't see it.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.543 align:middle line:90%
And no, I don't.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you're not sure?

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yeah.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:84%
My internal being
feels like it's not.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But there's a heaven?

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It's different than
what we call heaven.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a vibrational energy above
us, but it's right beside us

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere and it's in us.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.887 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But where do the bad
people go when they're gone?

00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: The bad people--

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
my hope is, is that they get
healed so that they don't

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:90%
come back and do it again.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I really believe--
it's kind of like we send them

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:90%
to a hospital here.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.053 align:middle line:84%
They go to a place
where they get healed.

00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people
say that when they're

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:84%
in their near-death
experience-- moment,

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:84%
their loved ones
who have passed on

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:84%
will visit them, comfort
them, be with them.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Did you experience that at all?

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: No, I did not.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see any
of my loved ones.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I felt them, but
I didn't see them.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I saw the angels.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.720 align:middle line:84%
The angels were all
around me, which

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:90%
is very common for children.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:84%
They have a different experience
because we don't understand,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and we feel safe with
something so pure and loving.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And I remember feeling people,
but I didn't have a lot of death

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:34.750 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know a lot of
people who had passed,

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:90%
in fact, probably no one.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I wouldn't have
related to who they were.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:84%
But I knew they knew me
and I knew they loved me.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you deal
with the spirit world

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:90%
most of the time now?

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: All of the time.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:90%
All of the time.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Like I have someone
here for you right now.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For me?

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who?

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Ian.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.875 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah, he just died.

00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:00.675 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: OK--

00:10:00.675 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was one of our talk
show hosts on Coast to Coast.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Very kind man.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Could be competitive.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I feel like he had something
with his organ and--

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had died
of liver disease.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Non-alcoholic.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Non-alcoholic,
yeah, he's not that person.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.542 align:middle line:90%
He's very good guy.

00:10:22.542 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
He's got a lot of
integrity in character.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was a
deacon in the church.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: There's the
integrity in character.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Very good man.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.950 align:middle line:90%
And he's happy.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:90%
He's gloriously happy.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:90%
And he's saying hello.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
He just wanted me
to tell you hello.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:84%
He feels very close
to all of you.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you why, and I
don't know who all of you are,

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
but he's telling me he feels
very close to all of you.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And he wants you to know
that he's safe and he's happy

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:90%
and he's not in pain.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's about 33 and he's
really, really liking it.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
he's 63 real life.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Yeah, he's
33 there, he says.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.100 align:middle line:90%
And he really likes it.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:90%
No aches, no pains, no problems.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:90%
So he just wanted to say hello.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Living is
for the living, Susan.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.790 align:middle line:90%
I've always believed that.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.517 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Yeah, I agree
with that very much.

00:11:09.517 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that a line
from Shawshank Redemption,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.730 align:middle line:84%
"get on living or get on
dying," or something like that.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:84%
What do you recommend
to people who

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:84%
are on the fence about
the other side, who

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:90%
might not believe it's real?

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Something will happen
in their lives that will

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:90%
help them understand it more.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
just limit our beliefs.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:84%
We have a brain,
so we have a soul

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
that's connected like a vine
to the spirit world, which

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.310 align:middle line:90%
is our healer mechanism.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get wounded,
it's not damaged.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we can go
inside ourselves and heal.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:84%
We can heal our brain,
our brokenness, our pain,

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
our suffering through that
soul source, which is spirit.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And when people go through
a lot of trauma and pain.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately for them,
they have that soul area

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:90%
that they can tap into to heal.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:84%
The more pain you go through,
the less your beliefs

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:90%
are limited.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So we-- you know, pain,
negative and positive,

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:90%
are equal in value.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Good and bad are equal in value.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.550 align:middle line:90%
They both teach us something.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I think the
negative teaches us more.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your near-death
experience awaken your abilities

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:90%
as a medium?

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Absolutely.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.755 align:middle line:84%
They were already there, but it
definitely brought it to light.

00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:90%
And they were everywhere.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.090 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't try to be a medium.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know what it was.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it was
James Van Praagh

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.947 align:middle line:90%
that I met first that told me--

00:12:32.947 --> 00:12:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One of the best--

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: He said, you've
had a near-death experience

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.530 align:middle line:84%
and they're
everywhere around you.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Just walked right up to me.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And from then on, I knew him
because he knew my story.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
what a medium was.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any connection
to that, really, until I was--

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet you know now.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: I know now.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:90%
I do therapy work.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.440 align:middle line:90%
I work with grief and addiction.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And to have mediumship come
in and be my main squeeze

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.650 align:middle line:90%
is really bizarre to me.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But people kept coming to
me because I knew things.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is grief
natural for people?

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Yes, we
grieve from the moment

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.980 align:middle line:84%
we're born as simple down to our
blankie our mother takes away,

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.580 align:middle line:84%
our bottle our
mother takes away.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
We are being prepared for the
major griefs, our whole journey.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So that our soul can
help us get through it.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we're not--
it's not something that

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:90%
just comes out of the blue.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
There's just different levels of
grief but we're always grieving.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we all
have guardian angels?

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes, we do.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.860 align:middle line:90%
We usually have 6 to 12.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what I saw.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:90%
I had three there.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.413 align:middle line:84%
But what I saw, meaning with
other people that I saw there,

00:13:43.413 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could see people,
I just didn't know them.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.205 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
know the difference

00:13:47.205 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:84%
between a loved one, a guardian
angel, whatever you have there?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Familiarity.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So a loved one is familiar,
you'll feel loved,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel-- your hair will
stand on and you'll smell them.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel them.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.225 align:middle line:90%
You'll want to touch.

00:14:00.225 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:90%
You'll want to get close.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Where a guide is more
stern, they're guiding you.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're more
teaching you things.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the angels
are just pure love.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what you feel from them.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:84%
There's no familiarity,
really, but your loved ones

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:90%
are familiar to you.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:17.160 align:middle line:90%
That's how--

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.868 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of
reminds me of the movie,

00:14:18.868 --> 00:14:21.010 align:middle line:84%
"It's a Wonderful Life"
with Jimmy Stewart.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Remember that one?

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes, I do remember it.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clarence's guardian
angel saved his life, basically.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yeah.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a clip of you
tuning into someone's daughter

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:90%
who passed.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: OK.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:90%
I have a little girl.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.105 align:middle line:90%
Tragic accident.

00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm almost here.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.690 align:middle line:90%
She's between 10 and 12.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:90%
I see a bike.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.613 align:middle line:90%
I see a car.

00:14:49.613 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.870 align:middle line:90%
I see a head injury.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I see you're going down a
hill and she's going very fast

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:90%
and not being able to stop.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:90%
You understand that information?

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I also see that she did
not die on the scene.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.250 align:middle line:90%
You understand that information.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.490 align:middle line:84%
She said she heard
everything you said to her.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And even though she
was in a hospital

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and she wasn't coming
back to talk to you,

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.270 align:middle line:84%
she heard every loving
word you ever said to her.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:84%
All the i-love-yous,
all the kisses

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:84%
from the family,
all the adoration.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I see someone rubbing
her toes and making

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:90%
sure her feet are warm.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, her
feet had significance.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:90%
I see kisses.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.060 align:middle line:10%
I see a lot of fluff.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:10%
Who is Molly?

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:39.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Our daughter.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAU: That's her name?

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:10%
OK, thank you.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:10%
I want you to know that Molly
is always with you, always.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.660 align:middle line:10%
And she says thank
you for loving me.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for
being there for me.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:10%
What kind of bracelet--

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:10%
honor?

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:10%
She knows, she has the bracelet.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:10%
She wants you to
know she knows that.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:10%
You also light a candle for her.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.390 align:middle line:10%
Yes?

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.110 align:middle line:10%
Yes, we did.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.910 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAU: All right.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:10%
She sees the candle.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.090 align:middle line:10%
Wizard of Oz keeps coming
to me for some reason.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what that means.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:10%
Do you understand that?

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.850 align:middle line:10%
>> She loved
theater and singing,

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:10%
and she would sing
Somewhere Over the Rainbow.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.950 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAU: I also see a
grandmother on the other side.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:10%
Do you understand
this information?

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.330 align:middle line:10%
And grandma is also
there with her,

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:10%
giving her lots
and lots of love.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:10%
>> My grandmother is
passed, so she raised me.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Could be her-- also John's
grandmother is also named Molly.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.785 align:middle line:90%
She's passed as well.

00:16:37.785 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>> For my grandmother.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:90%
For my--

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: I think she's
with your grandma.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: She's with her both.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Families want to stay
together on the other side.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's left behind.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:90%
She wanted to be an actress.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.400 align:middle line:90%
That was her dream.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:10%
And she says so
she's doing it there.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.400 align:middle line:90%
She wants you to know that.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.270 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand that the
song, you are my sunshine,

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.970 align:middle line:90%
my only sunshine?

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: It has great
significance, doesn't it?

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Because she's singing
up to you now.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but she sang
it to mine, too.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.849 align:middle line:90%
She loves you very much.

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:21.170 align:middle line:84%
But what she's telling
me is that she likes to--

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and not seeing monarchs,
which is interesting.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.886 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually seeing
white and yellow.

00:17:25.886 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Yellow is her favorite color.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yeah.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.376 align:middle line:90%
So that's for you.

00:17:31.376 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of emotion
in that room, Susan.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Very much so.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:90%
It's emotional watching it.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you,
I haven't watched it.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're getting
misty-eyed already.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yeah.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was broken up and
I noticed people in the audience

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
with the tissues and
things like that.

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: It's a beautiful way to
connect people to their grief

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:55.970 align:middle line:90%
and help them heal.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Most people come to
me and they'll say,

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I've been in
therapy for six years,

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.430 align:middle line:90%
just in this one hour.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just mediumship
is a vine to the soul,

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and the soul is helping
you with your grief,

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and spirit comes
in and does that.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But when they're saying they
understand, I'm thinking--

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't usually
share this, but I'm

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:90%
thinking, how did I know that?

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So they'll go, how
did you know that?

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.592 align:middle line:84%
And they'll cover their mouths
and I go, how did I know that?

00:18:21.592 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:90%
It seems impossible, but I do.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.320 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know how.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.607 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
have a guide who's

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:29.720 align:middle line:90%
talking to you in your head?

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: I have
guides, but mediumship

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:84%
feels like it drops
into the top of my head

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and goes through my body
and it's just a knowing.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:90%
And I use all the clair-senses.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.370 align:middle line:90%
They're all there.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.288 align:middle line:84%
So I smell, taste,
touch, hear, see.

00:18:45.288 --> 00:18:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have it all?

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can anybody receive
messages from the other side?

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Absolutely.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.570 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
But when you limit your
beliefs, the answer is no.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So you have to get rid
of your limiting beliefs

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and you have to do kind
of a stepping process.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I teach people how to
do that by, I call it the three

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:90%
A's.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which are?

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Awareness,
Acceptance, and Action.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:84%
You become aware
that they're there.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Your hair stands on end.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
You have these responses,
physical or emotional.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And they become aware
that you're aware.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you accept
they're there

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and they realize that
you're accepting it.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.970 align:middle line:90%
And then the action is trust.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:90%
You trust they're there.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that, you've
removed your limiting beliefs

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:90%
and they step in to help you.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're so
excited that you're

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.313 align:middle line:84%
listening that they're going to
give you all the messages they

00:19:34.313 --> 00:19:35.113 align:middle line:90%
possibly can.

00:19:35.113 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, as
a medium, you've

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.560 align:middle line:84%
had profound experiences
transmitting messages

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.100 align:middle line:90%
from the other side.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a look at another
one of these readings

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:90%
that you've done.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: I feel like
they're both around.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.157 align:middle line:90%
Your mother is with your father.

00:19:48.157 --> 00:19:49.490 align:middle line:90%
You understand that information?

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.823 align:middle line:84%
And your father wants you to
know how much he loves you.

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:90%
And he's sorry for everything.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:84%
He's been sorry since
he's left, and he

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:84%
wishes he would have said more
to you when you went to see him.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:84%
He wishes he would have
been able to say more,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:90%
is what he's saying right now.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I wish I would have
been able to say more.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what was
wrong that he couldn't.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.210 align:middle line:10%
Just a little, not too much.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:10%
OK, thank you.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me that
he was speaking.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.990 align:middle line:84%
In his mind, he was trying
to give you information

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:90%
that he was weak at that point.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I see him crossing over and
trying to give you messages

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.465 align:middle line:84%
and then coming
back into his body.

00:20:25.465 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to
know that he was

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:90%
trying to make amends to you.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me to tell you
that he knows your soul.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.473 align:middle line:84%
Your mother was your best
friend, much more so than her--

00:20:33.473 --> 00:20:35.140 align:middle line:84%
this was the love of
your mother's life.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RAYMOND GONZALES: Yeah.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.618 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Your mother
couldn't get enough of him.

00:20:37.618 --> 00:20:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And so to have to leave
him was a protection.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's not your
fault. It's his.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Her protecting you was
about him, not you.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.395 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
always remember that.

00:20:50.395 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Your father wants
you to know that he's

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:84%
trying very hard to clean up
whatever he caused, the pain

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:90%
that he caused you.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
He wants to clean
it up, and he wants

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:84%
you to know that you're
very important to him.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.573 align:middle line:10%
>>GONZALES: The
one part that was

00:21:03.573 --> 00:21:05.740 align:middle line:10%
Susan that really got me
is when she started talking

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:10%
about my dad, because it was
just like a relationship that

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.880 align:middle line:10%
was never good.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:17.170 align:middle line:10%
And when she went there, she
opened up a whole like a chapter

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.830 align:middle line:10%
that I'd always
just try to forget.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And just everything came
back to the surface.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think, in ways,
it was healing for me

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:84%
because it was something
I've held on to

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:90%
for quite some time in my life.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I struggled as a man and just
because of how I was treated.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when she told me
the things she told me,

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.035 align:middle line:90%
it really like--

00:21:41.035 --> 00:21:44.030 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:49.250 align:middle line:84%
it fills me and it made me feel
better about myself as a man

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.305 align:middle line:84%
and doing what I'm doing
in my life, that I am--

00:21:52.305 --> 00:21:56.600 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:90%
today I'm worth it.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:10%
And I'm just like, I'm not
where he said I was, so--

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm an emotional bear.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It gets emotional
even for tough guys like him.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yeah.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a healing mechanism.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you miss someone
and all of a sudden

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
you're hearing things
that make sense to you,

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that
mediumship is evidential.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.890 align:middle line:90%
You need to have evidence.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
hear that evidence,

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.186 align:middle line:90%
you feel the energy of them.

00:22:31.186 --> 00:22:33.720 align:middle line:84%
You start to feel
it with the medium.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And so there's so much healing
when they can say they're sorry

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:90%
or fix something.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it like
to help other people?

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Amazing, but
it's also very painful.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For both of you?

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: I try not to take
on other people's pain

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.600 align:middle line:90%
because that wouldn't be OK.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, especially
when it's children,

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I've had an experience
with a child

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:84%
recently that I literally
sat out in my outer office

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:90%
and sobbed, just sobbed.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:84%
It's so overwhelming
when a child is injured.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you keep
doing what you're doing?

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Because
I'm called to it.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:90%
I can't stop.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.680 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of me.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.810 align:middle line:84%
It's part it's-- it's
not an extension of me.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:90%
It's part of who I am.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It gets emotional,
though, doesn't it?

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAU: It does,
but it also feels

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.268 align:middle line:10%
wonderful to help
someone heal something

00:23:24.268 --> 00:23:26.310 align:middle line:10%
that they've been holding
on to their whole lives

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.280 align:middle line:10%
and they have no mechanism
or way in their minds

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.670 align:middle line:10%
to connect with that person and
get the freedom of I'm sorry

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:10%
and I love you, and
I've always loved you.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't you.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:90%
It was me.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, those are healing words.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you get and
make people feel comfortable

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:90%
with your mediumship?

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:90%
By giving them closure?

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing for them
that gives them that ability

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.920 align:middle line:90%
not to grieve as much?

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: I believe it's closure.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I think that, you know, it
won't change the grief process

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:84%
because grief decides
when it's done with you.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't decide when
you're done with it.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't
change the process.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:11.190 align:middle line:84%
But what it does do is give you
a sense of peace in your grief,

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.830 align:middle line:84%
of knowing that your
loved one is still there

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and around you and
they're not gone forever

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.573 align:middle line:90%
and you will see them again.

00:24:17.573 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
common messages

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that spirits convey to
you about the other side?

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Yes, that they love
us, that everything will be OK.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.420 align:middle line:84%
When I was crying
over a child one time,

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in a room and
an orb shaped like a heart--

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I actually was filming and an
orb just came in front of me

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.555 align:middle line:90%
like a heart and dropped down.

00:24:38.555 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I kept saying, I
love all of you,

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:90%
but I can't do this anymore.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that orb
and I have it on film

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and it just went right in
front of me and dropped.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And they were telling
me they loved me.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.520 align:middle line:90%
And it changed everything.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to go back
and keep doing my job.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Susan, you seem
very positive and upbeat.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:90%
What does negativity do?

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily from
you, but from others

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.590 align:middle line:90%
to this whole scheme.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Well, I wasn't--

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.747 align:middle line:84%
I have two brothers and a
mother that committed suicide.

00:25:09.747 --> 00:25:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sorry to hear that.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, it made
me a better person and--

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Two brothers
and a mother?

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.720 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: And in fact, tomorrow
is the death date of my mom.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.660 align:middle line:90%
And I don't grieve like I did.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And they don't talk
to me that much

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.710 align:middle line:90%
because I'm too close to it.

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:84%
But I think that when you
go into the negative space,

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.060 align:middle line:90%
you go into that fear base.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And that fear base stops you
from being able to communicate.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So I've spent my life
looking at things in a way

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that I know they're safe, I know
they're there in a good place,

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I know that they're
not suffering anymore.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, people who
commit suicide are suffering.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:52.135 align:middle line:90%
I don't encourage it.

00:25:52.135 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're tormented.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Yes, I certainly
don't encourage it.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:90%
But they're not punished there.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can I ask what your
mother was so depressed about?

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: My mother-- my mother
lost two sons and my father

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:90%
died from pancreatic cancer.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And my sister-in-law
died from a brain tumor.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So she was
in massive grieving.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Yes, and she just
couldn't get through it.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.370 align:middle line:90%
And she tried.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she held on
for about 15 years.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, you
know, she got ill.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.520 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't feeling well.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:90%
And she just gave up.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:84%
She lived for four days
and I worked hospice.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So I got to help her cross,
which is such a gift for someone

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:31.810 align:middle line:90%
to give you.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you know
she was going to cross?

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Absolutely.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:90%
She was not cognizant.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:37.810 align:middle line:90%
She didn't come back.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes you
unexpectedly tune in the spirits

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:84%
of loved ones who
aren't anticipating it.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at that example.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, let's see if
you can pick up any energies

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:50.970 align:middle line:90%
in the room.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, I pick up a
lot of energies in the room.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to move towards
your cameraman again.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
I really feel compelled
to keep talking

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to you about your
friend, cousin, brother.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.210 align:middle line:90%
He's pretty cool.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.720 align:middle line:90%
He was fun when he was young.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.070 align:middle line:90%
He was active, he was outgoing.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loved him.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.410 align:middle line:90%
He had a great personality.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:12.670 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:10%
And it just feels
like he wants to--

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.780 align:middle line:10%
I see him playing music,
not just listening to music.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So I do want to say
that it seems to be he

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.000 align:middle line:84%
wanted to play it or be
around it all the time.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.753 align:middle line:10%
So he either played
instruments or was

00:27:24.753 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:10%
with people who
played instruments

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.920 align:middle line:10%
on a continuous basis
because I'm not just

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.090 align:middle line:10%
saying listening to music.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.210 align:middle line:10%
That makes sense to you?

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.440 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKO ALLYN QUINONES: Yeah.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.820 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAU: OK.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.580 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me you
were his brother.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:90%
He loves you with all his heart.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.050 align:middle line:84%
He wants you to know that
this was an accident.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So he's showing me that he
had an up and down mood.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.430 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, he may have
said I should just die,

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:90%
everybody would be happy.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But this was not
that particular time.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.715 align:middle line:84%
He wants to make that
very clear to you.

00:27:53.715 --> 00:27:55.090 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't want
you to ever think

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
he'd leave without
talking to you properly.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:03.910 align:middle line:10%
>>QUINONES: As soon as
Susan walked into the room,

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:07.720 align:middle line:10%
I immediately felt her
gravitating towards me.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.880 align:middle line:10%
I even told the
assistant that I feel

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.150 align:middle line:10%
like she's going
to read me or just

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.900 align:middle line:10%
something along those lines.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was kind of nervous.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And when she started
talking about my cousin,

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:90%
I was at a loss for words.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.490 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:35.270 align:middle line:84%
She said things that no one
else would know but me and him.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:41.595 align:middle line:84%
And it made me feel
quite good inside.

00:28:41.595 --> 00:28:44.920 align:middle line:90%


00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I've had so many questions
that are unanswered

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, now that
she said what she did,

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:03.055 align:middle line:90%
I feel, I feel a lot better.

00:29:03.055 --> 00:29:06.300 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, you
help a lot of people.

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.925 align:middle line:84%
Can you turn your mediumship
on and off like a switch?

00:29:10.925 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Actually, James
taught me to do that.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.440 align:middle line:90%
So I use a dial in my head.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And so when I don't
need it, I turn it down.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.942 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes I'll be out to
eat and it just takes over.

00:29:19.942 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll see someone across
the room and I'll

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
hear the mother behind her
saying, tell her I'm here.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Tell her I'm here.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.542 align:middle line:84%
It would be completely
inappropriate just being,

00:29:27.542 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:84%
you know, a grief
counselor, I just

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.180 align:middle line:90%
know better than to do that.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.830 align:middle line:90%
But I do hear them.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Or I'll look across the
room and see someone and go,

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.920 align:middle line:84%
oh their grandfather's with them
or their father or their child.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.530 align:middle line:90%
It just kind of comes on.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:84%
But I can then turn it down
so that I can eat and enjoy

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:45.740 align:middle line:90%
my company.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: It is.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.440 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating to me.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you,
when I do it, when

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I see these things, because
I don't watch these,

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and when I see them, I'm
going, wow, I said that?

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.380 align:middle line:90%
How did I know that?

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you know that?

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.470 align:middle line:84%
How do you know that it's not
a figment of your imagination,

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:04.590 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, because
I just trust it.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when I say it and
it makes sense to them,

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:90%
then I know it's evidential.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:84%
It's evidence that
they're talking

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:84%
because it's not just random
stuff that makes no sense.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They know, don't they?

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes, they do.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In what ways can
mediumship facilitate healing

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.350 align:middle line:90%
after a loss?

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, you just
saw it on the screen.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that people
have this pain and mediumship

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.580 align:middle line:84%
steps in and loved ones
are there talking to them

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.050 align:middle line:90%
and healing them.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People come to
you, Susan, for clarity.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.020 align:middle line:90%
They come to you for closure.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.980 align:middle line:84%
They want to receive
help with healing

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.350 align:middle line:90%
and have you fix their grief.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at how you connected
to the daughter of someone who

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.786 align:middle line:90%
was in your audience.

00:30:51.786 --> 00:30:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: I have an
overdosed child.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:90%
She feels like-- shifted into--

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:84%
this feels like
fentanyl and heroin,

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:90%
or fentanyl and like OxyContin.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.592 align:middle line:84%
She connected to a J-name,
maybe Jessica or Jonathan

00:31:13.592 --> 00:31:14.550 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a connection
there for her.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.967 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has her ring.

00:31:17.967 --> 00:31:19.175 align:middle line:90%
There's a ring on her finger.

00:31:19.175 --> 00:31:24.190 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>> It's here.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.500 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAU: So this was a
little, sweet little kid.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:32.360 align:middle line:10%
Very, very outgoing and
very, very much had her--

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.220 align:middle line:10%
what things should look like.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.330 align:middle line:10%
And always everything was
a little bit difficult.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:10%
But she was a sweet little kid.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:10%
And she's a sweetie pie.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.240 align:middle line:10%
And she got into drugs.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.850 align:middle line:10%
And it was a battle from
the moment she got into.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:46.080 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't a short-term thing.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.930 align:middle line:10%
It was a long-term thing.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:48.762 align:middle line:10%
I'm the kind of--

00:31:48.762 --> 00:31:50.220 align:middle line:10%
how long do you
know she was using.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.840 align:middle line:10%
But I see her as a young age,
starting with the early teens.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:10%
And she's saying that
she lied and manipulated,

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.350 align:middle line:10%
and she's saying more and more.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm so sorry what
I put you through.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.460 align:middle line:10%
She actually has a
beautiful energy.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.580 align:middle line:10%
She truly does.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:09.700 align:middle line:10%
I think-- she's funny,
loved music, loved life.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.810 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.430 align:middle line:90%
--for other reasons.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, addiction,
really, she had the disease.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It runs in your family
and she caught it.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:84%
She says that you are suffering
deeply from the loss of her

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and you just want
your baby girl back.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.230 align:middle line:10%
And she said, I'm not going.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:10%
Who took her sweatshirt?

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I did.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.430 align:middle line:10%
OK, when you wear it,
she's going to hop in.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.900 align:middle line:90%


00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.660 align:middle line:10%
But also-- whatever
it is you're kissing?

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.310 align:middle line:10%
You understand this?

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.240 align:middle line:10%
She's seeing you.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.460 align:middle line:10%
She said, OK, fine.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm giving you a kiss back.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.430 align:middle line:10%
And she wants you to always
remember she's doing that.

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:10%
So wherever you are, whatever
this is, this picture,

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.410 align:middle line:10%
what is it?

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:01.040 align:middle line:10%
>> That's on a
rose quartz hearth.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.480 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAU: I love it.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:10%
All right, so she's
seeing you, just then.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.870 align:middle line:10%
And she wants you to know
she's never going to not see.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.270 align:middle line:10%
Why is she saying
the word "praise"?

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:16.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I was actually singing a
song with that word today.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:20.210 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:23.080 align:middle line:10%
The lyric was shining
your grace upon me.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.087 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAU: She heard you.

00:33:25.087 --> 00:33:27.420 align:middle line:10%
That's what she's telling me
to tell you, she heard you.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.076 align:middle line:90%


00:33:30.076 --> 00:33:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: She's like
she's suffered.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry for your loss.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Susan, can you connect
with any spirit you want.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.335 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: No, they decide.

00:33:42.335 --> 00:33:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They decide.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.925 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: They decide.

00:33:44.925 --> 00:33:47.610 align:middle line:84%
What I do is I ask them
to suit up and show up.

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:49.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what I ask them to do.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:51.483 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be somewhere
and I'll say,

00:33:51.483 --> 00:33:52.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to
be reading today.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I need you to suit up
and show up for me.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And then it just starts
dropping into my head.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that they come
down in their vibration

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and I go up in
mine, so that helps.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.390 align:middle line:84%
But I can't go up
nearly as high as they

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:09.239 align:middle line:84%
are so they're coming down
a lot lower than I am.

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you say
to skeptics, non-believers?

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: It's OK.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.449 align:middle line:90%
They don't need to.

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:18.870 align:middle line:84%
It will come to them if it's
meant to in this life journey.

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that we put
a lot of pressure

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.810 align:middle line:84%
on people to just believe
instead of just allowing

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:26.239 align:middle line:90%
them to do their journey.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Some people just aren't
meant to be in that space

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.489 align:middle line:90%
during this time.

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But usually when
something happens,

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.889 align:middle line:90%
it's when they come see me.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:35.230 align:middle line:90%
They lose someone they love.

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take us
through the process

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:39.679 align:middle line:84%
that it takes you to
connect with a spirit.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:41.949 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: I look at the
person and I ask spirit

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:50.920 align:middle line:84%
to tell me something, anything
if they're coming to me.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And stuff just starts
dropping into me

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and it just feels like
a vine of information.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Like Ian's telling me, he
flashes things on and off

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and he's a little
bit of a jokester,

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.090 align:middle line:84%
so I think you
better be prepared

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.230 align:middle line:84%
because he's going to be
turning things on and off.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And it might be at
important times.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh great.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: I know.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He is a jokester.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: He knows Tom also.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:17.220 align:middle line:90%
He feels very attached to Tom.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.550 align:middle line:90%
So I do want to say that.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying he's
joking around with him

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and he needs him
to pay attention.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He knows Tom and
Tom talked to him a week

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:90%
before he died.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Did not think he
was going to die.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, sometimes we
don't, you know, and it happens.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:36.880 align:middle line:90%
But he's not dead.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.600 align:middle line:90%
Those are human terms.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:90%
He's more than alive.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're more alive
there than you ever are here.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.380 align:middle line:84%
This is-- this seems
like the dream.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:50.450 align:middle line:84%
This seems like the distance
that we here think it is there.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:54.365 align:middle line:84%
When you're there,
this is the dream.

00:35:54.365 --> 00:35:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about your
book, Infinite Life, Infinite

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Lessons.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: It's amazing.

00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Spirit helped me write it.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.512 align:middle line:84%
I heard one day you
need to write a book.

00:36:01.512 --> 00:36:02.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm not a writer.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And I heard, you
need to write a book.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.810 align:middle line:84%
You need to stop everything
and write a book.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just sat down and
it came and just flowed.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.730 align:middle line:84%
It's all about exercises
and integrations.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is it.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Oh, yeah.

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:15.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm so proud of it.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:10%
And it helps people
understand the spirit world.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:10%
It helps them with dying.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:22.730 align:middle line:10%
It helps them with
different kinds of death.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Like if they have
suicide in their life

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.460 align:middle line:84%
or any of those kinds
of losses, murders.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:84%
It helps people
tap into exercises

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.160 align:middle line:90%
to get closer to spirit.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.150 align:middle line:84%
It has so much to
offer, and it also

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.650 align:middle line:84%
tells my story of
what happened to me.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are two ancient
writings, the Egyptian Book

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.820 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead and the Tibetan
Book of the Dead, which

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.730 align:middle line:84%
are training guides for
people, teaching them

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.040 align:middle line:84%
what's the other
side is like, what

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.240 align:middle line:90%
you can expect when you die.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Is that a little bit
of what yours is?

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Absolutely.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:59.150 align:middle line:84%
There's so much clarity in it,
and it's easy to understand.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the spirit kind of
push you into writing this book?

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: 100%.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't consider
myself a writer.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing a second book now
that goes along with this book,

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:13.010 align:middle line:84%
too, because we have
infinite lessons to learn.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:16.700 align:middle line:90%
And so more is coming.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's a really good book.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We had-- a
well-known singer just passed,

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Steve Lawrence.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:28.550 align:middle line:84%
His wife, Eydie
Gormé, died in 2013.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is ironic because
a week before he died,

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:39.990 align:middle line:84%
he was in his '80s, I was online
trying to find out where he was

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:42.970 align:middle line:90%
to get him on my radio show.

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't find
him at that point.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.750 align:middle line:90%
And then he dies a week later.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:50.170 align:middle line:84%
What are the odds
of that happening?

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, it came into
your head for a reason.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:54.740 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.010 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world just
makes things happen

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.940 align:middle line:90%
and they get-- we have notice.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.110 align:middle line:90%
We're told things.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:01.690 align:middle line:90%
We're just not listening.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.920 align:middle line:90%
We are busy.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're doing life
and we're not listening

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.000 align:middle line:90%
to what they're saying to us.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And they really do want
us to pause and listen.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And if we stay where
our feet are, literally

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.960 align:middle line:84%
like in this present
moment, if we're present,

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.660 align:middle line:84%
we're able to hear them
and experience them much

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.410 align:middle line:90%
stronger than when we're not.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And we, on this
planet, walk around

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.160 align:middle line:90%
not present a lot of the time.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.730 align:middle line:84%
We're working, we're
rushing, we're talking,

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.310 align:middle line:90%
we're, you know, we're busy.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And so being present
really helps.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.302 align:middle line:84%
But the odds are very strong
if you're connected to someone

00:38:35.302 --> 00:38:37.510 align:middle line:84%
or you're looking for someone
that they could pop in,

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:84%
you just happen to pause
and hear the information.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.480 align:middle line:90%
His name--

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I picked it up.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.940 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
common misperceptions

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:90%
about life and death?

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: That we are
punished over there

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.338 align:middle line:84%
or that we know-- we have
sins that we have to pay for,

00:38:55.338 --> 00:38:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're not going to
see our loved ones, which

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.630 align:middle line:84%
is the furthest
thing from the truth.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:00.890 align:middle line:90%
You see them immediately.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And in hospice, I watch them
see them before they died.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.720 align:middle line:90%
They were there talking to them.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.990 align:middle line:90%
We are with them.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And that they love us
unconditionally no matter what.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And that your soul
can never be damaged.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.380 align:middle line:84%
That's a really important
thing, is to recognize that.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't get wounds.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Our spirit does, and spirit
is the breath of life.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So our spirit, our
heart, our brain, yes,

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:84%
gets damaged, but
our soul never.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:84%
It is the only thing we have to
be able to go inward to heal.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:84%
We have to have something in
there or we would never heal.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul is there
for us through spirit.

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.110 align:middle line:90%
It always is and always will be.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your book explores
the concept of in-between.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:43.940 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: It's what
we're doing right now.

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.870 align:middle line:90%
We're not dying in this moment.

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:50.630 align:middle line:84%
We're not having
the actual crossover

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.410 align:middle line:90%
and we're not being birthed.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.230 align:middle line:90%
The in-between is life.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:55.638 align:middle line:90%
Life on life's terms.

00:39:55.638 --> 00:39:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it good
to be in-between?

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Absolutely.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.330 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:02.810 align:middle line:84%
There's an in-between too,
in between coming back here

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.320 align:middle line:90%
because I was in-between.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.610 align:middle line:90%
I was in that realm.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:07.170 align:middle line:90%
And I felt it and saw it.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And they spoke to me and told
me I'd be returning to my body.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.730 align:middle line:90%
And that was in-between also.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's two
separate in-betweens

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.090 align:middle line:90%
and the book talks about that.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.560 align:middle line:90%
It's like a two-sided mirror.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yeah.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
in reincarnation, Susan?

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: I do.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it's ego
to think that we

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.750 align:middle line:90%
can do it all in one lifetime.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.130 align:middle line:90%
There's so much to learn.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we get better
perceptively each time

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:29.930 align:middle line:90%
we come back?

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: I believe we do.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:33.347 align:middle line:84%
And what's wonderful about
that is that we don't remember.

00:40:33.347 --> 00:40:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And we don't remember
for a reason.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.130 align:middle line:84%
If I remember it, it
would change my journey.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I would make different decisions
that my free will wouldn't

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.090 align:middle line:90%
be involved with.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:43.770 align:middle line:84%
It would be, oh I
knew that there,

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:45.530 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not going to do that,
this and that, and this

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:46.330 align:middle line:90%
and that.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Instead of allowing myself
to evolve and grow and expand

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.420 align:middle line:90%
in my energy.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:90%
We're here for soul expansion.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's so important for us.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes if you died
in a past life of, let's say,

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:03.320 align:middle line:84%
a drowning, you're afraid
of water in this life.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.940 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, I think
it's more a memory,

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:10.530 align:middle line:90%
an imprint that happens to us.

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:13.380 align:middle line:90%
And our heart also goes with us.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Our brain does not.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Our heart carries
the memories we need.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that when we
come back, we have that heart.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they block out
what we don't-- what we're not

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.620 align:middle line:90%
supposed to on our next round.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.930 align:middle line:84%
But I think that has
something to do with it.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:29.730 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I never knew my
grandfather on my father's side.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.490 align:middle line:90%
He died before I was born.

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.830 align:middle line:90%
He died at about 50.

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But I remember my father as
he got close to that age just

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.380 align:middle line:84%
seemed to panic, you know,
because I think he really

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.340 align:middle line:84%
thought he was
going to go at 50.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:51.350 align:middle line:84%
He ended up going
until he was 88.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at the
lifestyle of your parents,

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.960 align:middle line:84%
do you sometimes feel
this could happen to me?

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Absolutely.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I remember when my father
got pancreatic cancer

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and when he died, I went
to the doctor three times.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Every time I got an ache or a
pain, I thought, I must have it.

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that's our
human condition.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:14.980 align:middle line:90%
We have fear.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.050 align:middle line:90%
And again, like I said--

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:18.383 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you still think
about pancreatic cancer even

00:42:18.383 --> 00:42:19.230 align:middle line:90%
to this day?

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: No, I don't now.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:20.705 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not anymore.

00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: But what
we fear, we feed.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.460 align:middle line:90%
I allow myself to feel it.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, no
more fear right now.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Not today, Susan.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.037 align:middle line:90%
You don't have it now.

00:42:29.037 --> 00:42:30.412 align:middle line:84%
And if you do,
you don't know it.

00:42:30.412 --> 00:42:31.360 align:middle line:90%
So not today.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.680 align:middle line:90%
That's what I tell myself.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.525 align:middle line:84%
And that brings me
back to the now.

00:42:34.525 --> 00:42:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eat almonds.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce said they
would help fight cancer.

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Wow.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.330 align:middle line:90%
I do eat them.

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:41.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's good.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Two a day, he said, minimum.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: That's good to know.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So what's next for you?

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: My second
book, which is actually

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.590 align:middle line:90%
called the Two-Sided Mirror.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:56.080 align:middle line:84%
We aren't just souls
having a human experience.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.340 align:middle line:84%
We are humans having
a soul experience.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's the two sides.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, the medium
James Van Praagh quite well.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: I do.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's one of the best.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:06.188 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: He's one
of my faves, yeah.

00:43:06.188 --> 00:43:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's very sensitive
and he's had an incredible life.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: He has.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I just had dinner with him four
nights ago, five nights ago.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
James order for dinner?

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, he
got the cookies.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:20.777 align:middle line:90%
I definitely he got the cookies.

00:43:20.777 --> 00:43:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He loves cookies.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:23.132 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes, chocolate chip.

00:43:23.132 --> 00:43:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he was a consultant
and ghost whisperer, I remember,

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.300 align:middle line:90%
wasn't he?

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes, he was.

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long time ago.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: He was.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:29.840 align:middle line:90%
He's a wonderful man.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.830 align:middle line:90%
He's very kind.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:32.150 align:middle line:90%
He's very helpful.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.860 align:middle line:90%
He's on your side.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.540 align:middle line:90%
And I love that.

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what I try to be, I
aspire to be that for people.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Expert in
reincarnation as well.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes, he is.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you tell
someone who's afraid of dying?

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, I think that that
is a normal human condition,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.210 align:middle line:90%
to be afraid.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to die.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
leave my loved ones.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not afraid of being
on the other side.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of how I'll die.

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no rush
to get to the other side.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But you do think
about it as you age.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Yeah, I'm 65
in a couple of months.

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, I do
think about it as--

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm 110.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.485 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: Well, you look
pretty good for 110.

00:44:13.485 --> 00:44:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Actually, my
mother is going to be 95

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and she's driving herself
and stuff like that.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.770 align:middle line:90%
She just keeps going.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yeah.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She just keeps going.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's normal and
natural to think

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.660 align:middle line:90%
about the other side, isn't it?

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: It is.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's normal to fear
how you're going to die.

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:34.553 align:middle line:84%
But if you think of it this
way, if there is no other side,

00:44:34.553 --> 00:44:36.970 align:middle line:84%
you won't know the difference
because there'll be nothing.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.200 align:middle line:90%
So you won't know.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So it might be behoove us to
think about the other side

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and think, wow, that
really could be.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.250 align:middle line:90%
And wouldn't that be exciting?

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.090 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't harm us.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you do fear death,
usually our humanness

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.420 align:middle line:84%
fears how we're
going to die, not

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.840 align:middle line:90%
being on the other side or not.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing
to fear if it isn't there.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we get to pick
our reincarnated next life?

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Yes.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a room called
the room of knowledge.

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:07.192 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people call
it the Akashic--

00:45:07.192 --> 00:45:07.992 align:middle line:90%
I don't even--

00:45:07.992 --> 00:45:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Akashic Records.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Thank you.

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't even-- it's
so out of my box

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.360 align:middle line:84%
because they taught me it
was the room of knowledge.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.040 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I call it.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.490 align:middle line:10%
And in there, I saw them
making choices and decisions.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And I actually saw them
discouraging some of it,

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.990 align:middle line:84%
like you don't want to
go through all that.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:27.170 align:middle line:90%
And we have free will.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I heard them
say, yes, I do.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.270 align:middle line:90%
I can handle it.

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.770 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, free will
is involved in everything.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:35.608 align:middle line:90%
Everything is not planned.

00:45:35.608 --> 00:45:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is so true.

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.860 align:middle line:84%
How do people get a
hold of you, Susan?

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAU: They can go
to ssusangrau.com.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.730 align:middle line:10%
They can go to social
media, Susan Grau Official.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:48.290 align:middle line:10%
They can call my lines.

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:50.140 align:middle line:84%
They go online and
just type in Susan Grau

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.832 align:middle line:90%
and they'll see it populate.

00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on the program.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAU: Thanks for having me.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.043 align:middle line:90%
I had a really good time.

00:45:55.043 --> 00:45:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Me too.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.410 align:middle line:84%
There was a time, I'll
be honest with you,

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I doubted the existence
of the other side.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend of mine who
died in a motorcycle accident

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.080 align:middle line:90%
and I went to his funeral.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
the body, and it just

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.210 align:middle line:90%
dawned on me that it was over.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:15.680 align:middle line:90%
It was done for him.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:19.990 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a sudden, I had
this stark feeling of loneliness

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:22.900 align:middle line:90%
that wore off instantly.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And I felt happy again because
I know he lives forever.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
