>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.770 align:middle line:10%
Mitch Horowitz with
us on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.300 align:middle line:10%
He is a well-known
author, and he's

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:10%
going to be talking with
us about some of his works

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:10%
and the esoteric principles
that have guided America.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:10%
Mitch, welcome to the program.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ: Thank
you so much, George.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.715 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many books
do you have out now?

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.553 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Gosh, at this
point, probably about a dozen.

00:00:43.553 --> 00:00:45.503 align:middle line:10%
I started with my
book, "Occult America."

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:46.670 align:middle line:10%
And I keep turning them out.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:10%
It's great--

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.068 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And the last one is?

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: The most recent one
is called "The Miracle Club."

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:10%
That's a book on the practical
benefits of mind metaphysics.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.328 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes
you so prolific?

00:00:55.328 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It's passion.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:90%
It really is passion.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:10%
I am so driven by
my subject matter

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:10%
that I just find, as I
discovered at one point

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:10%
in my life, I want to write
more than I want to sleep.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you
so interested in writing

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.772 align:middle line:84%
about America and the
principles behind it?

00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It started
when I was a little kid.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.460 align:middle line:10%
I was growing up in the borough
of Queens in New York City,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:10%
and I was interested in
astrology, and folklore,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:10%
and superstition.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:10%
And I wondered where all
this material came from

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:10%
and why it reached so many
people in American life.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
research it, and I

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:84%
found that occult and
esoteric principles are really

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:84%
in the groundwater
of our country.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.268 align:middle line:90%
It's part of who we are.

00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Including
Freemasonry for example.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh,
for real, for real.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:10%
Some of the founders
were Freemasons--

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:10%
George Washington, Benjamin
Franklin, Paul Revere,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.410 align:middle line:10%
John Hancock.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:10%
The list goes on and on.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
Freemasons anyways?

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I always thought they
were bricklayers.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.477 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: All right.

00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:10%
It's really-- it's an
esoteric fraternity that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:10%
practices ethical development
through the use of symbols

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:10%
and esoteric philosophy.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.502 align:middle line:10%
They do tend to be secretive.

00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:10%
At one time, they really
needed to be secretive

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.475 align:middle line:10%
because they believed
in things that

00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:00.975 align:middle line:10%
would have gotten you in a lot
of trouble back in the 1700s.

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha, OK.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.177 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: But they really
commanded the allegiance

00:02:04.177 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:10%
of some very powerful and
deeply substantive people,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:10%
including our own
founding father,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:10%
and they continue to this day.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to
say, wasn't this basis

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.682 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of the
Declaration of Independence?

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:10%
In fact, a large portion of
the signers of the Declaration,

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:10%
the framers of the Constitution,
Washington's generals

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:10%
were, in fact, Freemasons.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:10%
It was a fraternity
that believed

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:10%
in the protection of the
individual search for meaning.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:10%
So it fed in to a lot of
our early American ideals.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they understand
things like the Bill of Rights

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:90%
in that era, Mitch?

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they do this?

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.477 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
absolutely fascinating.

00:02:41.477 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:10%
The Bill of Rights
probably came most

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:10%
from the writings of Thomas
Jefferson, who was not himself

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:10%
a Freemason, but he believed
in the individual search

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:10%
for meaning.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:10%
He believed that above all
else in the New Republic,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:10%
you had to give the
individual freedom

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:10%
to arrive at his or her own
conception of a higher power.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The
Rosicrucians, were they

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:10%
the same as the Freemasons?

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.822 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: They
were closely linked.

00:03:03.822 --> 00:03:06.660 align:middle line:84%
The Rosicrucians were an occult
fraternity and brotherhood

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:84%
whose writing started to
appear above ground in Germany

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:90%
in the early 1600s.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.800 align:middle line:10%
And they espoused many
of the same ideals that

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:10%
later showed up in Freemasonry.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are these secret
societies so suspicious

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:90%
of so many people?

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Americans have
never really liked secrecy.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, there
was a reaction

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:10%
against Freemasons
going back to 1826

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.080 align:middle line:10%
during the presidency
of Andrew Jackson,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:10%
who himself was a
Freemason, by the way.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
back in the day

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.780 align:middle line:84%
were concerned about corruption
in American life, favoritism

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
in our legal system,
and they didn't

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:90%
like any kind of secrecy.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That sounds like today.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah, it sounds
a great deal like today.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes people
look in the right places.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they look
in the wrong places.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle line:10%
I think Freemasonry
has actually always

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:10%
been a gatekeeper
of good ideals.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.877 align:middle line:10%
But because they're private or
because they're clandestine,

00:03:54.877 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:10%
people have looked upon
them with suspicion.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.668 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mitch, what
would the Founding Fathers

00:03:58.668 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:84%
have said about the Civil War
and about the state of America

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.050 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: They
probably would have

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:10%
said that we have to
turn down the discourse.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.230 align:middle line:10%
We have to start to speak to
one another with less cynicism,

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:10%
with less sarcasm,
with less hostility.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:10%
You can't have a democracy if
we're at one another's throats.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:10%
I think they would have been
very concerned about that.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
that's happening today.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Without question.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were
talking to somebody

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:84%
who is on the other end of the
spectrum, who doesn't agree

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
with you, or you don't agree
with them, instead of dialogue,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:90%
it's bitterness.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:90%
It's hatred.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:90%
It's fighting.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.452 align:middle line:84%
We've lost what the Founding
Fathers intended for America.

00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Without question.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.420 align:middle line:10%
It's the gravest threat
to our democracy.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:10%
Now, personally, I have been
friends for about 10 years

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:10%
with Steve Bannon, who was
Trump's chief strategist.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.857 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Steve and I have
different political outlooks,

00:04:47.857 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:10%
but we both share an interest
in esoteric spirituality,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.813 align:middle line:10%
and we are friends.

00:04:51.813 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:90%
We are loyal to one another.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.597 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
scream at each other--

00:04:54.597 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Not at all.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --because you
don't agree with each other.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Correct.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.240 align:middle line:10%
We're friends, and we
build that friendship

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:10%
on a common interest in
esoteric spirituality,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.070 align:middle line:10%
but there's also a closeness
and there's a loyalty.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:10%
And we as Americans need
to start cultivating that

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:10%
with our neighbors.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about Manly P. Hall.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was he?

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.428 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: One of
my great heroes.

00:05:13.428 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Manly P. Hall was a scholar
of esotericism and the occult.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:10%
He lived and worked in
the city of Los Angeles

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:10%
for most of his
life, died in 1990,

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:10%
was friends with
Ronald Reagan, as I

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:10%
write about in a new book
called "The Secret History

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:10%
of America."

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:10%
And Manly wrote a
magisterial encyclopedia

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.920 align:middle line:10%
to a cult thought called "The
Secret Teachings of All Ages."

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.387 align:middle line:84%
It's been the biggest influence
of any book in my life.

00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wasn't there
a private person

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
who signed the Declaration
of Independence

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.527 align:middle line:90%
that Manly P. Hall discovered?

00:05:43.527 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Interestingly
enough, Manly Hall

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:10%
wrote that at the signing
of the Declaration,

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:10%
the spirits of the
delegates were wavering.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.600 align:middle line:10%
They were worried
that if they signed

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:10%
and lost the War
of Independence,

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:10%
they would be killed.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Manly wrote that there was some
secret agent of destiny who

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
stood up and gave such a
rousing speech at the signing

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:84%
of the Declaration that
the delegates rushed up

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:84%
to sign the document,
and the man then

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:90%
disappeared from the room.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I think the story is
fanciful, but it did

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:90%
capture the ideals of the day.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:10%
And Ronald Reagan was
very influenced by it

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:10%
because he retold the story
in speeches throughout the end

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.700 align:middle line:10%
of his career.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.342 align:middle line:10%
And he used the phraseology--

00:06:19.342 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.855 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --that came
directly from Manly's work.

00:06:21.855 --> 00:06:24.397 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What was so fascinating
about Manley P. Hall's work?

00:06:24.397 --> 00:06:26.188 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: What was
fascinating about him,

00:06:26.188 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:10%
George, is that he produced
"The Secret Teachings

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:10%
of All Ages," which is a massive
and magisterial book at the age

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.368 align:middle line:10%
of 27 years old in 1928.

00:06:34.368 --> 00:06:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did he
have that wisdom?

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
incredible, isn't it?

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystery.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a true mystery.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:10%
He was extraordinary.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:10%
He was not an ordinary man
and that all this material

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.923 align:middle line:10%
could have come out of
him at such a young age,

00:06:45.923 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:10%
it's an enduring
literary mystery.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He kind of reminds
me of a Napoleon Hill type

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:90%
character.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: In a certain
sense, and his output,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:10%
it almost like it
belonged to another age.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:10%
It was almost like he had
this power of prophecy,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:10%
in a certain way, where
something was just

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:10%
coming through him.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.085 align:middle line:90%
He was a remarkable man.

new documentary, aren't you?

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.335 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, sir.

00:07:06.335 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:10%
I am working on a new
documentary shot on location

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt about an occult book
called "The Kybalion," which

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:10%
was published here
in America in 1908,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:10%
and it claimed to be a retention
of some ancient Egyptian

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:10%
wisdom.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it tied
into the Kabbal?

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's not exactly
tied into the Kabbal,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.540 align:middle line:10%
but it does retain some ancient
Greek Egyptian wisdom called

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:10%
hermetecism, and it really
is a faithful reproduction

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:10%
of some of these ideas.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:10%
It's a mysterious
book in its own right.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look at
a preview of your documentary.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.126 align:middle line:90%

>> Humanity has always been
fascinated with ancient Egypt.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Egypt was
antiquity itself

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:90%
to the Hellenic civilizations.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And this has continued up
through the modern age,

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
particularly because
Egypt's language

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:90%
is a symbolic language.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.610 align:middle line:10%
And even after it was
decoded, so to speak,

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:10%
by the Rosetta Stone, it's still
retained many of its secrets

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:10%
because Egypt's traditions were
oral traditions and traditions

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.626 align:middle line:10%
encrypted within image
and architecture.

00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:90%

>>HOROWITZ: You know what?
that's an interesting question,

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:84%
George, because the
monuments and the symbols

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egypt, they have
a magnetic pull on all of us.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I think these were the
primeval insights of man.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:10%
I think that culture is
older than we've really

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.150 align:middle line:10%
come to understand, and I think
its symbols pull at something

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:10%
that's very deep in all of us.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.037 align:middle line:10%

>>HOROWITZ: Isn't it incredible?

00:08:52.093 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:10%
It's a symbol that,
of course, comes

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:10%
from ancient Egyptian
civilization,

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:10%
but the way it appears on
the back of our currency

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:10%
was inspired by Freemasonry.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.190 align:middle line:10%
And it's surrounded by this
beautiful Latin expression,

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:10%
"Annuit Coeptis
Novus Ordo Seclorum."

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.335 align:middle line:10%

>>HOROWITZ: To a degree,
it's hidden meaning.

00:09:15.975 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:10%
The Freemasons believed that
when the American republic was

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:10%
being founded, it joined a chain
of ancient civilizations going

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:10%
back to Egypt that venerated
the search for meaning.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:10%
And they believe that
was being resumed

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.035 align:middle line:10%
with the founding of America.

00:09:30.035 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With what happened
in ancient Egypt, which

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.190 align:middle line:84%
was thousands of years
ago, these principles

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:90%
still apply today.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.818 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did the
Egyptians know this?

00:09:38.818 --> 00:09:40.720 align:middle line:84%
How did they know the
principles of living?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.095 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
just incredible.

00:09:42.095 --> 00:09:44.730 align:middle line:10%
They had a much deeper and
richer knowledge of nature

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.100 align:middle line:10%
in the greatest sense
than I think we do.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:10%
And the great principle
of hermetecism

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:10%
was as above, so below.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:10%
And they understood
that as individuals we

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:10%
are reflections of the cosmos,
and the cosmos reflect us.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:10%
It's all one whole.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:10%
That was their great insight.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
people today in America

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.577 align:middle line:84%
living and practicing some
of the things of the past?

00:10:04.577 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I believe that's so.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:10%
I believe that's so.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:10%
I think some of
these ideas have been

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.773 align:middle line:10%
preserved within some
of the fraternities

00:10:10.773 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:10%
that we were talking about--

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:10%
Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:10%
I believe they appeared
within Manly Hall's work.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:10%
I believe they appeared
within the Kybalion.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:10%
And I think these principles
are not lost to us.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.600 align:middle line:10%
They have been retained
today in some measure.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how did they
obtain these principles?

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: There has always
been a sort of very slender,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:10%
thin, golden thread
between modern seekers

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle line:10%
and the thought of the ancients.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
It's been broken, and it has
been lost at various times.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:10%
But some of the
ancient works were

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.370 align:middle line:10%
preserved in writings
that were produced

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt in late antiquity.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:10%
They were hidden
away in monasteries.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:10%
They resurfaced during
the Renaissance.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:10%
And fortunately, some of this
has come down to us today.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mitch, Egypt has
fascinated and captivated us

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.350 align:middle line:90%
since we have been kids.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:90%

How advanced were
these people, anyway?

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
hard for us to say.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:10%
We've only come to understand
the language of hieroglyphs

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:10%
really in the past 200 years.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:10%
We're only getting a glimpse
of Egyptian civilization.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:10%
And I think based
on the theories

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:10%
of the late John
Anthony West and Robert

earthbound knowledge,

00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:84%
or was it obtained
from up there?

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
difficult to say, George.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:10%
These people were just
extraordinary figures.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:10%
I haven't researched the
ancient astronaut thesis myself,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:10%
but having worked
with West and Shock,

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.040 align:middle line:10%
I feel certain
that our timeline,

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:10%
the traditional
timeline, of Egypt

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:10%
does not account for the true
antiquity of that civilization.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember,
we still don't know

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:90%
how they built the pyramids.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: No, we don't.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We can't figure it out.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.738 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: We have theories.

00:12:00.738 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even with incredible
knowledge of architecture

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.540 align:middle line:90%
and building--

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That's
exactly correct.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --we can't
really figure it out.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That
is exactly correct.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.590 align:middle line:10%
We have theories.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.645 align:middle line:10%
We have certain ideas.

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:10%
The same is true for
other ancient monuments,

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:10%
like Stonehenge, how the
materials, the raw materials

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:10%
for Stonehenge, were moved
across vast distances.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.250 align:middle line:10%
We have theories, but
we really don't know.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Move it, lift it,
get it up there, it's crazy.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.092 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: We just don't know.

00:12:24.092 --> 00:12:27.160 align:middle line:10%
These civilizations had secrets
that we fully don't understand.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.320 align:middle line:10%
We have to venerate them.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.660 align:middle line:10%
We have to fall to our knees
before these civilizations.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I told you I thought
it was sound resonance, where

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
they basically
degravitized these blocks

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.948 align:middle line:84%
and floated them into place,
would you believe that?

00:12:40.948 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, I would
say it's an idea that's

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:10%
worth considering.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.380 align:middle line:10%
I take nothing off the
table because the past

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:10%
is really shrouded in mystery,
and we owe it our questioning.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.220 align:middle line:10%
We owe it our study.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you went
to Egypt, how close

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:90%
did you get to the pyramids?

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, very close.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Right up, George.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.560 align:middle line:90%
We went inside--

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
able to touch the--

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, absolutely.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:10%
In fact, our director,
Ronnie Thomas, and I

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:10%
got to go into temples
that people usually

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.400 align:middle line:10%
don't get to go into.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.160 align:middle line:10%
There's a temple to the
cat goddess, Sekhmet,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:10%
that we got to enter in Luxor.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And we did a ceremony,
which was deeply meaningful,

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:90%
inside that temple.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
It was pitch black
inside, guarded

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:84%
by a soldier with a
machine gun and a guide,

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:90%
who brought us inside.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle line:84%
We got up close and
personal with a lot

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:90%
of magnificent material.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel
spiritual when you're there?

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It hits you, does it?

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.548 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Not all the time.

00:13:28.548 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's a tough culture
to travel and to shoot film in,

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:10%
but there were moments in the
bowels of some of these temples

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.912 align:middle line:10%
where it would be impossible
to be a sensitive person

00:13:38.912 --> 00:13:40.870 align:middle line:10%
and not to feel something
shooting through you.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you
can just sense it.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:42.820 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Magnificent.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My father
was born there.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.205 align:middle line:90%
We're not Egyptian.

00:13:45.205 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, is that right?

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that's
where he was born.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.193 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: How wonderful.

00:13:48.193 --> 00:13:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
left when he was six.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I see.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's not
with us anymore.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:84%
He always wanted to go
back, and he never did,

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.890 align:middle line:84%
but it fascinated him to
be born in Cairo where

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:90%
all this was going on.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.028 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's magnificent.

00:14:02.028 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:10%
You feel something
on a physical scale.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.040 align:middle line:10%
Life is tough
there, but there are

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.257 align:middle line:10%
moments where you just
enter into a kind of silence

00:14:08.257 --> 00:14:10.090 align:middle line:10%
and you feel something
shooting through you.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And tell us about
the book, "The Kybalion."

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: "The Kybalion"
came out in 1908.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:10%
That's a book that has long been
considered shrouded in mystery.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:10%
The authorship is attributed
to three initiates,

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:10%
three initiates where a
man named William Walker

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:10%
Atkinson, who was a brilliant
and prodigious writer

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:10%
of new thought in the
early 20th century.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:10%
And he produced the book.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:10%
He later acknowledged
producing the book,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.650 align:middle line:10%
which is something that we
talk about in the documentary.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.760 align:middle line:10%
And he really created a
compendium, as best we have it,

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Greek Egyptian
spiritual psychology.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's a book
with seven principles.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:90%
They are straightforward.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.690 align:middle line:90%
They are applicable to life.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And knowing who the author
was doesn't do anything

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.220 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the
mystery of the book

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.713 align:middle line:84%
because he's really dealing with
material that goes back ages.

00:15:00.713 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful book.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some
of the principles?

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.123 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: One of the
core principles of the book

00:15:05.123 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:10%
is that everything that
goes on in the world

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:10%
is a kind of polarity.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.063 align:middle line:10%
Again, as above, so below.

00:15:10.063 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:10%
So that when you're
experiencing--

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yin and yang.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.480 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes,
yin and yang, that's

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.605 align:middle line:10%
another way of putting it.

00:15:14.605 --> 00:15:18.130 align:middle line:10%
So and this polarity exists
within our psychology as well,

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.770 align:middle line:10%
so that you can actually
reverse negative emotions

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:10%
and turn them into
positive ones,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.090 align:middle line:10%
as long as you can
identify their opposite.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:29.950 align:middle line:10%
So fear can turn into bravery.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:10%
Depression can turn
into enthusiasm.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.430 align:middle line:10%
Ennui or a state
of low energy can

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.530 align:middle line:10%
turn into boundless passion.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.002 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anxiety
into opportunity.

00:15:40.002 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:10%
We are part of a sliding
scale, and if you

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:10%
can identify where
you are on that scale

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.682 align:middle line:10%
through an act of mental
expression, mental wish,

00:15:50.682 --> 00:15:52.890 align:middle line:10%
you can actually slide to
the other end of the scale.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.265 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To a
person like you who

00:15:54.265 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:84%
is exposed to this
on a regular basis,

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.772 align:middle line:84%
has it changed your
views on anything?

00:15:58.772 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Without question.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:10%
You know, George, several years
ago, I wrote off "The Kybalion"

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:10%
as just being a kind of novelty
of early 20th century cultism.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:10%
And then I get back on the
scent trail of the book.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:10%
And there was one summer where
I read it five times in a row,

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:10%
and it really
transformed my search.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I felt so moved
and touched by it.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:10%
I realized this book
really did contain threads

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:10%
of the wisdom of the ancients.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds like
the more you read it,

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.300 align:middle line:84%
the more information
you get from it.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.290 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Precisely.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Because although there are a
lot of practical insights in it,

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:10%
the author said that he didn't
want to give you the methods.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.740 align:middle line:10%
Through experiment, you had to
arrive at the methods yourself.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Because only then
would you really

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:84%
come into understanding
them and applying them.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.688 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does the
title "Kybalion" mean?

00:16:41.688 --> 00:16:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: No one knows.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:90%
No one knows.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of a--

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
tied to the Kabbalah?

00:16:46.145 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: No, it's not
tied to Kabbalah precisely.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:10%
There's no mention of
Kabbalah in the book.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:10%
It seems to be a Helenized
version of Kabbalah,

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:10%
but he never explains
the meaning of the title,

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:10%
so another mystery.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now, with this
mystery, of course, what

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:10%
happened to him, the author?

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, gosh.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:06.550 align:middle line:10%
He was an extraordinary figure.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:10%
He produced dozens and dozens of
books in the early 20th century

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.345 align:middle line:10%
under pseudonyms like Yogi
Ramacharaka, Magus Incognito--

00:17:14.345 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why did they
hide their names?

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.387 align:middle line:10%
Because they could
get in trouble?

00:17:17.387 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, sometimes
he liked to dramatize things.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.030 align:middle line:10%
You know, the man
just literally wrote

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:10%
dozens of books under his own
publishing company in Chicago

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:10%
called the Yogi
Publication Society.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yogi.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes he would
use other names.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes he would
use French names.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Like, one of his names
was Theron Q. Dumont.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.970 align:middle line:10%
And I think he felt it would
give the books greater gravity

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.540 align:middle line:10%
if they seemed to be coming
from the pen of other people.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.600 align:middle line:10%
I think he felt that people
wouldn't believe one man could

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:10%
have produced all these books.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:10%
He was a little bit
like Manly Hall.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:10%
His output was incredible.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.917 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe he was
a marketing expert.

00:17:49.917 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, he was
that, among other things.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.850 align:middle line:90%
He was a lawyer.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:90%
He was a marketing expert.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:10%
He had a flair for drama,
but he was totally sincere.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.700 align:middle line:10%
And he really was one of
the greatest interpreters

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:10%
of new thought or
mind metaphysics.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now through all of
these esoteric principles

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.230 align:middle line:84%
that you have
investigated, are there

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:90%
mysteries behind them, Mitch?

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that are mysteries

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:84%
that were intertwined
where we had to figure out

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.447 align:middle line:90%
what the puzzle was?

00:18:18.447 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: There's no question.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I think we're
living with a great mystery

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:10%
right now in our
generation, which

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:10%
is if our minds are causative,
if our thoughts make things

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:10%
happen, and I
believe they do, why?

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.183 align:middle line:10%
Why should there be
any effect at all?

00:18:32.183 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:10%
And I try to go through some
of this in "The Miracle Club"

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:10%
and at least come up
with a theory of why

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:10%
our thoughts are causative.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:10%
I believe that
everything is going on

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:10%
at once, that everything
is in superposition.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:10%
And we select things or localize
things through our perceptions,

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:10%
through our focus.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe we live
in the linear world

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that we detect around us, but
that something more dynamic

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:84%
is happening, which
is why we have so much

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:58.950 align:middle line:84%
testimony of our thoughts
seeming to contribute

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:90%
to what really happens.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I think they actually
do, and we have

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.080 align:middle line:84%
to start trying to grapple,
at least in our time,

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.900 align:middle line:90%
with why that is.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a mystery.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
Midnight Archive?

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, the
Midnight Archive

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:84%
is a wonderful online
series about people

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:90%
who explore strange phenomena.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.250 align:middle line:10%
It's directed by my
friend Ronnie Thomas.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.430 align:middle line:10%
And Ronnie and I've done several
episodes on the Ouija board

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:10%
and on occult--

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, stay away
from Ouija boards.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.650 align:middle line:10%
I've softened on the
question, George.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:10%
I've softened on the question.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.170 align:middle line:10%
I won't discourage anybody
from experimenting.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:10%
I know there are fearsome
stories around Ouija,

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.232 align:middle line:10%
and I don't downplay
any of that.

00:19:33.232 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:10%
But there have been
wonderful discoveries, too,

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:middle line:10%
and I don't want to stifle
anybody's experience.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you actually
talked about the Ouija board

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:90%
on Midnight Archive.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.652 align:middle line:90%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The earliest aspect of the
spiritualist experience was

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:84%
the séance, people joining hands
around a table in a darkened

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
parlor and a medium,
usually a woman,

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:84%
who would go into a
kind of trance state,

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and spirits would
speak through her.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
But Americans went in
search of technologies

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:84%
to make the whole
experience easier

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and to find a way of
doing it themselves,

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.518 align:middle line:90%
to dispense with the medium.

00:20:07.518 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
people would engage

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:84%
in would be what became
known as automatic writing.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Somebody would simply hold
a quill in his or her hand

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and attempt to go
into a trance state

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and write some message
from the afterworld.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.610 align:middle line:84%
But that was unsatisfying
to a lot of people,

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.310 align:middle line:84%
because it produced
page after page

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:90%
of very meandering writing.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:84%
The French came up with
an interesting innovation

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
of their own called
the planchette,

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
which would allow people, either
individually or in groups,

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.820 align:middle line:84%
to take a kind of
little plank, which

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:84%
looks a great deal like a
little plank that revolves

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.380 align:middle line:90%
around the Ouija board today.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Only what the French
did was design

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:84%
a little board that was made of
wood that was on ball bearings.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And in the center
of the planchette,

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.930 align:middle line:84%
they had a hole where you
could insert a pencil.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.173 align:middle line:84%
And it would slide around
and write out messages

00:20:54.173 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:90%
from the spirit world.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed to be easier
than automatic writing.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:90%
But again, it could be tedious.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.340 align:middle line:90%
It could be time consuming.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And people seemed to feel
it produced page after page

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.210 align:middle line:90%
of barely intelligible writing.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So along came the
American engineers,

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:84%
and they created
all kinds of things

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.547 align:middle line:84%
with different pulleys,
and devices, and weights.

00:21:13.547 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the blueprints
of some of these things,

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
you'll find it hard
to imagine that people

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
felt that these objects could
have made anything much easier.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was another
development happening.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:84%
It was much simpler than
this whole wide array

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual telegraph devices.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was something that
was sometimes used at séances

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:90%
called the alphabet board.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It was just a very simple
board with the letters

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.260 align:middle line:84%
of the alphabet
printed out on it.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes a medium would
point to a certain letter,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and upon pointing to a
letter, if she received

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:84%
[KNOCKING] a spirit knock
or some sort of symbol

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.530 align:middle line:84%
from the other
world, that system

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:84%
would be used almost as
an occult telegraph system

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:90%
to spell out words.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along the line,
a group of spiritualists

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:84%
got the idea that you could
take all these innovations

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:84%
and unite them into one
beautiful, simple, small

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:84%
object, and that was
the talking board.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.990 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until
several years later

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:84%
that a group of
novelty manufacturers

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:84%
in the city of Baltimore got
together and put a patent

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:90%
on this object.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And Ouija began to be marketed
as a commercial object,

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:90%
as a toy, as a novelty.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.880 align:middle line:84%
My contention is
actually that Ouija never

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%
should have been able to
gain a patent in any case

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.880 align:middle line:84%
because patents are supposed
to be for inventions, not

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:90%
for discoveries.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.740 align:middle line:90%

>>HOROWITZ: Interesting.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My commercial
computer went out.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't run commercials.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.440 align:middle line:84%
The board that you control your
audio, the lights would go out.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't know who
was on and who wasn't.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:90%
It was awful.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I told my producer at the time--

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, Howard, get this thing
out of here and get it out now.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So he took it out,
walked down the hallway.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.407 align:middle line:90%
Everything went back on.

00:23:57.407 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Computers started working.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Interesting.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.193 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The board worked.

00:24:00.193 --> 00:24:02.490 align:middle line:84%
But he gave the Ouija board
to one of our news guys,

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.120 align:middle line:90%
a fellow by the name of Darryl.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.255 align:middle line:90%
Gave it to him as a gift.

00:24:05.255 --> 00:24:06.130 align:middle line:90%
He said, you take it.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK, great.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:90%
The next day, Darryl gets fired.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.550 align:middle line:84%
We run into him about
two weeks later.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're saying, god,
Darryl, how are you doing?

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about what happened.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:90%
He said, you know what?

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Ever since I had that
Ouija board from you guys,

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:90%
my life has been in the tubes.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, not only
did I get fired,

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:84%
but two days later, my
girlfriend dumped me.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I threw away the Ouija
board, and things started

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.190 align:middle line:90%
getting better for me again.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
it's very strange.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad he threw
the Ouija board away.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I was worried you were
going to present it

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.730 align:middle line:90%
to me as a gift after the show.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:90%
You never know what I've got.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I wanted
to breathe easier.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:10%
It's strange, George.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.760 align:middle line:10%
It is an object that
attracts unusual energy,

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.010 align:middle line:10%
and some people, like the
friend you were referencing,

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.510 align:middle line:10%
theorize that it's kind
of an invisible line

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.730 align:middle line:10%
to our own psyche and
our own subconscious.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.100 align:middle line:10%
But even if that's true,
what kinds of things

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.920 align:middle line:10%
are lurking in our psyche
and our subconscious

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:10%
if this is what's
coming out of it?

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.130 align:middle line:10%
It's a very strange object.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.990 align:middle line:10%
And when I was
growing up, as a kid,

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.450 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't so sure if there were
any occult properties to it.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.610 align:middle line:10%
Because I thought, look,
it's got a bar code.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:10.510 align:middle line:10%
It's in shrink wrap.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:10%
It's at the toy store.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.910 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter.

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you get it from, it
has some very potent and strange

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.780 align:middle line:90%
properties.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, our
agents obviously

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.868 align:middle line:84%
were into all kinds of
metaphysical things.

00:25:20.868 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, for sure.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weren't they?

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got them so
turned on by all this stuff?

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.570 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: They believed that
every aspect of life was sacred

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:10%
and that everything
that was going on

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:10%
was part of a continuum.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.140 align:middle line:10%
So if you could freeze in
time a certain moment--

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:10%
maybe you're using
a divinatory method,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.880 align:middle line:10%
like the I Ching or tarot
cards, or something else,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:10%
or the stars--

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.172 align:middle line:10%
if you could freeze in
time a certain moment,

00:25:43.172 --> 00:25:45.130 align:middle line:10%
they believed that you
might be able to discern

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.430 align:middle line:10%
everything else that's going
on, past, present, future.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Everything is like a three
dimensional photograph of life.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense,
you could use almost

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.420 align:middle line:84%
any pictogrammatic device
for foresight for prophecy.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they not have any
bad experiences with the Ouija

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.212 align:middle line:84%
board, or the talking board,
as they called it then?

00:26:04.212 --> 00:26:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Sure, sure.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.150 align:middle line:10%
Look, I think people had lots
of good and bad experiences,

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:10%
but we are so hungry to touch
something beyond the physical,

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:10%
beyond flesh and
bone, that I think

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.600 align:middle line:10%
we're very attached to anything
that seems to be a kind of line

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.072 align:middle line:10%
of communication to the unseen.

00:26:18.072 --> 00:26:20.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And it looks like it
was the French who brought us

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:10%
the planchette, the--

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.402 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: The French
brought us the planchette,

00:26:23.402 --> 00:26:26.080 align:middle line:10%
but it was good, old
do-it-yourself Americans who

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.680 align:middle line:10%
created the alphabet board and
finally took this French device

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:10%
and figured out how
to apply it in a way

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.530 align:middle line:10%
that everybody could understand.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now the
Ouija board is still

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.683 align:middle line:10%
being sold as a game by
Parker Brothers, isn't it?

00:26:36.683 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, for real.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time,
Parker Brothers

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.428 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to talk about it.

00:26:40.428 --> 00:26:43.960 align:middle line:10%
When I wrote my first article
on Ouija years ago, actually

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:10%
the public relations
person of Parker Brothers

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.330 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't get back to me.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.915 align:middle line:10%
So I wrote a letter directly to
the president of the company.

00:26:50.915 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:10%
And I said, look,
I'm just a guy trying

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.030 align:middle line:10%
to write an article about
this cultural artifact,

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:10%
and your PR people
won't respond to me.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.850 align:middle line:10%
Two days later, I heard
from the vice president

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.408 align:middle line:10%
to PR, who did get back to me.

00:27:01.408 --> 00:27:03.700 align:middle line:10%
But for a long time, they
didn't want to talk about it.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.742 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was a big
seller for them, wasn't it?

00:27:05.742 --> 00:27:06.640 align:middle line:90%
Probably still is.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It is nowadays.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a big seller
for many years.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Then it sort of fell off.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.850 align:middle line:10%
And I think they got
worried about the board's

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:10%
sinister associations.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.670 align:middle line:10%
They got worried about
boycotts and things like that.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:10%
But then they licensed
it to the movies,

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.495 align:middle line:10%
and these fairly successful
Ouija horror movies came out.

00:27:21.495 --> 00:27:23.828 align:middle line:10%
Now they're in love with the
Ouija board all over again.

00:27:23.828 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I will admit that I
bought one a long time ago.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
I've ever used it.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
where it is anymore.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.498 align:middle line:84%
I hope it's not in my
basement somewhere.

00:27:33.498 --> 00:27:34.298 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:27:34.298 --> 00:27:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But I did buy one.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.260 align:middle line:90%
I did buy one.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah, I have a
couple of antique boards.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:10%
I gave one away to
a friend recently.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:10%
I keep another--

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Nice guy.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.813 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Hopefully
he'll remain so.

00:27:44.813 --> 00:27:47.830 align:middle line:10%
And I do use it.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.552 align:middle line:10%
I do bring it out when friends
or guests want to use it,

00:27:50.552 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:10%
but I don't use it regularly.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:10%
I keep it up in my closet.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:10%
It's not something I
toy around with lightly.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is not
something that I play around

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.260 align:middle line:84%
with like a magic 8
ball or something.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I do take it seriously, and
I keep the antique board.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.255 align:middle line:90%
That's my one and only.

00:28:03.255 --> 00:28:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
séances if we can, Mitch.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, sir.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
big back in the 1800s.

00:28:08.345 --> 00:28:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, yeah.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.887 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
probably still big now.

00:28:10.887 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.860 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Séances simply
involve a group of people

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.800 align:middle line:10%
joining hands or touching
fingers around a table

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:10%
and using their group
energy, so to speak,

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.130 align:middle line:10%
to try and contact the spirits.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.730 align:middle line:10%
It was another American
innovation that started getting

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.420 align:middle line:10%
practiced in upstate New York,
and it was something that

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:10%
Americans exported in the 1850s
when séances began to occur

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.500 align:middle line:10%
in the salons of Paris and Rome.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:84%
But in its modern form, it
began right here in the US,

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.702 align:middle line:90%
and it is still practiced today.

00:28:40.702 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
somehow had something

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.750 align:middle line:84%
to do with the women's
rights movement?

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, yes, sir.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Back in the day,
most mediums were women,

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:10%
and it provided the
first opening in America.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.350 align:middle line:10%
This goes back to the
1840s, 1850s, for women

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.740 align:middle line:10%
to have a voice in the religious
and civic life of the country.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Séances were a big
deal back in the day.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:84%
People formed into
séance societies.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:03.430 align:middle line:10%
They had their own newspapers,
their own newsletters,

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:10%
and women who wanted to be
heard could be heard as leaders,

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:10%
as mediums, at the séance table.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.480 align:middle line:10%
And this coincided with the dawn
of the women's rights movement.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.110 align:middle line:84%
The two movements really
intersected for many years.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Lincoln White
House was big into séances.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, for real.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they not?

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:18.345 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: For real.

00:29:18.345 --> 00:29:20.140 align:middle line:10%
I read about this
in "Occult America."

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.800 align:middle line:10%
Abe and Mary Todd Lincoln
conducted at least two séances

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.480 align:middle line:10%
that we know about
in the White House.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.430 align:middle line:10%
They permitted a reporter
from the newspaper,

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:10%
the "Boston Gazette" to
be present at one of them.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.288 align:middle line:10%
And they did these in the
Red Room of the White House.

00:29:33.288 --> 00:29:34.580 align:middle line:10%
And it's absolutely remarkable.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Abe Lincoln was participating
in this occult ceremony

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.282 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of Americans
were at the time.

00:29:40.282 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't he have his
own dream of his assassination?

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, he did.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.410 align:middle line:10%
Lincoln had a lot
of prophetic dreams,

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.080 align:middle line:10%
and he had a dream of his
assassination, one of which

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:10%
involved seeing two images
of himself in a mirror,

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.612 align:middle line:10%
and then one of
the images faded.

00:29:52.612 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:10%
And Mary Todd interpreted that
as a dream of his own death.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now she was big
into this, too, wasn't she?

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.573 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Until
the end of her life.

00:29:58.573 --> 00:29:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Until the end of her life.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:10%
In fact, Mary Todd worked
directly towards the end of her

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.420 align:middle line:10%
life with one of the
young girls, Margaret Fox,

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:10%
who had popularized spiritualism
and séances in upstate New

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.170 align:middle line:10%
York.

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Mary Todd was a believer.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.118 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So was Nancy Reagan.

00:30:12.118 --> 00:30:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, for real.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:90%
For real.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The Reagans
spent 30 years of their lives

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in Southern California,
and they picked up

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.370 align:middle line:84%
on the social mores and the
practices of the region.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:10%
They were pals with the
psychic Jeane Dixon.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:84%
But Jeane failed to predict
Ron's rise to the White House.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:10%
So Nancy broke with
Jeane and later became

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:10%
pals with an astrologer
named Joan Quigley, who

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.450 align:middle line:10%
lived in San Francisco.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:10%
And she was friends
with Joan at the time

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.470 align:middle line:10%
when all this got exposed.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But Jeane
Dixon predicted

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy's assassination.

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: She did.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:47.150 align:middle line:10%
In 1956, speaking to
"Parade Magazine,"

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:50.540 align:middle line:10%
Jeane Dixon said that the next
presidential election would

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:55.610 align:middle line:10%
be won by a young brown
haired man, very robust,

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.220 align:middle line:10%
would have the support of
Labor, the support of the Labor

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.430 align:middle line:10%
Movement behind him, and would
die by an assassin's bullet

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.890 align:middle line:10%
in his first year in office.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:04.820 align:middle line:90%
Pretty eerie.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Pretty spot on.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.300 align:middle line:84%
In fairness, I also
have to say, Jeane

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:84%
made hundreds of predictions
that didn't come true.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But she did get a hit there, and
it made her famous, actually.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, after the fact.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.050 align:middle line:90%
I remember--

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:16.310 align:middle line:90%
After the fact.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --"Life" magazine
writing about her.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or "Look" magazine.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.742 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:31:20.742 --> 00:31:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she was
a pretty big story.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.110 align:middle line:84%
My mother used to
talk about her.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:25.527 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Jeane
was a big story.

00:31:25.527 --> 00:31:27.230 align:middle line:10%
And believe it or
not, Jeane actually

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:30.705 align:middle line:10%
had an Oval Office session
with Richard Nixon.

00:31:30.705 --> 00:31:31.505 align:middle line:90%
Not a president--

00:31:31.505 --> 00:31:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.592 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --known
for occult passions,

00:31:33.592 --> 00:31:35.300 align:middle line:84%
but they sat in the
Oval Office together.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:84%
She gave him advice on
a variety of things.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:10%
And the reason we
know about it is

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.780 align:middle line:10%
because it's preserved
on the Watergate tapes.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.700 align:middle line:10%
Nixon was recording almost
everything in the Oval Office

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.500 align:middle line:10%
at that time.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, again, she
was the one who predicted

00:31:47.625 --> 00:31:49.070 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy's victory over Nixon.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's true.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.970 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:10%
And Nixon's secretary was a
big fan of Dixon's, and she

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:10%
convinced him to have a session
with him, and he agreed.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're considered
an occult expert.

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean you dabble
with the dark side?

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I do, George.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I am a believing historian.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ee.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, I'm sorry.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm a nice guy, too, I think.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:13.280 align:middle line:10%
And I believe in
many of the things

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.620 align:middle line:10%
that I write about as an
experiment or as a seeker,

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.420 align:middle line:10%
as an explorer.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.040 align:middle line:10%
Of course, my conception
of what the dark side is,

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.320 align:middle line:10%
is different from
what people commonly

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.760 align:middle line:10%
mean when they use that term.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.000 align:middle line:10%
I have a code, a sense of
ethics, a sense of honor,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.470 align:middle line:10%
a sense of loyalty.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:30.350 align:middle line:10%
My wish is to do nothing that
would hurt, or humiliate,

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.962 align:middle line:10%
or harm anybody, but I am
very much an experimenter

00:32:33.962 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:10%
into the realms
that I write about.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But why do you
dabble with the dark side?

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.230 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, George,
I really believe--

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.270 align:middle line:10%
I have to be frank with
you and your listeners.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.940 align:middle line:10%
For a long time, I was
on the spiritual search,

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.440 align:middle line:10%
and I was asking myself,
what am I looking for?

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.760 align:middle line:10%
What am I looking for?

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.090 align:middle line:10%
And the simple
uncensored truth is

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.220 align:middle line:10%
that I came to feel
after a certain point

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:10%
that what I was
really looking for

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.720 align:middle line:10%
was personal power in the way
that someone like Nietzsche

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.490 align:middle line:10%
was looking for, for example.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.743 align:middle line:84%
And I came to that through
my sense of the occult

00:33:00.743 --> 00:33:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and through esoteric
spirituality.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And have
you found that?

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I think I have.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:05.930 align:middle line:10%
I've never been
happier in my life.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm 53 years old today.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.700 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing everything that
I wish to do in life.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.750 align:middle line:10%
I've never been happier.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.070 align:middle line:10%
I've never been surrounded
by a greater group of people

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.870 align:middle line:10%
that I love.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.725 align:middle line:10%
I've never had better
working relationships.

00:33:16.725 --> 00:33:19.100 align:middle line:10%
I feel I've come to things
that have been very personally

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.042 align:middle line:10%
important to me, which I wish
for you and everybody watching.

00:33:22.042 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
not an evil person.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I've known you for years.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't consider
you to be a bad person.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.627 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been
scared, though,

00:33:28.627 --> 00:33:30.170 align:middle line:90%
dabbling with the dark side?

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.600 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: In all honesty,
George, I have not.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.150 align:middle line:10%
I have not once been scared
dabbling with the dark side

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:10%
in my entire life.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:10%
And I've tried some
pretty far out things.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.060 align:middle line:10%
The search is very
important to me.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.980 align:middle line:10%
And again, although
I have a strong code

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.000 align:middle line:10%
of honor, a strong
code of ethics,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.150 align:middle line:10%
there's almost
nothing I won't try.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
tried tarot cards?

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.817 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, sure, I
work with them all the time.

00:33:50.817 --> 00:33:54.320 align:middle line:84%
I do readings for
myself, for other people.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.020 align:middle line:84%
I believe there is a
real strong foresightful

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.760 align:middle line:84%
quality to tarot cards, and
I use them quite frequently,

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.560 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about
the cards that seems to work?

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.500 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: You know, it's
an interesting question.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.080 align:middle line:10%
I've pondered that
frequently myself,

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.850 align:middle line:10%
and I think it goes back to what
we were talking about earlier.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.350 align:middle line:10%
It's possible that every
frozen moment in time

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:15.630 align:middle line:10%
demonstrates or symbolizes
everything that's going on.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:18.980 align:middle line:10%
So if you can use a
pictogrammatic device,

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.790 align:middle line:10%
like tarot, or like the I Ching,
or something along those lines,

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.159 align:middle line:10%
you can gain kind of a
multi-dimensional snapshot

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.590 align:middle line:10%
of everything that's
happening in a certain moment.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.400 align:middle line:10%
And in my experience,
they do seem to work.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What generates the
accuracy of the tarot cards,

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.400 align:middle line:84%
the individual who reads
them or the individual

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.613 align:middle line:90%
who is being read about?

00:34:37.613 --> 00:34:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That's a
wonderful question.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.253 align:middle line:10%
In my personal
experience, I think

00:34:41.253 --> 00:34:42.670 align:middle line:10%
it's the individual
who reads them

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:45.320 align:middle line:10%
because I will do distance
tarot readings for people,

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.120 align:middle line:10%
for example.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You pull the card?

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:48.880 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, yeah,
I'll pull cards for--

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.250 align:middle line:10%
I'll do a simple
three card spread.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.590 align:middle line:10%
And I'll pull cards for people
and communicate with them

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.699 align:middle line:10%
over email.

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:57.010 align:middle line:10%
Time, distance, the
person asking-- it

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:58.300 align:middle line:10%
doesn't seem to matter.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.700 align:middle line:10%
Most of the people who get
these readings come back to me

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.172 align:middle line:10%
and say, I did experience
something poignant.

00:35:03.172 --> 00:35:04.880 align:middle line:10%
I feel you put your
fingers on something.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you pull
one card or three?

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.702 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I pull
three cards, and I

00:35:07.702 --> 00:35:09.130 align:middle line:84%
look for a storyline
in the cards,

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.140 align:middle line:84%
almost as if I was
reading a comic strip.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.450 align:middle line:84%
I might read it right
to left, left to right.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I might have the two cards
impact on the center card.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.855 align:middle line:84%
But I'm looking for a
story within the images.

00:35:18.855 --> 00:35:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
the death card mean?

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.550 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Mm, good question.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.493 align:middle line:10%
Most of these things
are metaphorical.

00:35:24.493 --> 00:35:26.410 align:middle line:10%
If I were to pull the
death card for somebody,

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:29.440 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't say that
physical demise is eminent.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:10%
Most of the time, it does
signify the end of something.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.475 align:middle line:10%
And look, George, I've pulled
the death card for myself.

00:35:34.475 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:10%
There have been
relationships that I've

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.235 align:middle line:10%
been in that I very
much wanted to work,

00:35:38.235 --> 00:35:40.360 align:middle line:10%
and I've pulled the death
card and I've said, look,

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.895 align:middle line:10%
you can make
excuses, but you have

00:35:41.895 --> 00:35:44.020 align:middle line:10%
to come to terms with what
you're being shown here.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.813 align:middle line:10%
And those relationships did end.

00:35:45.813 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or a job or
anything like that.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, sure.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't necessarily
mean your life is over.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.983 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: No, it doesn't
mean your life is over.

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:54.850 align:middle line:10%
And look, you know, I think
that there have been things

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:57.225 align:middle line:10%
that I've wanted in life
that I have not gotten,

00:35:57.225 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:10%
and I have been very grateful
I haven't gotten them

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:01.517 align:middle line:10%
because they've opened the
door to something better.

00:36:01.517 --> 00:36:04.600 align:middle line:10%
And the thing I was pursuing may
have been ruinous in some way.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.205 align:middle line:10%
So no can be the best thing
that ever happens to us.

00:36:07.205 --> 00:36:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you the
modern day Alister Crowley?

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, that's a
very interesting question.

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:12.940 align:middle line:10%
I'd be very
flattered if somebody

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.950 align:middle line:10%
called me the modern
day Alister Crowley,

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:16.210 align:middle line:10%
although I would have to say--

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:17.043 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I just did.

00:36:17.043 --> 00:36:18.490 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Ah, you just did.

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:10%
I believe, personally
speaking, I

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.400 align:middle line:10%
strive to have a stronger
sense of personal ethics

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.250 align:middle line:10%
and a stronger code of honor
than I believe Crowley did.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.258 align:middle line:10%
Crowley was a great man,
but I would not personally

00:36:30.258 --> 00:36:32.800 align:middle line:10%
have been one of his students
because I think a lot of people

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:10%
got hurt around him.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think he
demonstrated sufficient loyalty

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.670 align:middle line:84%
or sufficient compassion
towards other people.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
thought he was evil.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He
cultivated that image.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.680 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to be
thought of as evil.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.910 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh,
he was the one who

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:47.380 align:middle line:10%
called himself the great beast.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.260 align:middle line:10%
And he loved when the English
tabloids would mix it up

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.980 align:middle line:10%
and call him names and so on.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.130 align:middle line:10%
He was a great artist.

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.370 align:middle line:10%
He was a great pioneer.

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.410 align:middle line:10%
And he was a great intellect.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:00.070 align:middle line:10%
But he didn't have a
sufficiently developed sense

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:01.370 align:middle line:10%
of personal ethics.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.640 align:middle line:10%
And I think that was his
downfall as a teacher.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your latest book is
called "The Miracle Club."

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, sir.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the miracle club?

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:09.507 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: The miracle club
was a group of occult seekers

00:37:09.507 --> 00:37:12.010 align:middle line:10%
who gathered in New
York City in 1875,

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:14.620 align:middle line:10%
and their wish was to
explore the beyond.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.200 align:middle line:10%
And they included people
like Madame HP Blavatsky,

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.510 align:middle line:10%
the great co-founder
of theosophy.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:21.670 align:middle line:10%
And they only stayed
together a few months,

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.500 align:middle line:10%
but they were very influential.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.440 align:middle line:10%
They formed the larger
theosophical organization

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.970 align:middle line:10%
that's so popular today.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.780 align:middle line:10%
And their slogan was one word--

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.580 align:middle line:10%
try.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.570 align:middle line:10%
Try.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.160 align:middle line:10%
And I was very
inspired by that so I

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:10%
named the new book an homage
to the original miracle club.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.018 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The laws of success,
tell us about Napoleon Hill.

00:37:39.018 --> 00:37:41.560 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Napoleon Hill has
been a great inspiration on me.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.390 align:middle line:10%
He wrote the book,
"Think and Grow Rich."

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:44.300 align:middle line:90%
And his writing is very--

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was his big book.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.517 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That
was his big book.

00:37:46.517 --> 00:37:48.050 align:middle line:90%
His writing is very simple.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:49.250 align:middle line:90%
It's very accessible.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.360 align:middle line:10%
But his ideas were much
richer and much deeper

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:10%
than I think most
people have understood.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:57.340 align:middle line:10%
And I tell you, George, I
reread "Think and Grow Rich"

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.870 align:middle line:10%
once every year.

00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:59.770 align:middle line:10%
I love the man.

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I love the book.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.055 align:middle line:84%
It's been a huge
help in my life.

00:38:02.055 --> 00:38:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
a vintage clip of him.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.124 align:middle line:90%

you forget all your problems

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:12.520 align:middle line:84%

the master key with which you

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.550 align:middle line:84%
may unlock the door for any
opportunities that your mind

can conceive.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:22.270 align:middle line:84%
The master key consists of 17
principles, the first of which

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:90%
is definiteness of purpose.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Right here at the

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make you a promise.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.750 align:middle line:84%

The exact moment when I will
deliver this master key to you

will depend entirely upon when
you are ready to receive it.

>>HOROWITZ: Yes,
they did look alike.

00:39:16.222 --> 00:39:19.550 align:middle line:10%
And I love the clip that you
selected because Hill really

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:20.350 align:middle line:10%
lays it out.

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:23.470 align:middle line:10%
He said the first point,
the key to everything

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:25.420 align:middle line:10%
is to have a definite chief aim.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.010 align:middle line:10%
It's so vital.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.652 align:middle line:10%

Thoughts are causative.

>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.918 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It means that
your thoughts will actually

00:39:37.918 --> 00:39:41.730 align:middle line:10%
make things happen, but only
if you are absolutely focused.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.820 align:middle line:10%
You have to have one
passionate desire that you

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.315 align:middle line:10%
want like breath itself.

>>NOORY: It's

>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.760 align:middle line:10%
But most of us go
through life having

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.010 align:middle line:10%
a whole mishmash of
competing desires,

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:56.552 align:middle line:10%
or we're afraid to choose one
desire, or we tell ourselves,

00:39:56.552 --> 00:39:58.260 align:middle line:10%
we know what our desire
is without really

00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:10%
being frank about it.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.400 align:middle line:10%
And Hill's genius was
he realized all this.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.710 align:middle line:10%
He realized this problem
in human nature, which

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:07.980 align:middle line:10%
is that we think we know what
we want without really asking

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:11.190 align:middle line:10%
ourselves that question in
a mature, and unembarrassed,

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.215 align:middle line:10%
and intimate way.

00:40:12.215 --> 00:40:14.340 align:middle line:10%
If you could do that-- and
you have to tell anybody

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.810 align:middle line:10%
the answer, it's private--

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:18.180 align:middle line:10%
but if you can
arrive at that aim,

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.550 align:middle line:10%
things start happening in
your life, and all the tools

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:22.813 align:middle line:10%
that Hill talks about
become available to you.

00:40:22.813 --> 00:40:23.730 align:middle line:90%
That's the master key.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
this manifestation?

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:27.240 align:middle line:90%
What about negativity?

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.910 align:middle line:84%
What if negativity pops
up, crops up in this?

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.358 align:middle line:90%
Does that kind of temper it?

00:40:31.358 --> 00:40:33.150 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It can
temper it, but the truth

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.340 align:middle line:10%
is if you really know
what you want in life,

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.250 align:middle line:10%
not only does it serve to
amp up your enthusiasm,

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:10%
but it will keep
negativity at bay.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:42.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm wracked with
negative thoughts.

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.730 align:middle line:10%
I've never struggled
with depression,

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:47.720 align:middle line:10%
but I have struggled
with anxiety all my life.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.490 align:middle line:10%
And I've found that when I came
in touch with what I really

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:54.000 align:middle line:10%
wanted to be doing in
life, that anxiety receded.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.190 align:middle line:10%
It didn't vanish,
but it receded.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:59.490 align:middle line:10%
Having that one
obsessive passionate aim

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.230 align:middle line:10%
can do so much
for an individual.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
written that there

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:05.430 align:middle line:84%
is one vital step that's
important to using

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.540 align:middle line:90%
these powers of the mind.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.110 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.068 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's focus.

00:41:08.068 --> 00:41:08.970 align:middle line:10%
It's absolute focus.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:10.480 align:middle line:10%
It's the law of nature.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.230 align:middle line:10%
If you look at nature,
focus is the central law

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:15.210 align:middle line:10%
that creates force.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:18.360 align:middle line:10%
Photons of light
focused become a laser.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:10%
And most of us don't focus.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.370 align:middle line:10%
We have a wide dispersed
range of competing aims.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.930 align:middle line:10%
Some of them are in direct
contradiction to one another.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.950 align:middle line:10%
But if you can get down
to the one thing you want,

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:30.600 align:middle line:10%
it can be
extraordinarily powerful.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.830 align:middle line:10%
We fear doing that.

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.860 align:middle line:10%
We fear it because look, life
does make multiple demands

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:35.660 align:middle line:10%
on us.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.420 align:middle line:10%
We're parents.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.050 align:middle line:10%
We're workers.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:37.950 align:middle line:10%
We're homemakers.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:39.820 align:middle line:10%
We're interested in our careers.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.360 align:middle line:10%
And I understand we all
have to fill those shoes.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.080 align:middle line:84%
But the tough, if
transcendent, bargain

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that life strikes with us is
if you can choose one aim,

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.770 align:middle line:84%
it will open up
extraordinary doors to you.

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: ESP, Extra
Sensory Perception,

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:56.100 align:middle line:90%
what does that tell you?

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: ESP has
been demonstrated

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.140 align:middle line:90%
in laboratory settings.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:03.390 align:middle line:10%
The work of my
hero, JB Rhine, who

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:07.530 align:middle line:10%
pioneered scholarly ESP studies
at Duke University, that

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:08.580 align:middle line:10%
alone tells us that.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:12.570 align:middle line:10%
JB was able to demonstrate
that certain individuals were

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:16.500 align:middle line:10%
able to pass information back
and forth under strenuously

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.380 align:middle line:10%
controlled conditions
somewhere in a way that

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:10%
went beyond the five senses.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And JB, for decades and
decades, assembled this data.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.680 align:middle line:90%
No one's overturned it.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.450 align:middle line:90%
No one's disproved it.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:29.850 align:middle line:10%
People won't wrestle with
the implications of it

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:33.810 align:middle line:10%
because the implications of JB's
data and the data of Dean Radin

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:36.000 align:middle line:10%
and other people in
this field are that we

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.890 align:middle line:10%
have a non-physical existence.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.620 align:middle line:10%
We are not just flesh and bone.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.620 align:middle line:10%
Information can pass
between us and other people

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.062 align:middle line:10%
in an extra sensory manner.

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever look at
the work of my late aunt, Dr.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.942 align:middle line:90%
Shafica Karagulla?

00:42:48.942 --> 00:42:51.150 align:middle line:84%
She wrote a book called
"Breakthrough to Creativity."

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:53.070 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I know the name,
but I have not looked at it.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was a dear
friend of Ingo Swann,

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.360 align:middle line:90%
the remote viewer.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Sure.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she
was a psychiatrist.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Got her degree from
Oxford University

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and decided to change her
entire practice from psychiatry

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.307 align:middle line:90%
to studying telepathy and ESP.

00:43:08.307 --> 00:43:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: How wonderful.

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.973 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
she wanted to do.

00:43:10.973 --> 00:43:12.880 align:middle line:84%
She ended up dying
in Beverly Hills

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.390 align:middle line:84%
when a radio fell into her
tub, and she was taking a bath.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Wow.

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:18.607 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm
saying to myself,

00:43:18.607 --> 00:43:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I hope to God she wasn't
listening to my show

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:21.840 align:middle line:90%
when that happened.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Thank god I wasn't
on the air then.

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:29.310 align:middle line:84%
But she devoted her entire
practice to telepathy and ESP,

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and she wrote incredible
books and research

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:34.312 align:middle line:84%
that it really works
and it's powerful.

00:43:34.312 --> 00:43:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I celebrate that.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.550 align:middle line:10%
I celebrate that because I
think when a lot of us go to see

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:40.770 align:middle line:10%
shrinks, when a lot of
us go to see therapists--

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.670 align:middle line:10%
and I go to one myself--

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.790 align:middle line:10%
I think it's because we
feel a frustrated sense

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.720 align:middle line:10%
of personal power in our lives.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.130 align:middle line:10%
But when somebody can expose
us to methods and ideas that

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.470 align:middle line:10%
amp up our sense
of personal power,

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:middle line:10%
our sense that we can
get done in the world

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.240 align:middle line:10%
that which we seek to
do, these things that we

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.460 align:middle line:10%
consider neuroses begin to
recede into the distance.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.900 align:middle line:10%
I think a lot of what we
consider to be neuroses,

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.770 align:middle line:10%
or problems, or anxieties
reflect a frustrated sense

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:08.940 align:middle line:10%
of personal power.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Have you
had cases of deja vu?

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.170 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I have
had many cases of what

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.960 align:middle line:10%
I would call time collapses,
where past, present,

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.300 align:middle line:10%
and future seem to be
playing out all at once.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like you know
what's going to happen.

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:19.835 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:44:19.835 --> 00:44:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Feeling.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:20.745 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:44:20.745 --> 00:44:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a weird feeling.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.363 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's a
very weird feeling,

00:44:23.363 --> 00:44:25.290 align:middle line:10%
and it gives you a
sense that time may not

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.250 align:middle line:10%
be what we think it is.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:29.300 align:middle line:10%
We think of this very
orderly linear time,

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.700 align:middle line:10%
but that just may be a
necessary device that we

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.110 align:middle line:10%
use to get through the day.

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:35.570 align:middle line:10%
It may be that everything
is going on at once, which

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.550 align:middle line:10%
is what we understand
when we experience

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:39.383 align:middle line:10%
deja vu, or synchronicity,
or time collapse.

00:44:39.383 --> 00:44:41.008 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, assuming
there's nothing

00:44:41.008 --> 00:44:42.270 align:middle line:10%
medically wrong with you.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:44.270 align:middle line:84%
You don't have some kind
of tumor in your brain.

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, sir.

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I am convinced
that deja vu is

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.740 align:middle line:84%
a crossing over of two
dimensions where there are

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.620 align:middle line:84%
two Georges or two
Mitch Horowitzes,

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and the one that's already
experienced that event somehow

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.923 align:middle line:84%
crosses over, and
you pick it up.

00:45:00.923 --> 00:45:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, I think
that's very well put.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.257 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's actually
backed up by things that we've

00:45:05.257 --> 00:45:09.050 align:middle line:10%
seen in 80 years of quantum
physics experiments, where

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:12.710 align:middle line:10%
a particle can be in a so-called
state of superposition.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:14.840 align:middle line:84%
It can be everywhere
at once until somebody

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.890 align:middle line:90%
takes a measurement.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:16.970 align:middle line:90%
Then it gets localized.

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:19.010 align:middle line:90%
But it was in a wave state.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.230 align:middle line:84%
It was in this state
of superposition.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's akin to
what you're describing.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
your new works?

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.412 align:middle line:90%
What are you working on, Mitch?

00:45:25.412 --> 00:45:28.010 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, I just
completed a 12-part video

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:31.500 align:middle line:10%
series about the secret
teachings of all ages.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:34.730 align:middle line:10%
That's the great work
produced by Manly P. Hall.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.460 align:middle line:10%
That will go up at the
website of the University

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.970 align:middle line:10%
of Philosophical
Research in June of 2019.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:42.800 align:middle line:10%
It's a 12-part
series that explores

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.390 align:middle line:10%
all the occult and esoteric
themes in the book.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:48.180 align:middle line:10%
I just shot it in Los
Angeles last week.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm very proud of it.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you travel
around the country still?

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Quite a bit.

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.680 align:middle line:10%
I'll be speaking in
Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.480 align:middle line:10%
I'll be speaking
in Virginia Beach.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.540 align:middle line:10%
I'll be speaking in Kansas
City, traveling all around.

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And I love meeting
fellow seekers.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.687 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And people love
this topic, don't they?

00:46:03.687 --> 00:46:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: They do.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.320 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.690 align:middle line:10%
They love feeling like in a
free-flowing, and intelligent,

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:10.940 align:middle line:10%
and practical way,
they can talk about

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:12.800 align:middle line:10%
occult and esoteric ideas.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.560 align:middle line:10%
Not feel like they have to
put any label on themselves,

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.610 align:middle line:10%
not feel anybody's
looking at them strange,

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:19.392 align:middle line:10%
but just have a
grown-up discussion.

00:46:19.392 --> 00:46:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And occult
doesn't mean evil, does it?

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: No, sir.

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:22.820 align:middle line:90%
It means hidden.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.425 align:middle line:10%
It comes from the Latin
word occultis or occultum.

00:46:25.425 --> 00:46:27.050 align:middle line:10%
And it's a word that
came into practice

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:10%
during the Renaissance,
where scholars were trying

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.340 align:middle line:10%
to figure out how
to refer to all

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.190 align:middle line:10%
these ideas from Egyptian
and Greek civilization

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:35.623 align:middle line:10%
that they were rediscovering.

00:46:35.623 --> 00:46:37.790 align:middle line:10%

>>NOORY: Fascinating subjec--

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.490 align:middle line:10%
ESP, the occult,
and what is really

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:45.920 align:middle line:10%
going on in the human mind.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.880 align:middle line:84%
