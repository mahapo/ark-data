He has since completed 5 films for the likes of Sci-Fi and History Channel and has made frequent appearances on the Larry King Show, Night Line, Dateline, Anderson Cooper and others.

The next morning fields were strewn with debris of a mysterious material bedecked with strange symbols. The military quickly swooped in to collect the wreckage and inadvertently told the world what they found. Upon the very next morning an intensive cover-up and disinformation campaign began, which remains intact to this day.

Nick Redfern has extensively researched Roswell and has come away with a new theory that is even more controversial than extraterrestrial visitation. A new investigation was opened in 1993 which disclosed details suggesting that the wreckage was from a classified weaponized-balloon program. At the time, the U.S. and Japan both actively tested high altitude balloons for military applications. Sometimes they were fitted with explosives, other tests used animal subjects or humans.

So, he is working on developing a new scientific understanding of subtle energy, the duality of reality, and life force so that we can better understand the energetic nature of human wellbeing.","teaser":"Randy Veitenheimer, host of Quantum Effect, discusses the energetic nature of the human body, our consciousness, and how this energy affects our wellbeing, life and death.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/4035acea-c847-417f-8209-8f3f6bb06ff6?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b80a17ac-6751-4f21-94e1-d9adfa2a7870?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b80a17ac-6751-4f21-94e1-d9adfa2a7870?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b80a17ac-6751-4f21-94e1-d9adfa2a7870?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Randy Veitenheimer"},{"seriesId":30036,"seriesTitle":"Beyond Belief","seriesPath":"series/beyond-belief","seriesVoteDownCount":2316,"seriesVoteUpCount":19221,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/71df6fee-0bcb-42d6-9d7f-b3e0a15b3dd9?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","created":"2019-10-02","episode":9,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b140af77-8f6b-4f59-95e3-9608ddf8bdd7?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/1f092cec-2cab-4576-be4a-a4bde869c04c?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":"George Noory","meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/missing-21-trillion-catherine-fitts","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/71df6fee-0bcb-42d6-9d7f-b3e0a15b3dd9?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","published":true,"season":12,"title":"The Missing $21 Trillion with Catherine Fitts","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26618","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"Coverups","weight":0},{"content_id":"207970","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/coverups","name":"Coverups","weight":1},{"content_id":"122041","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/financial-system","name":"Financial System","weight":1},{"content_id":"120676","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/secret-space-program","name":"Secret Space Program","weight":1},{"content_id":"26649","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"genre/interview","name":"Interview","weight":0},{"content_id":"28536","content_type":"person","reference_type":"interview-host","language":"en","path":"person/george-noory","name":"George Noory","weight":0},{"content_id":"207742","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/9-coverups-rc","name":"9 - Coverups RC","weight":0},{"content_id":"120016","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"site_segment","language":"en","path":"seeking-truth","name":"Seeking Truth","weight":1}],"voteDownCount":19,"voteUpCount":426,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":575,"seasonCount":25,"preview":{"duration":84,"mediaId":184091,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":184091,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":3214,"mediaId":184092,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":184092,"isFree":false},"id":184064,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"$21 trillion dollars is missing from the U.S. federal government!
