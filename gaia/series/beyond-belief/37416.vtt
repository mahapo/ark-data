00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think many people
today don't know what

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.272 align:middle line:90%
to believe anymore.

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:07.774 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically --
keep on up to [inaudible].

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:10.577 align:middle line:84%
>> It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.612 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:14.814 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told the
entire story.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.391 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.994 align:middle line:84%
You know, mankind has always
looked toward the heavens to try

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:32.532 align:middle line:84%
to decide, is there
extraterrestrial life out there.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.501 align:middle line:90%
So far, we've been unsuccessful,

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.803 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean
we're not trying.

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:39.039 align:middle line:84%
There's an organization
called the " Search

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.409 align:middle line:84%
for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence" and Seth Shostak,

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.678 align:middle line:84%
of course, is the
chief astronomer.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.012 align:middle line:90%
Seth, always a pleasure.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Seth Shostak: My
pleasure to be here, George.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Tell us a
little about SETI,

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
how it was created
and what you all do.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well,
SETI, of course,

00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:55.121 align:middle line:90%
it's a generic acronym, right?

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.157 align:middle line:84%
It also happens to be the
name of the organization

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that employs me, so [laughter]
that's the SETI Institute.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.729 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is to try and find
life beyond earth, you know,

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.731 align:middle line:84%
cosmic life, life
in the universe,

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:05.965 align:middle line:90%
but not just any kind of life.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:09.836 align:middle line:84%
It has to be intelligent
and from our point of view,

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.504 align:middle line:84%
what does that mean,
people ask me all the time,

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:12.305 align:middle line:90%
intelligent life.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: [Inaudible].

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.541 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah, right exactly,

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.076 align:middle line:84%
is there any intelligent life
inside the beltway, or whatever.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.277 align:middle line:90%
They like to make jokes.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.244 align:middle line:90%
That's okay.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.746 align:middle line:84%
We have a really
simple definition.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:23.583 align:middle line:84%
If you can build a radio
transmitter so we could find you

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.719 align:middle line:84%
by eavesdropping
on those signals

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.654 align:middle line:84%
that we call you
intelligent, so, you know,

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:84%
the audience should
simply ask themselves,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.524 align:middle line:84%
"Can I build a radio
transmitter?"

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:32.559 align:middle line:90%
No. no.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How did
you conceive of this

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.626 align:middle line:90%
or who conceived of this?

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:36.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, the idea
is actually a very old one.

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.665 align:middle line:84%
The idea that you
might be able to signal

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.066 align:middle line:90%
from one world to another.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.602 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that goes back to the
time of the American civil war,

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.604 align:middle line:84%
actually, I mean the
people in Europe.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:48.041 align:middle line:84%
Some legitimate scientists
who thought, you know,

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.576 align:middle line:84%
"There might be somebody
on Mars."

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.578 align:middle line:84%
Okay? So, maybe we
can get in touch,

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:55.215 align:middle line:84%
what we'll do is we'll build big
lanterns essentially, you know,

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:56.249 align:middle line:90%
sort of search-like lanterns.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have electric light

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.219 align:middle line:84%
but they had gas
lights, so, you know.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.055 align:middle line:84%
And just string these out
through some cities in Europe

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and make them into a
shape of the Big Dipper

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.160 align:middle line:84%
or something like, and
signal our buddies on Mars.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.928 align:middle line:84%
Okay. That probably
wouldn't have worked given

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:10.230 align:middle line:84%
that there aren't
any buddies on Mars.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.564 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It was not a bad idea.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:14.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: It was a perfectly
legitimate idea in a way.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.236 align:middle line:90%
It looks kind of quaint today.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:19.773 align:middle line:84%
But, by the 900s, we had
invented radio, right?

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:21.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And many people
will recognize right away,

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.379 align:middle line:84%
including guys like Nikola
Tesla and Edison and Marconi,

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.151 align:middle line:84%
these guys all realized that
radio can go between planets,

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.385 align:middle line:84%
between the stars
because, you know,

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
you don't need air
and stuff like that.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.455 align:middle line:90%
So, they all tried.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.457 align:middle line:90%
They all -- in fact, both Tesla

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:39.526 align:middle line:84%
and Marconi thought they
had heard the Martians.

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.227 align:middle line:90%
So, the idea goes way back.

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Theoretically, do
these radio transmissions

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.367 align:middle line:84%
that emanate from our
planet, old-time broadcasts,

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:51.271 align:middle line:84%
for example, as they're
beamed out into space

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:54.974 align:middle line:84%
and they just keep going
and going and going,

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:58.478 align:middle line:84%
do they diminish in strength
or can they be picked

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.613 align:middle line:90%
up eventually somewhere?

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Of course,
radio waves do get weaker

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.918 align:middle line:84%
with distance, I mean,
that's just geometry really.

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.886 align:middle line:84%
Think about it, you can
take a laser pointer, right?

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.855 align:middle line:84%
You can go out at night, aim
it at the neighbors house,

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.557 align:middle line:90%
you see a red spot or whatever.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:11.891 align:middle line:90%
You could aim it at a star.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that light will get
to the star, but it won't be

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.995 align:middle line:84%
as bright a spot
[inaudible] if you wil.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.564 align:middle line:84%
Okay? So radio waves
are the same.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.465 align:middle line:84%
They get weaker with
distance, but that's okay.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean you
can't pick them up.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.402 align:middle line:84%
Think of what you do at night
when you go out and look

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.904 align:middle line:84%
at a star that might be
hundreds of light years away

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:27.373 align:middle line:84%
and your little eyeball
can still see it.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So, when you aim
these radio transmissions,

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.212 align:middle line:90%
where are you aiming?

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:35.348 align:middle line:84%
Is it just blank it or are
you pinpointing at something?

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, to begin
with, we don't transmit at all.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.319 align:middle line:90%
We'll leave that to you, okay?

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.421 align:middle line:84%
So, what we do is
we just listen.

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:42.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You just listen?

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: We just listen.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:46.458 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, some of those
experiments might depend a

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:49.162 align:middle line:84%
little bit on them
beaming something our way,

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:51.497 align:middle line:84%
it could be that, but we
just point the antennas

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.366 align:middle line:84%
in the directions where
we think, you know,

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.034 align:middle line:84%
that's an interesting
star system.

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:57.604 align:middle line:84%
It might have a planet where
there are intelligent beings

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.839 align:middle line:84%
who knows and we'll just
listen in that direction

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.741 align:middle line:84%
over a wide range
of the radio dial.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: When we get reports --
of UFO reports, and we're going

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:06.746 align:middle line:84%
to get in to that
with you in a second,

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:11.184 align:middle line:84%
do you sometimes turn
these listening devices

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.119 align:middle line:90%
to those areas?

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well,
we don't, actually.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, I think that
the UFO reports are always

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.057 align:middle line:90%
after the fact, right?

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.192 align:middle line:84%
You know, they see
something in the sky,

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.160 align:middle line:90%
it's floating across the sky.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.897 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, the equipment
used by astronomers is very,

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:26.599 align:middle line:90%
very poor for, you know,

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.768 align:middle line:84%
following something that's
moving quickly across the sky.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.170 align:middle line:84%
It would be like, calling up
a, you know, the telescopes

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.374 align:middle line:84%
on Hawaii, or Mount Palomar,
or Mount Wilson, or something

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:35.875 align:middle line:84%
and say, "Hey, I
just saw a meteor.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:36.643 align:middle line:90%
You ought to follow it."

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:37.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: There's no
way they can do that.

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:40.346 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What about cases of
like Barney and Betty Hill,

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:43.716 align:middle line:84%
this abduction case from
the '60s where they claim

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.618 align:middle line:84%
that they're from a
certain star system.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:46.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:48.688 align:middle line:84%
I think it's Zeta Reticuli,
I may be mistaken there,

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:49.856 align:middle line:90%
but that's what they claim.

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:51.457 align:middle line:90%
Well, to be honest, you know,

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.559 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there was enough
scientific justification

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.928 align:middle line:90%
to look in that direction.

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:57.263 align:middle line:84%
Those stars are actually quite
young, and when I say young,

00:04:57.263 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, 50 million years, that
would be good for you and me

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.801 align:middle line:90%
to get to 50 million years.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: But for a star,
that's still so young that even

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.407 align:middle line:84%
if it has planets
that are habitable,

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
even if life is cooked up in
one of those, it hasn't had time

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
to evolve to something
pretty complex by now.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.449 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, we actually
did look at Zeta Reticuli

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.351 align:middle line:90%
because it's a nearby star.

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:19.452 align:middle line:90%
They were coy.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:21.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Have we ever
heard anything yet?

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, we get
signals all the time,

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:25.725 align:middle line:84%
but we haven't heard any signals
yet, but we say, "You know,

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:28.594 align:middle line:84%
that's not interference from our
own activities here on Earth.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:32.565 align:middle line:84%
Everything we found so far has
either just remained mysterious

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:33.967 align:middle line:90%
because it was only seen once.

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:35.368 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Or, it's something
that we check it out right away

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.339 align:middle line:84%
within a few minutes, we
go back, we look again,

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.075 align:middle line:84%
do we see it again, and all of
them fall through the cracks.

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:44.611 align:middle line:84%
None, of them has
made the grade.

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:47.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Is it the latest
kind of technology right now

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:48.448 align:middle line:90%
in terms of listening?

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:49.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yes.

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:50.583 align:middle line:84%
You always try and
upgrade your technology,

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:51.784 align:middle line:90%
and why do you do that?

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:53.353 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, you want
to be state of the art

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.254 align:middle line:84%
that gives you more
-- I don't know,

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
more hefty at your
local cocktail party,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.758 align:middle line:90%
but it's more than that.

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
With the latest technology,
what can you do

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.296 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't have done,
say, two or five years ago?

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.664 align:middle line:90%
And usually what it means is

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:05.932 align:middle line:84%
that you can do whatever
you're doing.

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:08.968 align:middle line:84%
You can do it faster and
you have more sensitivity

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:11.938 align:middle line:84%
so you get weaker
signals if there are any.

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:14.173 align:middle line:84%
But, just being able to do
it faster means that instead

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.575 align:middle line:90%
of looking at, you know,

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:17.777 align:middle line:84%
a couple of star systems every
day, you might be able to look

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:19.178 align:middle line:84%
at a hundred star
systems every day.

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:20.713 align:middle line:84%
And that means, you
know, you're looking

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.115 align:middle line:90%
for a needle in the haystack.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:25.284 align:middle line:84%
And if you placed a teaspoon,
you know, with a skip loader,

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:26.719 align:middle line:90%
or a shovel, or something,

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.721 align:middle line:84%
the chances that
you'll find the needle

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.189 align:middle line:84%
within your lifetime
might go up.

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Seth, tell
us about Frank Drake

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:33.659 align:middle line:90%
and the Drake equation.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Frank Drake,
he's an American astronomer.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.796 align:middle line:90%
He works at the SETI Institute.

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:38.464 align:middle line:84%
His office is down
the hall from mine.

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:41.034 align:middle line:84%
He's officially retired,
but Frank will never...

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:42.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He'll never retire...

00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:43.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: He's
never really retired,

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.871 align:middle line:84%
so he comes in a
couple of days a week.

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:47.974 align:middle line:84%
And he did the first
modern SETI experiment.

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:49.942 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't doing what
Marconi did, you know,

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:90%
listening to a.m. radio

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:84%
on his yacht somewhere
hoping to hear the Martians.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.815 align:middle line:84%
But, Frank realizes
that, you know,

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.016 align:middle line:84%
a.m. radio is really
not very good

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:58.418 align:middle line:84%
for communicating
with the stars.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.285 align:middle line:90%
It's too low frequency.

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:00.219 align:middle line:90%
That's a technical story.

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:01.421 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: But, what he
realizes that microwaves,

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:05.124 align:middle line:84%
which are, you know, the kind
of radio waves that are used

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:08.194 align:middle line:84%
for radar or for cooking up
turkey and stuff like that.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:13.266 align:middle line:84%
Microwaves actually are -- they
go right through the ionosphere.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:16.702 align:middle line:84%
The universe is very quiet at
that part of the dial, so, hey,

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.138 align:middle line:84%
if the aliens are really
trying to get in touch,

00:07:19.138 --> 00:07:22.108 align:middle line:84%
they might choose a range
of frequencies where it's...

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:22.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They would know that.

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: They
would know that.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.547 align:middle line:84%
So, he used an antenna in
West Virginia, not a huge one,

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:29.749 align:middle line:84%
it would, you know --
it's 80 feet in diameter.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:32.652 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would be
impressive in your backward.

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And he used it for a couple
of weeks and he pointed

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.455 align:middle line:90%
at a couple nearby stars

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.256 align:middle line:84%
and that was the first
modern SETI experiment.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:38.291 align:middle line:90%
Okay, he's famous for that.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.659 align:middle line:90%
He broke new ground.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:42.562 align:middle line:84%
But, what he also did was a
year later he had a conference

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:44.397 align:middle line:84%
about all this stuff
in that same place

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.466 align:middle line:90%
in West Virginia, 1961.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.769 align:middle line:84%
And he got together about
a dozen eminent astronomers

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:52.205 align:middle line:84%
and engineers and he
said, "Look, you know,

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:54.273 align:middle line:90%
let's talk about this.

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Does this make sense to try
and eavesdrop on the aliens?"

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.512 align:middle line:84%
And to organize a
meeting, as an agenda,

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.013 align:middle line:90%
he came up with this equation.

00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:01.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Aha!

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: So, that it was for.

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:05.785 align:middle line:84%
It's now known, of course,
as the Drake equation.

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:07.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Which is
a predictability

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:09.789 align:middle line:84%
of the possibility
of life out there?

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:11.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: It is.

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:12.492 align:middle line:84%
What it does is -- I mean,
these guys are sitting around,

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.093 align:middle line:84%
they say, "Well, of course,
you could spend a lot of time

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:17.096 align:middle line:84%
with these antennas
pointing them at the sky,

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:19.599 align:middle line:84%
but does that make any sense or
you're just wasting your time,

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:20.666 align:middle line:90%
and maybe a little bit of money.

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.567 align:middle line:84%
It was very little
money, but, you know,

00:08:22.567 --> 00:08:24.403 align:middle line:90%
wasting your time, that counts.

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:25.538 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Well, okay.

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:28.173 align:middle line:84%
What we want to know is,
how many societies are

00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:29.976 align:middle line:90%
out there in our galaxy?

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:32.044 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with our
galaxy, it's big enough.

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:35.081 align:middle line:84%
Right? In our galaxy, that
our broadcasting signals going

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:36.983 align:middle line:84%
through our bodies as
we sit here, right?

00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:39.886 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it's millions
or thousands.

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:41.554 align:middle line:84%
Okay, then it makes
sense to look.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.256 align:middle line:90%
If it's one or two,

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.191 align:middle line:84%
you're probably never
going to find them.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.526 align:middle line:84%
So, that's what the
Drake equation does.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.695 align:middle line:84%
It tries to estimate how many
broadcasting societies are

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.631 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And did it estimate

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:53.599 align:middle line:84%
that there are enough
to keep this going?

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:54.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Well, that's the --

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:58.437 align:middle line:84%
that's unfortunately the
bad news part of this.

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:02.208 align:middle line:84%
The good news is this equation
is really very useful in sort

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.676 align:middle line:90%
of structuring the conversation.

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:05.178 align:middle line:84%
But, what it does
is it says, "Look,

00:09:05.178 --> 00:09:06.879 align:middle line:84%
the number of broadcasting
societies depends

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.214 align:middle line:90%
on a couple of things.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.283 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, how many planets
are out there, for example,

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:11.484 align:middle line:84%
how many of them
have cooked up life?

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:14.053 align:middle line:84%
How many of those have
cooked up intelligent life

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:15.855 align:middle line:90%
and it's built a transmitter."

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:18.291 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond that, how
many of them are still around

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.927 align:middle line:84%
or do they all -- you
know, they invent radio

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:22.929 align:middle line:84%
and then they invent H-bombs
and then they go off the air.

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:24.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Exactly,
which happens.

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:27.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, I hope
not but it could happen.

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.835 align:middle line:90%
And so, there are a lot of terms

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.237 align:middle line:84%
in the equation that
we don't know.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.406 align:middle line:84%
So you can't really get -- you
can get any number out you want.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.541 align:middle line:90%
It's up to personal opinion.

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:36.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But was
Frank convinced

00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:39.912 align:middle line:84%
that there are many
intelligent societies out there?

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:42.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Frank himself will
tell you, you can go ask him.

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:45.084 align:middle line:84%
Frank, what's the bottom
line on your equation?

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:46.586 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, how
many societies are

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.687 align:middle line:90%
out there broadcasting?

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:49.989 align:middle line:84%
And he'll say in our
galaxy, I figure 10,000.

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it
worthwhile to look.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.024 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's interesting.

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:52.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:54.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It sure does.

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:55.461 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: But, he will also
admit that that's just his...

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:56.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Guess.

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:56.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Gut feeling.

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:57.964 align:middle line:90%
It's his guess.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Carl Sagan,
though, the late Carl Sagan,

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:04.403 align:middle line:84%
the great astronomer; he was a
believer that there are billions

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:08.341 align:middle line:84%
and billions of stars and
that there possibly could be

00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:09.842 align:middle line:90%
intelligent life out there.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:10.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah, he was.

00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:12.511 align:middle line:84%
His answer to this
-- now, mind you,

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:15.248 align:middle line:84%
this was before we had found,
you know, lots of planets

00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:17.817 align:middle line:84%
out there and so forth, but he
still said when he was asked,

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:20.319 align:middle line:84%
"How many broadcasting societies
do you think are out there?"

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:22.822 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say 10,000
[inaudible], he said, "Million."

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:24.223 align:middle line:90%
Or a couple of million.

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:27.827 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Now, what we know now and
that wasn't known at the time

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:84%
of Carl Sagan, right, is that
they're roughly a trillion --

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.866 align:middle line:84%
that's with a T. Trillion
planets in our galaxy alone.

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:35.034 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Could you
believe that?

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:35.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Trillion...

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:36.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:37.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah...

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:38.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And we only found
a couple of hundred, right?

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:39.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: We've
found maybe a thousand

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.641 align:middle line:90%
that are confirmed so far.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.075 align:middle line:90%
A trillion is a big number.

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:44.777 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a galaxy
of planets.

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.612 align:middle line:84%
It's not even a galaxy
of stars, right?

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:47.747 align:middle line:90%
A trillion.

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:49.282 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, not all
of them are worthwhile.

00:10:49.282 --> 00:10:51.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are going
to be worthless planets

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.485 align:middle line:90%
like Mercury or Neptune.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:54.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Right?

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:55.488 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even if one -- if
somebody gave you Neptune,

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.189 align:middle line:84%
I don't know you'd know
what to do with it.

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:59.825 align:middle line:84%
Right? But, if only
1% of them --

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.193 align:middle line:90%
and that might be a good number.

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:03.396 align:middle line:84%
1% of them have liquid oceans,
a little bit of atmosphere,

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:06.265 align:middle line:84%
you know, it might be as
habitable as, I don't know,

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:07.833 align:middle line:90%
downtown LA or something.

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:11.437 align:middle line:84%
If 1% of them, then
that's still 10 billion.

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:14.874 align:middle line:84%
So, when you have 10 billion
planets that could support life,

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:17.343 align:middle line:84%
you've got to really
believe in miracles to think

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.577 align:middle line:90%
that there isn't any life there.

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:20.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Years ago
Seth, you and I talked

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:21.847 align:middle line:90%
about the primordial soup

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:26.485 align:middle line:84%
in that it's the same
all over the universe.

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So, it's just a matter of time
that whatever mixed us together,

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.892 align:middle line:90%
it's happening someplace else.

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:34.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well,
it's certainly true.

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:35.528 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all these
planets are built

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:39.231 align:middle line:84%
out of the same stuff we've
got here right here on earth.

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:41.467 align:middle line:84%
Okay? And, you know,
they have stars.

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:43.536 align:middle line:84%
Their home suns are
sort of like the sun.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.005 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the environments
are pretty much the same.

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:48.641 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the 92 elements
you've learned about back

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:49.742 align:middle line:90%
in 10th grade, 11th grade,

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.711 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was,
they're everywhere.

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:52.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They're everywhere.

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:53.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: The farthest
galaxies,

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:54.714 align:middle line:90%
all made of the same stuff.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.683 align:middle line:84%
So, they've had the same
opportunity, equal opportunity.

00:11:57.683 --> 00:11:59.318 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it produced
equal outcomes though.

00:11:59.318 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Did it actually cook up life?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.389 align:middle line:84%
And that's a bit of a question
because you could say, "Look,

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.558 align:middle line:90%
maybe life is a very --

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:06.926 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you can have
a planet like Earth.

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:09.128 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a million
planets like Earth."

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
What fraction of them will
ever cook up something that's,

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.932 align:middle line:90%
you know, alive, reproducing

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:14.767 align:middle line:84%
and eventually might
become something nifty.

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:16.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:16.902 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And we don't know
the answer to that because,

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:90%
you know, we weren't here.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.572 align:middle line:90%
People work on that problem.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.006 align:middle line:84%
Most people are fairly
optimistic,

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:23.576 align:middle line:84%
if I give you a million
planets with the capability

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:24.944 align:middle line:84%
to spawn life, a
lot of them will.

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:26.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right, exactly.

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:30.249 align:middle line:84%
They always say if it has water,
if it's close to its star,

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:90%
something's going to happen.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.518 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:34.353 align:middle line:84%
You got a lot of chemistry
going and, you know,

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:37.456 align:middle line:84%
one way to approach that
question would be to make life

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:39.291 align:middle line:90%
in the lab like --

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:43.062 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Frankenstein but not
quite like that, right?

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:46.098 align:middle line:84%
But making some sort
of a bacterium

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:47.333 align:middle line:90%
or something in the lab.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.168 align:middle line:84%
And there are people,
there's a guy, Jack Szostak

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.603 align:middle line:90%
at Harvard University.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Any relation?

00:12:51.737 --> 00:12:53.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: I've asked
him a couple of times

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:55.074 align:middle line:84%
and he usually laughs and
says, "No, I don't think so."

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:58.477 align:middle line:84%
But, he won the Nobel Prize or
something and I asked him again.

00:12:58.477 --> 00:12:59.678 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You want
him to be a relation.

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, I'd
love him to be a relative

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.214 align:middle line:90%
but he's not, apparently.

00:13:02.214 --> 00:13:04.683 align:middle line:84%
In any case, so he's trying
to make life in the lab,

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:06.519 align:middle line:84%
but he doesn't it yet
but he figures, you know,

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:07.453 align:middle line:90%
he'll probably think...

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:08.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He thinks he will.

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:10.423 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: He thinks he's going
to do it and in short order.

00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:15.361 align:middle line:84%
So, I figure if this guy up
in Massachusetts can make life

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:19.165 align:middle line:84%
in the lab over the course of a
grant, you know, over the course

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:22.368 align:middle line:84%
of a few years, then the
earth could've cooked it

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:25.838 align:middle line:84%
up having the entire planet
as a lab and having hundreds

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:27.173 align:middle line:90%
of millions of years to do it.

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:28.474 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.109 align:middle line:84%
Well, and you look at all
the species on this planet.

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:31.377 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:33.913 align:middle line:90%
This is just unbelievable.

00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:35.848 align:middle line:90%
It's a zoo of creatures.

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:36.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: It is.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:37.783 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the diversity
is -- yeah.

00:13:37.783 --> 00:13:39.585 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting, too.

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And it also -- I think
it addresses the question

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.722 align:middle line:84%
that you get a lot,
you know, okay.

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:45.791 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you think ET's out
there, you might even find him.

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:47.493 align:middle line:84%
What is he going to
look like, right?

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:84%
In the movies, they look
kind of like us, less hair,

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:84%
gray complexions, big eyes,
small noses, small mouths,

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.534 align:middle line:90%
small bodies, all that stuff.

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:57.336 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of an
icon for the aliens.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:13:58.103 --> 00:13:59.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Right.

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.639 align:middle line:84%
But that's a shortcut
that's useful for Hollywood

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:02.107 align:middle line:84%
because now they don't have
to give you the back story

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:03.142 align:middle line:90%
about what this thing is.

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:03.843 align:middle line:90%
It's an alien.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:04.543 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, it's an alien.

00:14:04.543 --> 00:14:06.045 align:middle line:90%
It's like ghosts.

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:07.346 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:08.981 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, you just go
down to the zoo and you look

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:09.982 align:middle line:84%
at that diversity
and say, "You know,

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
designs that work.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.552 align:middle line:84%
They don't all have to look
like little gray guys."

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:14.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's all true.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:16.755 align:middle line:90%
We're 4.5 billion years old.

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:19.625 align:middle line:84%
The universe is about
14 billion years old.

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:23.629 align:middle line:84%
So, there's a nine-billion-year
head start that some

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:25.431 align:middle line:84%
of these star systems
have had on us.

00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:28.601 align:middle line:90%
Nine billion years.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:32.404 align:middle line:84%
Assuming they haven't
obliterated themselves,

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.574 align:middle line:84%
just give yourself a
million years ahead of us,

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:37.343 align:middle line:84%
what kind of technology
would they have?

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:38.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:39.845 align:middle line:84%
I think that's really
an important point.

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:42.548 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, it's certainly an
important point when, you know,

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:45.584 align:middle line:84%
the next time you go to a sci-fi
film at your local, you know,

00:14:45.584 --> 00:14:48.787 align:middle line:84%
multiplex and they have these
aliens coming in and trying

00:14:48.787 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
to -- you know, usually they
take on the US Air Force,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.291 align:middle line:84%
or the Navy, or something
like that.

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:53.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: And just think,

00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:55.694 align:middle line:84%
these guys clearly are
more advanced than we are

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:56.996 align:middle line:90%
because they came here.

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:59.164 align:middle line:84%
Right? So, the idea that
you could take them on

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:90%
and win as we always do...

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Surrender.

00:15:01.634 --> 00:15:02.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:03.869 align:middle line:84%
I think the best thing to
do is try to negotiate.

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: That's the deal.

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:08.474 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. But, your point is very
well taken that, you know,

00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:10.376 align:middle line:84%
most of the societies
of intelligent beings

00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:84%
out there are going
to be way ahead of us.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:12.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Way ahead.

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:13.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And they could
be billions of years.

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:16.582 align:middle line:84%
So, what are they
going to be like?

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:18.217 align:middle line:84%
Who knows, I mean,
that's like asking,

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:20.519 align:middle line:84%
I don't trilobites [inaudible]
what do you think living things

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:21.887 align:middle line:84%
will be like in the
21st century.

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:23.188 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I mean, I
try to speculate, Seth,

00:15:23.188 --> 00:15:26.926 align:middle line:84%
on what a 100 years here
will be like in the future,

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.294 align:middle line:90%
let alone, a billion years.

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:29.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:30.629 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very hard
and it's probably --

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:31.597 align:middle line:84%
I mean, [inaudible] you
think I was probably wrong,

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.632 align:middle line:90%
but there is this.

00:15:33.632 --> 00:15:35.868 align:middle line:84%
What's happening in the 21st
century which is different

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.136 align:middle line:90%
than previous centuries is

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:39.972 align:middle line:84%
that we may be engineering
our own successors, right?

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:42.441 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of people are
uncomfortable with the idea

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:43.742 align:middle line:90%
of artificial intelligence...

00:15:43.742 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.312 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: ...a machine
that, I don't know, you know,

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:47.947 align:middle line:84%
what I mean, you know, write
the "Great American Novel"

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.515 align:middle line:90%
or teach college chemistry.

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:50.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Have an emotion.

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:52.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah,
anything like that.

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:53.786 align:middle line:90%
They don't like that idea.

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:57.222 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, if
you talk to people who work

00:15:57.222 --> 00:15:59.758 align:middle line:84%
in this field and you just ask
them point blank, "Are we going

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:03.195 align:middle line:84%
to make a thinking machine
before 2050," or maybe 2100

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:04.229 align:middle line:90%
if you're pessimistic.

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:06.098 align:middle line:90%
And they don't say "No."

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:06.732 align:middle line:90%
They'll say "Yes."

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Now,
they could be wrong.

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:09.468 align:middle line:90%
They could be wrong.

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.303 align:middle line:84%
But maybe we don't do
it by 2050 or 2100,

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:12.471 align:middle line:90%
but it takes another years.

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:13.305 align:middle line:90%
It really doesn't matter.

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:14.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And then maybe sooner.

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:15.407 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:16.709 align:middle line:84%
The point is, it's very
short period of time.

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:18.611 align:middle line:84%
You invent radio and then
you invent your successors.

00:16:18.611 --> 00:16:19.878 align:middle line:84%
So, if you're thinking
about aliens

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:22.748 align:middle line:84%
that are a million years
ahead of us, or 100,000 years

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:25.851 align:middle line:84%
or even 1000 years ahead of
us, my guess is there's going

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:27.786 align:middle line:84%
to be some sort of
synthetic intelligence,

00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:29.188 align:middle line:90%
just not [inaudible].

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You know, I look at,
for example, we got to the moon

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:37.196 align:middle line:84%
in 1969 and we're the only
ones to get to the moon.

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:39.665 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we're looking at
these other countries now,

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.467 align:middle line:90%
India, China, Japan.

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:42.635 align:middle line:90%
They're all launching missile.

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:45.304 align:middle line:84%
They're all got great
technology.

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:47.139 align:middle line:90%
So, they're moving ahead.

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:52.745 align:middle line:84%
But, just on this little
planet, we were 47 years ahead

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:55.214 align:middle line:84%
of them basically in
terms of technology.

00:16:55.214 --> 00:16:56.748 align:middle line:90%
That's nothing.

00:16:56.748 --> 00:16:57.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:58.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And that's
on this planet.

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:00.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Oh, exactly.

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:02.388 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, you can
take the case of it.

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:04.023 align:middle line:84%
I mean, consider the
Native Americans,

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.391 align:middle line:90%
for example, the Aztecs, right?

00:17:06.391 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Pizarro trots in, you know,
meets the, you know, chief Inca

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.233 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, right,
1530, whatever it was.

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:17.836 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, they
get into a skirmish,

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:19.938 align:middle line:84%
those guys never
had a chance, right?

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:21.607 align:middle line:84%
It's not that there were
an awful lot of Spanish.

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:24.009 align:middle line:84%
There were very few actually,
but they had, you know,

00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:27.279 align:middle line:84%
these cruddy guns, these
blunderbusses and that --

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:28.514 align:middle line:90%
so that's all it took.

00:17:28.514 --> 00:17:30.716 align:middle line:84%
They were -- the people
estimated how far ahead were

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:84%
these Europeans, you
know, ahead of the Incas,

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.654 align:middle line:84%
and maybe a couple
of hundred years.

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:36.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's all.

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:36.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: That's all.

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:38.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:39.425 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And that
made all the difference.

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:41.927 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, when you watch the
aliens take on the US military

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and win, you got to say,
"You know, Bob, I don't know

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.331 align:middle line:90%
that it would happen that way.

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:48.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: As long as they're
not eating us [laughter],

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:49.134 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want.

00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:50.536 align:middle line:84%
Let's take one of
our phone calls.

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:53.472 align:middle line:84%
We've got Seth Shostak here, of
course, from the SETI Institute.

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:55.174 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:58.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, Seth, this is
Sandra, and I'm wondering

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:84%
if you think disclosure
is close.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now, disclosure,
of course,

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:05.651 align:middle line:84%
means the extraterrestrial
presence,

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:08.887 align:middle line:84%
which you don't believe
is here yet,

00:18:08.887 --> 00:18:10.255 align:middle line:90%
knowing you for all these years.

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yes.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.491 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm somewhat skeptical...

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I'm not putting words
in your mouth, but I know you.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yes, and I know
something about the disclosure,

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:84%
because of course, I
read about it, too.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.299 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a lot of people think
that the aliens are not only

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:21.433 align:middle line:90%
out there, but they're here,

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.502 align:middle line:84%
and that the government
is keeping information

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that would prove
that unequivocally

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.307 align:middle line:84%
and they should come clean
and just admit it, disclosure.

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:32.711 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's anything
to disclose, personally,

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:35.414 align:middle line:84%
but when I ask people, why would
the government be keeping it

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:36.648 align:middle line:90%
quiet in the first place?

00:18:36.648 --> 00:18:40.652 align:middle line:84%
Why is it being closed
instead of disclosed?

00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:44.623 align:middle line:84%
They usually tell me because the
government figures the public

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:45.758 align:middle line:90%
couldn't handle the news.

00:18:45.758 --> 00:18:46.892 align:middle line:90%
They'd just go nuts.

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:49.628 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, this is
the 75th anniversary

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:90%
of Orson Welles' broadcast...

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:51.964 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: "War of the Worlds."

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: "War of the Worlds,"

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.467 align:middle line:84%
and there's this popular
perception that the, you know,

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:58.203 align:middle line:84%
the public went nuts, at least
those who could listen to --

00:18:58.203 --> 00:18:59.338 align:middle line:90%
I guess, it was the CBS...

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:00.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: CBS...

00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: CBS broadcast.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.143 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Actually, if you talked
to people who have looked

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.644 align:middle line:84%
into this -- there
have been recent books

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:08.113 align:middle line:84%
about this -- they
didn't go nuts.

00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:11.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was an extra
phone activity in New York

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.851 align:middle line:84%
and so but people might have
been calling their friends

00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:14.353 align:middle line:84%
and saying, "Hey, this
is a really neat show.

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:15.487 align:middle line:90%
Listen to it."

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:17.723 align:middle line:84%
you know. People didn't
go -- nobody was killed.

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:20.292 align:middle line:84%
There was a photo in Life
Magazine of some farmer

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.760 align:middle line:84%
with a gun protecting
his property...

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Just in case.

00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:23.796 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah,
but that was staged

00:19:23.796 --> 00:19:26.031 align:middle line:90%
by Life Magazine [inaudible].

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:29.668 align:middle line:84%
So, but I think that the reason
that this is important is

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:33.806 align:middle line:84%
that it -- I think it set
the tone for this argument

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:36.475 align:middle line:84%
that the public would not
be told in case we were

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:40.179 align:middle line:84%
to find a signal or there were
aliens buzzing the countryside.

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:41.513 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:43.782 align:middle line:84%
Well, and you know, I have
gotten calls on coast to coast

00:19:43.782 --> 00:19:47.953 align:middle line:84%
from people who have
said, "SETI has signals.

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:49.922 align:middle line:90%
They know but they're being told

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:52.658 align:middle line:84%
by government not to
release anything."

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:56.295 align:middle line:84%
And I go on the air and I
say, "I know Seth Shostak

00:19:56.295 --> 00:20:00.098 align:middle line:84%
and he would tell me if they
picked up a great signal."

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:02.534 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
leave it with them.

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:03.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Let me just point

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:05.037 align:middle line:84%
out something that's
pretty obvious to those

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.572 align:middle line:90%
of us who work in SETI.

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, we've
had some false alarms.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes, you have.

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:10.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And, you know,
there's no secrecy there.

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:12.744 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the New York Times
starts calling us up.

00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:15.714 align:middle line:84%
So, the media are on
these stories right away.

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.483 align:middle line:90%
But beyond that -- beyond

00:20:17.483 --> 00:20:23.055 align:middle line:84%
that nothing would improve our
financial circumstances faster

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.624 align:middle line:84%
than let's say, "Look, we
seem to have found something."

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:26.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:27.593 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Right?

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:29.294 align:middle line:84%
The temptation is to call
one of these false alarms,

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:31.296 align:middle line:84%
something interesting and
we try not to do that.

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:34.299 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, SETI is all
privately funded in this country

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:36.902 align:middle line:84%
and that means there's
very, very little money.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.338 align:middle line:84%
We can barely do the experiments
with so little money.

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:40.539 align:middle line:90%
So, if you could find something,

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:41.773 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you'd
keep it a secret.

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
My gosh, you would tell
everybody to get more money

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.745 align:middle line:84%
and then you could book
a flight to Stockholm

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:47.646 align:middle line:90%
and collect your check...

00:20:47.646 --> 00:20:48.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Get it, absolutely.

00:20:48.847 --> 00:20:49.615 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: ...and
get that prize.

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:50.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: [Inaudible].

00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:51.917 align:middle line:90%
Now, but here you are though.

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.887 align:middle line:84%
You are a believer in
extraterrestrial life

00:20:54.887 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
out there somewhere because
you're searching for it.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Exactly.

00:20:59.124 --> 00:21:03.228 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And you agree
that they could be billions

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:06.932 align:middle line:84%
of years ahead of us in terms
of knowledge and technology.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Why is it difficult for you
to comprehend or to believe

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:12.938 align:middle line:90%
that they're coming here?

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:13.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:15.207 align:middle line:84%
Look, it doesn't
violate physics.

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:16.408 align:middle line:90%
It isn't that you could say,

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:18.110 align:middle line:84%
there's just no way
they could get here.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.346 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as we can say
about this, and, you know,

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:23.081 align:middle line:84%
our physics, of course,
is incomplete.

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:25.884 align:middle line:84%
You know, the story could
change, but, you know,

00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:28.587 align:middle line:84%
Einstein seems to be right
about certain things, namely,

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:30.422 align:middle line:84%
that you can't send
a rocket ship faster

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.425 align:middle line:84%
And to get close to the speed
light takes a lot of energy,

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.993 align:middle line:90%
an enormous amount of energy.

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:36.461 align:middle line:90%
Okay? And so, you know,

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:38.931 align:middle line:84%
there are all these
practical impediments.

00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:39.965 align:middle line:90%
Okay? So, that's one thing.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.566 align:middle line:84%
You could make the
argument, you know.

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:43.135 align:middle line:84%
It's so expensive for
them to come here.

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:44.236 align:middle line:90%
Why would they bother?

00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:46.104 align:middle line:84%
They can just watch
our television, right?

00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:49.274 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is,
why are they here now?

00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:51.576 align:middle line:84%
I ask people who think
that the aliens are here.

00:21:51.576 --> 00:21:52.878 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:21:52.878 --> 00:21:55.347 align:middle line:84%
Just in time to improve your
social life by hauling you

00:21:55.347 --> 00:21:57.049 align:middle line:84%
out of your bedroom
for these experiments.

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:59.251 align:middle line:84%
Right? And their
response to that is, well,

00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:01.353 align:middle line:84%
they don't like what we're doing
to the environment or they don't

00:22:01.353 --> 00:22:03.455 align:middle line:84%
like the fact we have
nuclear weapon or something.

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:05.223 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
about any of that

00:22:05.223 --> 00:22:07.092 align:middle line:84%
because that's on
the nightly news.

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:08.994 align:middle line:84%
But the nightly news
hasn't gotten anywhere close

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:09.828 align:middle line:90%
to them yet.

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:11.229 align:middle line:90%
They're too far away for that.

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:14.199 align:middle line:84%
So, the fact that they're here
now is an enormous coincidence.

00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:15.434 align:middle line:84%
It's like you buy
one lottery ticket

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.769 align:middle line:84%
and you win the Powerball
jackpot.

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:20.806 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it could happen but
it does seem a little bizarre.

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:24.509 align:middle line:84%
But, the real bottom line
is this -- if they're here,

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:26.712 align:middle line:84%
the evidence to me, I
think would be good.

00:22:26.712 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't be bad.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.482 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands and
thousands of reports of UFOs.

00:22:30.482 --> 00:22:32.651 align:middle line:84%
Every day I get people
calling me up.

00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:33.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: By good witnesses.

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, all of
these witnesses are not lying.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.288 align:middle line:90%
They're not making it up.

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:37.322 align:middle line:90%
None of them wants to call me.

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:38.457 align:middle line:90%
I can tell.

00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:39.558 align:middle line:90%
They're sincere people.

00:22:39.558 --> 00:22:41.426 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to pilots
and all that stuff.

00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:43.028 align:middle line:90%
Right? They've seen something.

00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:90%
That's not the issue.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But, what they've seen is
the issue because, you know,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.202 align:middle line:84%
if thousands of thousands
of reports,

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:53.105 align:middle line:84%
we still don't have evidence
that convinces, for example.

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:54.873 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you don't think
I would be convinced,

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:56.241 align:middle line:90%
but maybe the curators

00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:59.177 align:middle line:84%
of the Smithsonian Institute
[inaudible] institution,

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:01.179 align:middle line:84%
would be convinced
and put up a display,

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:03.448 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't convince
them either.

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:05.317 align:middle line:84%
So, I think that that
actually is important

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:08.787 align:middle line:84%
that every year there are 10,000
or more sightings and yet none

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:10.689 align:middle line:84%
of them makes it into
the science museums.

00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:12.858 align:middle line:84%
This is not a conspiracy
of the science museums.

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:14.693 align:middle line:90%
They get a lot of ticket sales.

00:23:14.693 --> 00:23:19.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Give us the what-if,
the what if you get that signal

00:23:19.364 --> 00:23:23.201 align:middle line:84%
that you've been looking
for and listening for.

00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:24.836 align:middle line:90%
How would it come?

00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:26.505 align:middle line:90%
How would you announce it?

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:27.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:29.741 align:middle line:84%
We sit around occasionally and
think about that because...

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:30.909 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You've got a protocol.

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well,
there is a protocol.

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.246 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was head of
the committee that was --

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That created
the protocol.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, we
revamped that protocol, yeah,

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:40.552 align:middle line:84%
and we also created part -- some
of us were involved [inaudible].

00:23:40.552 --> 00:23:42.554 align:middle line:84%
But, it's really -- I mean,
you can find on the web,

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:43.922 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing secret
about this,

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:46.224 align:middle line:84%
but it's a really simple thing
and it has no force of law.

00:23:46.224 --> 00:23:47.626 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem.

00:23:47.626 --> 00:23:50.328 align:middle line:84%
But all it says is if you find a
signal, you know, check it out.

00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:51.663 align:middle line:90%
Don't cry wolf.

00:23:51.663 --> 00:23:53.231 align:middle line:84%
Don't say, "Hey, we found
[inaudible] oh, the next day,

00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:55.767 align:middle line:84%
"Sorry, it was a radar
down at the local airbase."

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:57.002 align:middle line:90%
Check it out, okay?

00:23:57.002 --> 00:23:57.669 align:middle line:90%
That's obvious.

00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:59.004 align:middle line:90%
Two, tell everybody.

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:00.739 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of people don't
believe that would happen

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:02.507 align:middle line:84%
but I'm here to tell
you, it would happen.

00:24:02.507 --> 00:24:04.509 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
is, don't respond

00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:06.645 align:middle line:84%
without international
consultation.

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:07.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:09.314 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: That's the only
thing that's controversial.

00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But, that was put in back in
the days of the Soviet Union

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.619 align:middle line:84%
where the US and Soviets were
both conducting SETI experiments

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:17.355 align:middle line:84%
and there was this distrust
and it was this fear

00:24:17.355 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:84%
that if somebody
picked up a signal,

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.891 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't tell anybody

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:22.561 align:middle line:84%
and that it would start a
conversation with these guys

00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:24.463 align:middle line:84%
that make a whole lot of
sense to me, but, you know.

00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:26.364 align:middle line:90%
So that's why they put that in.

00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:27.699 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it says.

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:30.368 align:middle line:84%
But we do know what would
happen, it would be a big story.

00:24:30.368 --> 00:24:31.069 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Huge.

00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Huge.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:32.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Worldwide.

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:33.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:34.673 align:middle line:90%
I mean, people...

00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:36.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Maybe one of
the greatest stories ever.

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:38.744 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: I once told a whole
bunch of science journalists

00:24:38.744 --> 00:24:41.012 align:middle line:84%
to say, "You know, how would
you rank a story like that,

00:24:41.012 --> 00:24:42.681 align:middle line:84%
you know, if we detected
a signal?

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:44.216 align:middle line:84%
And every single one
of them wrote back,

00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:45.217 align:middle line:90%
"Biggest story ever!"

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:46.985 align:middle line:84%
Except one guy who
said, "Number two

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to the assassination
of Kennedy."

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.089 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I would
agree with that.

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's just remarkable.

00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:54.392 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Would you be able

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.697 align:middle line:84%
to say what you would
uncover, how you would do it?

00:24:58.697 --> 00:24:59.831 align:middle line:90%
But it would be one

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
of the world's greatest
stories, I think, ever.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.101 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: It would
get more interesting

00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:04.302 align:middle line:90%
if you can understand anything.

00:25:04.302 --> 00:25:05.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Would this --

00:25:05.604 --> 00:25:08.573 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say would the
signal come in as a voice,

00:25:08.573 --> 00:25:10.509 align:middle line:90%
whatever their voice might be?

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:14.613 align:middle line:84%
Or, would it come
in as code, blips?

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:15.881 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:17.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, I mean,
of course, you don't know,

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:20.886 align:middle line:84%
to the extent that they move
beyond biological intelligence.

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:23.922 align:middle line:84%
They're not some sort of
protoplasmic, you know,

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:27.659 align:middle line:84%
brain-carrying critter, but
there's some sort of machinery.

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:29.461 align:middle line:84%
Then they might not
even have a voice,

00:25:29.461 --> 00:25:30.896 align:middle line:84%
that might not a way
they communicate.

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:33.265 align:middle line:84%
They'll just send you
a whole bunch of bits.

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:35.033 align:middle line:84%
And people have thought about,
"Well, now wait a minute,

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.802 align:middle line:84%
how are we ever going to
understand those bits?"

00:25:36.802 --> 00:25:39.271 align:middle line:84%
And I think the answer is you
might never understand them.

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:42.440 align:middle line:84%
But if they said a lot of
stuff, then you have a chance.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.643 align:middle line:84%
It's like the Egyptian
hieroglyphics, right?

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:46.044 align:middle line:90%
Those were decoded.

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:49.147 align:middle line:84%
Some of the Mayan codices, we
don't really understand so well.

00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But the hieroglyphics
we do, and why is that?

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.186 align:middle line:90%
Well, a lot of the reason is,

00:25:54.186 --> 00:25:56.321 align:middle line:84%
there are many, many
examples of it.

00:25:56.321 --> 00:25:58.123 align:middle line:84%
You know, Egypt is
a dry country.

00:25:58.123 --> 00:25:59.291 align:middle line:90%
These things are well preserved.

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:01.059 align:middle line:84%
There's just walls and
walls of this stuff

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.127 align:middle line:90%
and when you have a lot of it,

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:04.262 align:middle line:84%
then you can get
somewhere in the decoding.

00:26:04.262 --> 00:26:05.931 align:middle line:84%
I think that if they sent
us a whole bunch of bits

00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:09.167 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted us to
understand, then they would,

00:26:09.167 --> 00:26:10.669 align:middle line:84%
you know, maybe send
a picture dictionary,

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:90%
you know, here's our planet.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:12.637 --> 00:26:13.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: [Inaudible]
planet, whatever.

00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:14.539 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that might work.

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:15.874 align:middle line:90%
But, on the other hand,

00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's a transmission
wasn't really intended for us

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.444 align:middle line:90%
and we never understand.

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:20.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It could be
a blanket transmission.

00:26:20.812 --> 00:26:22.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: It could be, you
know, the local weather report.

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:22.981 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:24.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:26:24.216 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's take another question
for you, Seth Shostak

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.085 align:middle line:90%
from the SETI Institute.

00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:28.286 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:29.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Seth.

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:33.024 align:middle line:84%
My name is Raquel [assumed
spelling] and I'd like to know

00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:39.064 align:middle line:84%
at what age you decided that you
wanted to become an astronomer.

00:26:39.064 --> 00:26:40.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah [laughter].

00:26:40.298 --> 00:26:41.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Junior astronomer.

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:42.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah, you know,

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
that's a very tantalizing
question, I would say.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:50.909 align:middle line:84%
Well, look, you know, when I was
a kid, my parents would send me

00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:53.278 align:middle line:84%
to the local -- well, when
I would go to New York

00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:54.746 align:middle line:84%
to visit my relatives,
they would send me

00:26:54.746 --> 00:26:56.181 align:middle line:84%
to the old Hayden
Planetarium in New York

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:57.382 align:middle line:90%
and I always think that was a...

00:26:57.382 --> 00:26:58.149 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And you loved it?

00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: I really did.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You loved it.

00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:01.453 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And I built a
telescope at age 10 and,

00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:03.255 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was trying to make
time-lapse movies of the moons

00:27:03.255 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:90%
of Jupiter by age 11 [laughter].

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.026 align:middle line:84%
So, I suppose -- you know,
I may be wrong about this,

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:11.229 align:middle line:84%
but my impression is that
kids get interested in things

00:27:11.229 --> 00:27:12.998 align:middle line:90%
between the ages of 8 and 11,

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:14.966 align:middle line:84%
and whatever interest
they developed in,

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.134 align:middle line:84%
they keep with them
for their lives.

00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:17.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Absolutely.

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:19.437 align:middle line:84%
I was in the junior
astronomy club.

00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:20.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Were you?

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:21.072 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Loved it.

00:27:21.072 --> 00:27:23.475 align:middle line:84%
My dad bought me
my first telescope.

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:26.211 align:middle line:84%
The thing I will
always remember, Seth,

00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:29.848 align:middle line:84%
looking at the rings of
Saturn through a telescope

00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:34.552 align:middle line:84%
as a young boy, 12, 13 years
old; absolutely unbelievable.

00:27:34.552 --> 00:27:38.723 align:middle line:84%
It was as if God painted
a picture in the sky.

00:27:38.723 --> 00:27:41.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, you know, I
hear that from a lot of people

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:42.794 align:middle line:84%
that it was that
first look at Saturn.

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:45.664 align:middle line:84%
I guess we should be grateful
that Saturn's ring system,

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:46.798 align:middle line:84%
you know, a lot of us
[multiple speakers].

00:27:46.798 --> 00:27:48.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Yeah, because
it's just so strange.

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:52.137 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: It's so spectacular
and if that hadn't be the case,

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:54.773 align:middle line:84%
you know, if that -- you
know, Saturn's rings were

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:55.874 align:middle line:90%
like Jupiter's rings,

00:27:55.874 --> 00:27:57.075 align:middle line:84%
so you really couldn't
see them very well.

00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:58.076 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:27:58.076 --> 00:27:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: If they'd
been like that,

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.011 align:middle line:84%
maybe astronomy wouldn't
be where it is today...

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:01.279 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That could be.

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: ...like you
hadn't all those astronomers.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:02.781 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's gorgeous.

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:03.915 align:middle line:90%
And then Jupiter, of course,

00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:06.851 align:middle line:84%
seen their four large
moons hanging around;

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:08.320 align:middle line:90%
that was also a great sight.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yep,
for Galileo, too.

00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:11.323 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yep.

00:28:11.323 --> 00:28:14.059 align:middle line:84%
It's just -- it's the marvels
of the industry and the world.

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:16.828 align:middle line:90%
Where's our future headed?

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:19.197 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, I don't
know whether you care

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:20.432 align:middle line:90%
about which future here.

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:23.001 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can tell you, the
things I think are going

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:25.370 align:middle line:84%
to be important in terms of
the 21st century, both in terms

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.672 align:middle line:84%
of life and space,
but just in general.

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're doing
different things.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.408 align:middle line:90%
I think every century, you know,

00:28:30.408 --> 00:28:33.345 align:middle line:84%
the people entering a new
century say, "Well, you know,

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:35.347 align:middle line:84%
Ralph, this is a special
century [multiple speakers].

00:28:35.347 --> 00:28:36.181 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: This is it.

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:37.182 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah, this is it.

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:39.584 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, if
it was not 2000 --

00:28:39.584 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:84%
year 2000, but it was the
year 1000, you'd probably say,

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.589 align:middle line:84%
"This is a special century
because we've got special things

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:47.092 align:middle line:84%
like jousting and the black
plague, or, I don't know,

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:49.027 align:middle line:84%
whatever they thought
was special.

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:51.863 align:middle line:84%
And we probably have that,
too, but there are things

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:53.365 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
that are different.

00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:54.532 align:middle line:90%
To begin with,

00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:56.835 align:middle line:84%
we're understanding
biology in this century...

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Dramatically fast.

00:28:58.236 --> 00:29:00.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: ...and that's going
to change everything because,

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:02.240 align:middle line:84%
you know, we've designed
our babies, curing diseases,

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:84%
all these things are sort of out
there, there's possibilities.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.114 align:middle line:84%
The second things is,
I think we find life

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:10.615 align:middle line:90%
in space, I think, you know.

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And nobody can be sure,
but I think we'll find...

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.918 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The kind of
life you're looking for?

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:16.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, even that,
but certainly biology, I mean.

00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:18.356 align:middle line:84%
But, bacteria, you can
live on a lot of worlds

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:19.557 align:middle line:90%
where we couldn't but...

00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:21.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I just don't
think of bacteria as life.

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah,
well, I mean...

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You know, it
just doesn't do it for me.

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:25.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, it's not much
[inaudible] life, I suppose...

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:25.997 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No.

00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:27.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: ...but
yes [laughter].

00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:29.868 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, so that's interesting
because that'll calibrate us,

00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:30.969 align:middle line:90%
even if we don't learn anything

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:33.505 align:middle line:84%
from them except
that they're there.

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:35.707 align:middle line:84%
Well, that tells you, okay,
well, Earth is special

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:37.642 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a miracle
because this is happening all

00:29:37.642 --> 00:29:39.310 align:middle line:84%
over the place and, you
know, life may be as common

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.614 align:middle line:90%
as cheap motels or something.

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:46.718 align:middle line:84%
The third thing is we're going
to move into space a little bit,

00:29:46.718 --> 00:29:49.587 align:middle line:84%
probably not very much but,
you know, maybe a colony

00:29:49.587 --> 00:29:52.157 align:middle line:90%
on Mars or maybe on the moon.

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:54.592 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a college
professor who was arguing

00:29:54.592 --> 00:29:58.596 align:middle line:84%
that we should build giant
rotating aluminum cans in space.

00:29:58.596 --> 00:30:01.833 align:middle line:84%
He was predicting by the 1990s,
there would be tens of millions

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:03.034 align:middle line:84%
of people living in
these rotating...

00:30:03.034 --> 00:30:03.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: In these cans?

00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:05.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And people, I don't want to
live in a rotating can, but...

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: For the
rest of your...

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:08.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: No flies,
I mean, it might be...

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:08.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: No flies,
that's right.

00:30:08.873 --> 00:30:10.208 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: ...okay.

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, once you do
that, I think it's really hard

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.513 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of all humans
because we're kind of spread

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:17.816 align:middle line:84%
out a little bit, so, you know,
that might be a good thing.

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:21.419 align:middle line:84%
The fourth thing and this may
be the most important thing is

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:23.788 align:middle line:84%
when we talked about here
and that is the development

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:24.923 align:middle line:90%
of artificial intelligence.

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:25.757 align:middle line:90%
That could change everything.

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:26.724 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Which will be huge.

00:30:26.724 --> 00:30:27.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:28.326 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Huge.

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:29.727 align:middle line:84%
Let's take one more
question for Seth.

00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:30.261 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:30:30.261 --> 00:30:31.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Seth.

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:35.567 align:middle line:84%
I'm Monica from Ohio and I was
wondering if you ever see a time

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:39.971 align:middle line:84%
where we will be able to visit
planets like Saturn and Pluto.

00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:41.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That one, I guess
she means with people...

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.141 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: I assume.

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:43.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: ...astronauts.

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:45.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: We've visited...

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:47.178 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why would we want
to go there as an astronaut?

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, you know,
that's actually a good question,

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.850 align:middle line:84%
you know, because now, I
mean, our probe technology,

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.153 align:middle line:84%
if you will, is advancing
much more rapidly

00:30:55.153 --> 00:30:56.488 align:middle line:90%
than our rocket technology.

00:30:56.488 --> 00:30:57.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:30:57.822 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: So, instead of
actually going to Pluto, which,

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.825 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's going
to be cold and nowhere.

00:31:00.825 --> 00:31:01.893 align:middle line:84%
And so, well, it's going
to be tough to keep...

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:02.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And boring.

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:04.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, I
don't know how boring.

00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:06.831 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're a planetary
geologist you might say this is

00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:07.866 align:middle line:90%
really the...

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Yeah, but
how do I get back?

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, and then
you have to come back, right?

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:13.238 align:middle line:84%
If you send a probe, it
doesn't insist on coming back.

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:14.906 align:middle line:84%
There a lot of advances
to probes.

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:16.574 align:middle line:90%
But, could you do it?

00:31:16.574 --> 00:31:17.709 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you could do it.

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:20.778 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I mean, if it
became, I don't know,

00:31:20.778 --> 00:31:23.615 align:middle line:84%
a national priority
to put people on Mars

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:26.784 align:middle line:84%
in the next five years, if that
suddenly was the most important

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:27.619 align:middle line:90%
thing that we're doing...

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:28.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: We could do that.

00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:29.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: We could do that.

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:30.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: We could do that.

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Pluto's harder,
but, you know, you could do it.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.992 align:middle line:84%
But I think that what will
happen is that probes will

00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:36.227 align:middle line:84%
so overtake us in terms
of its capability.

00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:40.231 align:middle line:84%
Just send a probe to Pluto, you
know, like those Google cars

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:42.534 align:middle line:84%
that go around with all the
cameras and map everything.

00:31:42.534 --> 00:31:46.437 align:middle line:84%
Right? Send all those data back
and now you sit in a convenience

00:31:46.437 --> 00:31:49.073 align:middle line:84%
and the comfort of your own
living room with a joystick

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:50.742 align:middle line:84%
and a screen, and now
you can go to Pluto

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:53.444 align:middle line:84%
without having to
worry about air.

00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:55.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Are you baffled

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:57.749 align:middle line:84%
that we really never
went back to the moon?

00:31:57.749 --> 00:32:02.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, I don't know,
baffled; disappointed for sure.

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:05.823 align:middle line:84%
I think what happened at the end
of the Apollo program, you know,

00:32:05.823 --> 00:32:07.492 align:middle line:84%
people thought this is just
the first step and we're

00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:08.293 align:middle line:90%
about to take the step...

00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: We're ready to go.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.261 align:middle line:90%
We had momentum.

00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:11.796 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: We were going to go
to Mars next and all the stuff.

00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:13.131 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't happen.

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:14.899 align:middle line:84%
I think that the American
public for some reason thought,

00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:17.869 align:middle line:84%
"You know, we've got other
priorities and we've done that

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:20.605 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of it was
done for considerations

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:21.606 align:middle line:90%
of rising out of the Cold War.

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.309 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: So, we don't
have that and so are we.

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, they do that,
actually, but,

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.946 align:middle line:90%
you know, we won that round.

00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:29.647 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to keep playing.

00:32:29.647 --> 00:32:32.383 align:middle line:84%
And, so that was, you
know, disappointing.

00:32:32.383 --> 00:32:36.821 align:middle line:84%
>> Norry: Had we continued,
would the pace of our knowledge

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:39.958 align:middle line:84%
in space have increased,
or would it still be

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.159 align:middle line:90%
where it is right now?

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:42.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: No, I think
that you could safely say

00:32:42.527 --> 00:32:44.228 align:middle line:90%
that we would've learned more.

00:32:44.228 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that kind of thing...

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.097 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I mean, we
would've been on Mars

00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:47.332 align:middle line:90%
by now, there's no doubt.

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:48.399 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yes, we could've --

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:49.701 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to go to
Mars, actually.

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:84%
People forget that Mars is,
what is it, three times --

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.273 align:middle line:84%
it's, you know, like 140, 150
times farther than the moon.

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:56.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:32:56.608 --> 00:32:57.742 align:middle line:84%
But, I think technology would've
gotten better and better,

00:32:57.742 --> 00:32:59.444 align:middle line:84%
maybe better than it is
now [background talking]

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:00.645 align:middle line:90%
like knowledge.

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:02.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, our
rockets today are not all

00:33:02.547 --> 00:33:03.848 align:middle line:84%
that much better than
those Saturn V's...

00:33:03.848 --> 00:33:04.983 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:05.817 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: ...they were
using to go to the moon.

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.018 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah, that would've helped.

00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:08.486 align:middle line:84%
Or, even if you could
just went back to the moon

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:12.223 align:middle line:84%
and you put some telescopes,
you know, on it and particularly

00:33:12.223 --> 00:33:14.959 align:middle line:84%
on the backside where you shield
it from all this interference

00:33:14.959 --> 00:33:17.395 align:middle line:84%
on earth or radio telescopes,
that would be important.

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:18.796 align:middle line:90%
But, you know, that would be --

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:21.232 align:middle line:84%
you'd learn all sorts
of things by doing that.

00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:22.667 align:middle line:84%
We can learn more about
[multiple speakers] the moon.

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:23.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: [Background
talking] The Big Bang.

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:25.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Well, yeah,

00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:27.105 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] the Big Bang
is hard -- but yeah.

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:28.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Let's talk a
little bit about that.

00:33:28.272 --> 00:33:30.041 align:middle line:84%
We've got another
episode to go with you.

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:32.043 align:middle line:90%
Seth Shostak with us.

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:34.278 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
Beyond Belief.
