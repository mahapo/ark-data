I'm George Noory

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.629 align:middle line:90%
and welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.832 align:middle line:84%
Just how well do you take
care of your own health?

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.301 align:middle line:84%
Our next guest is an
expert on doing that.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.169 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.337 align:middle line:90%
>>Dr. Joel Wallach:

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.739 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical
industry drives things.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.308 align:middle line:84%
You see, there's no law
requiring doctors to cure people

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:44.744 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cure available.

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no law requiring doctors
to prevent diseases in people

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.082 align:middle line:90%
and the prevention is known.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:53.219 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it were my way, if I
were the US Surgeon General,

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.623 align:middle line:84%
the first thing I
would do is pass a law.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.858 align:middle line:84%
You see, as this agency,
they can make a law.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.927 align:middle line:84%
They don't even need to go to
Congress and get it approved.

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:01.995 align:middle line:90%
They can just make a law.

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would make a law
by fiat, I would make a law

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:84%
that said that if there is
a disease that is curable

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.972 align:middle line:84%
with anything, whether it's an
herb or a drug or a nutrient,

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.775 align:middle line:84%
if it's curable and the
physician just treated the

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:20.346 align:middle line:84%
symptoms as opposed to curing
it, there's a cure available,

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.581 align:middle line:90%
I would put him in jail

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.917 align:middle line:84%
for class A felony
for 25 years to life.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.453 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you did it to
the first thousand physicians,

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:29.421 align:middle line:84%
the rest of them start
recommending the cure, right,

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:31.424 align:middle line:84%
because they wouldn't
want to go to jail.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Pretty strong
words. My next guest,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.395 align:middle line:90%

I appreciate your hospitality.

there in that little video clip.

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.503 align:middle line:84%

only people who can kill,

00:01:47.272 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:84%

million people each year,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.378 align:middle line:84%
not even get a parking
ticket and they get to walk.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
This is from the Center
for Disease Control.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.284 align:middle line:84%
This is February 5th, 2007,
15 million people are killed,

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.054 align:middle line:84%
injured, infected each year in
doctors' workplace, hospitals

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.857 align:middle line:84%
and clinics. They don't
even get a parking ticket.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.892 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Over prescriptions,
things like that?

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Prescriptions,
infections.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.528 align:middle line:84%
They don't even wash their
hands after they go potty.

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:11.698 align:middle line:84%
Doctors kill more people
each year in America

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.934 align:middle line:84%
than the Mafia has
in a thousand years.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You know, I
have done stories, Joel,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.842 align:middle line:84%
on surgical procedures
where they sew the person up

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:27.113 align:middle line:84%
and they'd left in
instruments, gauze,

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.581 align:middle line:90%
you name it, horror stories.

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.049 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, the doctor
has other things on his mind.

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:36.288 align:middle line:84%
OK? He is thinking about
chasing the nurse as opposed

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:37.357 align:middle line:90%
to taking care of the patient.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:90%
He was out last night drinking.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.097 align:middle line:84%
He's thinking about his golf
date with his golf buddy.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And the horror stories for me
are the ones where women go

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.502 align:middle line:84%
in to have babies and they
cut their arms and legs off.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What?

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Yes, this
happens hundreds of times here

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:55.108 align:middle line:84%
in America and he thought
it was a different patient.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.877 align:middle line:84%
He thought it was a patient
with flesh eating strep and--

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:59.078 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Oh my God.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: -- the crime,
George, is that the nurses

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.949 align:middle line:84%
and the other doctors in
the room never say anything.

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.485 align:middle line:84%
They say, "Doctor, wait a
minute, what are you doing here?

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.921 align:middle line:84%
This here-- lady is
here for delivery,

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.557 align:middle line:84%
not getting their arms
and legs cut off."

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:13.393 align:middle line:84%
And this happens every year
and these same doctors remain

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.527 align:middle line:84%
in those hospitals and
in those clinics forever.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.896 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You've got an
interesting background,

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.164 align:middle line:90%
very varied.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.533 align:middle line:84%
You've got into sciences,
Bachelor of Science degree.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:25.572 align:middle line:84%
You then got your DVM, doctor
of veterinary medicine.

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:28.708 align:middle line:84%
But you understand nutrition
and I mean your goal now is

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.744 align:middle line:84%
to help people, and I'm sure you
still help and love animals too,

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.379 align:middle line:84%
but how did you make
that transition?

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, as
you point out George,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.482 align:middle line:84%
my background is
a little unique.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.618 align:middle line:84%
I do have a degree in
agriculture but my major is

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.119 align:middle line:84%
in animal husbandry
and nutrition

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.156 align:middle line:84%
where we've made rations,
came up with diets for animals

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.124 align:middle line:90%
to increase their performance.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.927 align:middle line:84%
More eggs per pound of feed,
more milk per pound of feed,

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.429 align:middle line:84%
more meat per pound of
feed, more longevity,

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:53.098 align:middle line:84%
eliminate every birth
defects you can think of.

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:55.435 align:middle line:90%
And then I became a veterinarian

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.537 align:middle line:84%
and as a sophomore
veterinary student,

00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:00.206 align:middle line:84%
I was already a graduate
student 'cause I have my degree

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.574 align:middle line:90%
in agriculture.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.843 align:middle line:84%
I found the first case of
a mass die-off in America

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:06.079 align:middle line:90%
from pollution and wrote it up.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.747 align:middle line:84%
I got it published in
scientific journals.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
It was quite the thing, went
around the world several times.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.553 align:middle line:84%
And then I was in Africa
for Marlin Perkins,

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:16.189 align:middle line:84%
from the old Mutual--
Wild Kingdom.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.788 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: From Saint Louis.

00:04:16.788 --> 00:04:18.358 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes, yes, sir.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was working
with Barry Commoner

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.362 align:middle line:84%
who is an environmentalist
who ran for--

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:23.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Commoner?

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: -- common cause.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:27.834 align:middle line:84%
Yes, yes. And so I was catching
white rhino to save them

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
from extinction and
between Barry Commoner

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.107 align:middle line:84%
and Marlin Perkins, they
came up with a grant from NIH

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:38.177 align:middle line:84%
to study pollution as a
contributing cause or the cause

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:41.748 align:middle line:84%
of degenerative diseases, heart
disease, cancer and this sort

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.916 align:middle line:84%
of thing and Perkins says
I know the perfect guy.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:45.752 align:middle line:84%
He wrote the first paper in
a mass die-off for pollution.

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:46.786 align:middle line:90%
They pulled me out of Africa

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.021 align:middle line:84%
and be the pathologist
on the project.

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:53.927 align:middle line:84%
In 1977, I discovered after
doing 20,000 autopsies

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:56.562 align:middle line:84%
in that one project, 10 million
chemistries all published

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.931 align:middle line:90%
in a book, 1200 pages,

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.667 align:middle line:84%
called the "Diseases
of Exotic Animals".

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:01.534 align:middle line:84%
It's in the Smithsonian
Institute,

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:90%
it's a national treasure.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.639 align:middle line:84%
I discovered it at
the Emory University

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.677 align:middle line:84%
at the Yerkes Primate
Center in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.579 align:middle line:84%
the first nonhuman case of
cystic fibrosis and determined

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:17.016 align:middle line:84%
that it was actually a
nutritional deficiency during

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
pregnancy as opposed to
genetically transmitted disease.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.487 align:middle line:84%
And I pointed this
out and they fired me.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They fired
you because of that?

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:24.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:25.925 align:middle line:84%
They said, "Wallach, you
must be sniffing goo.

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:28.061 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows it's
a genetically

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:28.995 align:middle line:90%
transmitted disease."

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.296 align:middle line:90%
I said, "No.

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:32.332 align:middle line:84%
You tell me how many monkeys
you want with cystic fibrosis,

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:32.932 align:middle line:90%
I can make them for any year."

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:34.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And they say, "Well,
you're not in any contract.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.003 align:middle line:90%
You're fired."

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.037 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I
went back to school

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:40.606 align:middle line:84%
and became a primary
care physician,

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:42.208 align:middle line:90%
as an h-pathic physician.

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:46.579 align:middle line:84%
Practiced for 12 years learning
how to use veterinary treatments

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:47.847 align:middle line:90%
on my human patients.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, affectionately,
the first treatment I used

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.987 align:middle line:84%
on patients because of
arthritis was Dr. Wallach's pig

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:56.089 align:middle line:90%
arthritis formula.

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was so successful
I've branched off

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.727 align:middle line:84%
into every other disease
you could think of

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:03.596 align:middle line:84%
and of course today
through Youngevity we do it

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:04.931 align:middle line:90%
over 900 different diseases.

00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:07.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How do we here in
the United States, doctor,

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:10.503 align:middle line:84%
how do we compare
to other countries?

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:11.604 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: We don't
do very well.

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:84%
We spend more money
each year, George,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.641 align:middle line:84%
than all the other nations
in the world combined,

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:18.244 align:middle line:84%
not more than any nation,
more than all nations.

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
There's 204 nations registered
in the United Nations.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.116 align:middle line:84%
We spend more money
for healthcare than all

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:27.487 align:middle line:84%
of them combined, and we rank
92nd in health on those,

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:28.287 align:middle line:90%
there's 91 other nations--

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:29.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's horrible.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: You wouldn't keep
on with any other industry

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.627 align:middle line:90%
with statistics like that.

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:36.929 align:middle line:90%
We rank 60th in longevity.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:40.032 align:middle line:84%
There's 59 other nations whose
peoples live longer than us.

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:42.802 align:middle line:84%
And God forgive us, George,
we rank 41st when it comes

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:46.005 align:middle line:84%
to live births and first month
survivability of our babies.

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:48.508 align:middle line:84%
And I have to wag on my
finger the OBGYNs 'cause

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:90%
in the animal industry,

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.313 align:middle line:84%
we've eliminated every birth
defect you can name just

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:55.581 align:middle line:90%
by putting nutrition

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.216 align:middle line:84%
in the female food
before they conceive.

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:58.618 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Right, we're not
doing that now, are we?

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:00.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: No.

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:02.555 align:middle line:84%
Food chemistry, very well
respected journal came

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:05.324 align:middle line:90%
out in April of 2012 and said--

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:09.328 align:middle line:84%
and they looked at the top
eight commercial baby formulas

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:12.632 align:middle line:84%
or Enfamil, Similac, Gerber
and these sorts of things--

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:15.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach:-- is they
contain less than 20 percent

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:84%
of the nutrients needed
by babies, vitamins

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.005 align:middle line:84%
and minerals, less
than 20 percent.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:22.041 align:middle line:84%
Now, George, dog foods
have 100 percent,

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:22.809 align:middle line:90%
chicken food has 100 percent.

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:24.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:25.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And laboratory
rat food has 100 percent

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:27.747 align:middle line:84%
and our babies have
less than 20 percent.

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:31.217 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we
have ADD, ADHD, autism.

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:36.222 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have a plethora
of diseases there are in kids.

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:39.692 align:middle line:84%
Deafness, congenital deafness
is caused by deficiency

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.961 align:middle line:84%
of magnesium-- oh, excuse
me-- manganese, excuse me,

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.362 align:middle line:90%
manganese during pregnancy.

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.698 align:middle line:84%
Manganese during pregnant--
if every woman got manganese,

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:48.234 align:middle line:84%
there'd never be another
baby born deaf, as simple.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:52.171 align:middle line:84%
Muscular dystrophy is a simple
nutritional deficiency during

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:53.839 align:middle line:84%
pregnancy very similar
to cystic fibrosis.

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:58.211 align:middle line:84%
I actually gave Jerry Lewis this
information three years ago.

00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.879 align:middle line:84%
He took it to the Muscular
Dystrophy Foundation

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.214 align:middle line:90%
and they fired Jerry Lewis,

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:02.482 align:middle line:84%
that's why he's not doing
the telethon anymore.

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.783 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I was wondering
what happened after all that.

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:07.186 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he went out with
a ball of no glory--

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Exactly.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.021 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It was just
poof, he was gone.

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: They
hid him, George,

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.492 align:middle line:84%
because he brought
them the cure.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:16.229 align:middle line:84%
So now we have another
little foundation started up

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:18.931 align:middle line:84%
and we are curing these
kids right, left and center

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.733 align:middle line:90%
for muscular dystrophy.

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:22.401 align:middle line:84%
We're filming them
every two weeks.

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.537 align:middle line:84%
Younger ones who are say
three years old who lay there

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:27.839 align:middle line:84%
like worms 'cause they have no
strength in their back and hips

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:30.977 align:middle line:84%
and their legs, within
three weeks on out program,

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:32.178 align:middle line:90%
they're out riding a tricycle--

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.546 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And this is
just with nutritional--

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:34.614 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes sir.

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:36.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory:-- supplements,
looking at that.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Yes, it's not a
genetically transmitted disease

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.185 align:middle line:84%
as the medical doctors
want you to believe.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:43.556 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this is not
unusual for the medical system.

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:46.159 align:middle line:84%
You go back thousands
of years ago

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.727 align:middle line:84%
when doctors thought everything
was cause by evil spirits.

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:50.429 align:middle line:84%
And that theory lasted
for 5000 years.

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:55.067 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think the genetic
theory is going to last 200.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:57.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: When you
started investigating this,

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:59.739 align:middle line:84%
how did you know how to
match what supplement,

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:04.644 align:middle line:84%
what nutritional supplement
with the affliction?

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:07.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, George, the
beauty of being a veterinarian

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:09.782 align:middle line:84%
and a physician, I can
read both languages.

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:11.217 align:middle line:90%
And in veterinary medicine,

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.919 align:middle line:84%
we don't have health
insurance for animals.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:13.786 align:middle line:90%
It's the biggest...

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:15.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yet.

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: This is
not going to come.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.526 align:middle line:84%
That's-- If we already use
health insurance similar

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:21.694 align:middle line:90%
to human health insurance.

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:25.765 align:middle line:84%
A hammer would cost
you 500 dollars,

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:90%
just pay for the healthcare.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.569 align:middle line:84%
If we were to use a human
healthcare type system

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.672 align:middle line:84%
for animals, a dozen eggs
would cost you 250 dollars.

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And so what we learn
to do is just prevent

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.208 align:middle line:84%
and reverse these
diseases with nutrition.

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:41.147 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I'm so strong
about telling people, look,

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.782 align:middle line:84%
if I were the US
Surgeon General,

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.884 align:middle line:90%
if there's a cure available,

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:46.886 align:middle line:84%
if doctors didn't cure
you, they go to jail.

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:50.356 align:middle line:84%
And this is because in the
animal industry we do cure

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:51.457 align:middle line:90%
these diseases.

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:54.427 align:middle line:84%
Macular degeneration, I
had a doctor jump up in one

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.296 align:middle line:84%
of my meetings and say
I was a liar when I said

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:59.365 align:middle line:84%
that I could reverse
macular degeneration even

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:03.369 align:middle line:84%
if they'd been blind 8, 10 years
and, you know, legally blind.

00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:05.938 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I'll tell you
what, sir, if you give me 12

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:84%
of your patients that
are legally blind,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.175 align:middle line:90%
'cause he's an eye doctor.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.176 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:12.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And if I
had 8, 10, 20 years,

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:15.114 align:middle line:84%
if I could reverse half of
them, say 6 out of the 12,

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:17.984 align:middle line:84%
they're reading 20/20 in 90
days, would you apologize?

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:19.785 align:middle line:84%
So if you could do two,
I'll apologize, or one.

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:22.121 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:23.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And so he-- the
next day he brought me a box

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.993 align:middle line:84%
with 27 charts and I took
them all and in 90 days,

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:30.963 align:middle line:84%
25 can read 20/20 without
eyeglasses, the other two--

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:31.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Amazing.

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:32.832 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach:-- with eyeglasses,

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:33.866 align:middle line:84%
but they were all
legally blind--

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:35.101 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Did you
make him a believer?

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:36.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, he
actually made me a CD called

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.938 align:middle line:84%
"Seeing is Believing" we
sell millions of them a year.

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:39.972 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Just because of that?

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:40.906 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Yes,
that was his apology.

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:43.376 align:middle line:90%
He actually made a CD for me.

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:45.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Has he become a
booster of your idea now?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:46.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes, sir.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Yes, sir. He is a
champion of our program.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The FDA of
course really comes

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:54.453 align:middle line:84%
down on those people who make
claims that we can do this.

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:57.123 align:middle line:90%
We can cure this.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:59.659 align:middle line:90%
Has that been tough for you?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:03.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, I'm kind
of a military minded guy.

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:07.433 align:middle line:84%
And so, I like to take it to
the enemy so to speak as opposes

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:09.168 align:middle line:90%
to just being defensive.

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:14.874 align:middle line:84%
And so, I actually either as a
co-plaintiff, or a plaintiff,

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:18.177 align:middle line:84%
sole plaintiff, I've
sued the FDA eight times.

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:19.845 align:middle line:84%
Prevailed every time
in federal court.

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.214 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else have ever
done that before.

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:23.983 align:middle line:84%
And one of which of
course was folic acid

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:28.688 align:middle line:84%
for neural tube defects,
like spina bifida.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:29.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:33.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And another
one was for omega-3's

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:36.262 align:middle line:84%
for preventing stroke,
thrombotic stroke

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:37.897 align:middle line:84%
and pulmonary embolism,
pulmonary thrombosis

00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:38.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Fish oil, isn't it?

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:40.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Exactly.

00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:43.369 align:middle line:84%
But we knew that in the animal
industry for hundreds of years

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.604 align:middle line:84%
but you couldn't say it
for the human industry.

00:11:45.604 --> 00:11:47.106 align:middle line:84%
So I actually sue them to be
able to say it for the human.

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:50.342 align:middle line:84%
So now everybody has on their
label 'cause we didn't do it

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:53.245 align:middle line:84%
just for our company, we did
it for humanity so to speak.

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:56.015 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with selenium
and we're getting ready

00:11:56.015 --> 00:12:00.086 align:middle line:84%
to sue the FDA over
trans fatty acids.

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:03.756 align:middle line:84%
And of course for our
selenium one, I can now say

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:06.592 align:middle line:84%
that by supplementing with 200
micrograms of selenium you can--

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:10.396 align:middle line:84%
you can reduce your risk
of certain types of cancers

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:11.731 align:middle line:84%
and it supports the
body's ability

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.165 align:middle line:90%
to make anticancer substances

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:15.401 align:middle line:84%
where before I sue them
we couldn't do that.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.936 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting ready
in preparing to sue them

00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:21.407 align:middle line:84%
over the trans fats thing
which I've been screaming

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:24.777 align:middle line:84%
about since the '70s
'cause it's not cholesterol

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:27.546 align:middle line:84%
that causes clogged arteries
and heart attacks and strokes.

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:28.047 align:middle line:90%
It's never been cholesterol.

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:29.115 align:middle line:90%
I wrote a paper on--

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:31.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So is it
the inflammation?

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:32.718 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Yes, sir, you hit
the nail right on the head.

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:33.586 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.054 align:middle line:90%
You know more than doctors.

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:36.889 align:middle line:84%
'Cause they think it's
still the cholesterol.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I study this stuff.

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.191 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yeah.

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:40.025 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's obvious
that you do a good job

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:90%
and that's why I'm here.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.529 align:middle line:84%
You know, I really
appreciate everything you do.

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:48.334 align:middle line:84%
And in 1971, I compared the
obstructive artery disease

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:50.469 align:middle line:84%
in vegetarians, vegans
and meat eaters.

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:51.337 align:middle line:90%
It was always the vegans

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:53.272 align:middle line:84%
that had the worst
obstructive arteries

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.141 align:middle line:84%
because of the oxidation,
the oils in...

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:55.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Go figure.

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:57.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Right.

00:12:57.276 --> 00:13:00.112 align:middle line:84%
Grains and salad dressings and
cooking oils, the inflammation.

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:05.451 align:middle line:84%
And so now, the FDA is saying,
"Oh hold, wait a minute,

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:08.387 align:middle line:84%
we got to get all the
trans fats off the market."

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:10.923 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, we've been
saying that for 40 years.

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:17.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: When you put together
a special regimen for somebody

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:20.699 align:middle line:84%
to attack some kind of
problem as you were talking

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.935 align:middle line:90%
about the macular degeneration,

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:25.905 align:middle line:84%
does it always work
that quickly?

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:27.006 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes, sir.

00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:28.641 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a congestive
heart failure

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:29.975 align:middle line:84%
which is the most common cause
of heart death in America,

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:33.012 align:middle line:84%
very commonly, you
know, people we put

00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:36.782 align:middle line:84%
on heart transplant list
are certainly multiples

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:90%
in medications.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.086 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered in the
late 1700s to be a deficiency

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:44.457 align:middle line:84%
of a single vitamin by a
Japanese naval surgeon.

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:47.092 align:middle line:84%
And I have actually reversed
and cured, obviously cured,

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:49.662 align:middle line:84%
'cause this is curable,
congestive heart failure,

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:50.362 align:middle line:90%
with a single vitamin.

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:51.697 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What was that vitamin?

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:53.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: It is really exotic.

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:55.201 align:middle line:90%
It's thiamine, vitamin B1.

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:55.968 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's it?

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:57.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: That's it.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:00.172 align:middle line:84%
And so, the thing that we
always have to be concerned

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:02.741 align:middle line:84%
about though, George,
is that all vertebrates,

00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:05.077 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a humming bird
or a human being or an elephant,

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:07.046 align:middle line:84%
all vertebrae's require
90 essential nutrients.

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:09.982 align:middle line:84%
And people they hear,
"Oh, that thiamine work

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:12.351 align:middle line:90%
for congestive heart failure."

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And they run to the grocery
store, to the healthy store

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.888 align:middle line:90%
and they'll buy a thiamine

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:16.722 align:middle line:84%
and they'll take it
and it won't work.

00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:18.257 align:middle line:90%
They said, why it didn't work.

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:23.229 align:middle line:84%
That's because nothing in
nature works in a vacuum.

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:26.065 align:middle line:84%
All vertebrates require
90 essential nutrients,

00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:29.201 align:middle line:84%
60 minerals, 16 vitamins,
12 essential amino acids

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.135 align:middle line:84%
and 3 essential fatty
acids, and they all work

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:32.304 align:middle line:90%
as co-factors with each other.

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:32.972 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They all
jumpstart each other.

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:34.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Exactly.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:35.875 align:middle line:84%
And one won't work
without the other.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.076 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of interesting.

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:40.179 align:middle line:84%
Linus Pauling, when he received
his first Nobel Prize in 1954

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:44.316 align:middle line:84%
for doing the research into
the nutrition of genes,

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:47.286 align:middle line:84%
it's very profound statement,
the nutrition of genes

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:50.389 align:middle line:90%
and the nutrition of enzymes,

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:51.957 align:middle line:84%
in his acceptance speech he says
you can trace every illness,

00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:55.127 align:middle line:84%
every disease and every
sickness to a mineral deficiency

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:57.129 align:middle line:84%
because genes and
enzymes will not work

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:58.998 align:middle line:90%
without mineral supplements.

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:03.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And we don't get that
out of our daily food, do we?

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:05.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: We don't,
and the reason

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:07.273 align:middle line:84%
for that is we've changed
everything that we had done

00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:10.476 align:middle line:84%
for thousands and thousand
of thousands of years

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:12.645 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't make
up the difference.

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:15.614 align:middle line:84%
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon,
it is my favorite thing,

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:16.916 align:middle line:90%
thank you for asking it.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.184 align:middle line:84%
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon,
Monday, September 4th,

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:22.187 align:middle line:90%
1882 everything changed.

00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:24.423 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, human
beings were supplementing

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:25.457 align:middle line:90%
with minerals everyday.

00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:27.326 align:middle line:84%
They weren't doing
it in the capsule

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:29.361 align:middle line:84%
but what they were doing
was putting the wood ashes

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
from their fireplace and
from their wood stove

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.098 align:middle line:84%
and their fire pits
into the gardens

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:36.035 align:middle line:84%
and wood ashes, they're
not ashes--

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Which is
a fertilizer, right?

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:38.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Right, wood
ashes are not ashes, George.

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:40.205 align:middle line:90%
It is, AKA ashes.

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:41.407 align:middle line:90%
It is really plant minerals

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:42.875 align:middle line:84%
of the tree sucked
up out of the ground.

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:46.478 align:middle line:84%
And you throw these minerals,
AKA wood ashes into the garden

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:49.047 align:middle line:84%
and the corn and the tomatoes
and the sweet potatoes and peas

00:15:49.047 --> 00:15:50.382 align:middle line:90%
and beans suck them all up.

00:15:50.382 --> 00:15:51.216 align:middle line:84%
And you ate that food, you
got your mineral supplements

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:54.253 align:middle line:90%
everyday through that fashion.

00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:56.522 align:middle line:84%
Well, 3 o'clock in the
afternoon, Monday September 4th,

00:15:56.522 --> 00:16:00.592 align:middle line:84%
1882 on Pearl Street, New York,
in the front page news story

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:03.295 align:middle line:84%
in every newspaper in the world,
Thomas Edison pulled the switch

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:06.799 align:middle line:84%
on the first commercial
electric generating plant.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:07.666 align:middle line:90%
And in 10 years--

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:08.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So, you
didn't have that.

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:10.102 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Exactly right.

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:12.304 align:middle line:84%
Within 10 years, every
town and every city

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:13.238 align:middle line:84%
in the industrialized
world converted from wood

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:17.142 align:middle line:84%
as the universal
fuel to electricity.

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:20.179 align:middle line:84%
And what happened to our source
of mineral supplementation?

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:22.047 align:middle line:90%
Went away.

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:22.982 align:middle line:90%
And nobody--

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:23.916 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And never replaced it.

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: They
never replaced it.

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.019 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're getting
sicker and sicker and sicker.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:29.588 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, George,
more profoundly,

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:30.856 align:middle line:90%
the top 20 longevity cultures

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:33.859 align:middle line:84%
on earth are all third
world illiterate countries

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:36.562 align:middle line:84%
and cultures that have
no doctors, no insurance,

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:84%
government or private,
no hospitals or clinics,

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.799 align:middle line:84%
and they have 40 times the
minerals we do

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.868 align:middle line:84%
because they're still putting
their wood ashes in the garden.

00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:44.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Ain't that amazing?

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:45.204 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:47.006 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Truly.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.172 align:middle line:90%
And this is all documented.

00:16:48.172 --> 00:16:50.442 align:middle line:84%
I have a new book coming
out called "Epigenetics"

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:51.377 align:middle line:84%
and it's all documented
in this book.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:53.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's
coming out in March.

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:54.947 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: In March of 2014.

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:56.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Well, that is good.

00:16:56.047 --> 00:17:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Joel, what's our biggest
killer in this country today?

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: The number one cause
of death in America is doctors.

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:05.391 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Still doctors.

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:06.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Still
doctors, yes sir.

00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:07.759 align:middle line:90%
Number two is--

00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:09.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, there are
good doctors, right, they try.

00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:12.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, I
beg to differ with you.

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Really, you
think they're all bad?

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, when you
go back in the history,

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:20.005 align:middle line:84%
just even in modern
history, you've heard

00:17:20.005 --> 00:17:21.707 align:middle line:90%
of eugenics of course.

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:22.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.509 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And this is actually
Charles Darwin's cousin,

00:17:24.509 --> 00:17:27.513 align:middle line:84%
Francis Galton that came
up with that, and he wanted

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:30.315 align:middle line:84%
to breed people like they did
animals 'cause he had big

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:32.818 align:middle line:84%
estates with cattle and
he would take the cow

00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:34.787 align:middle line:84%
to produce the most milk and
breed it with the best bull

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:36.822 align:middle line:84%
and so they get more calves
that produce more milk.

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.157 align:middle line:84%
And they would eat the ones
who didn't do a very good job.

00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:41.393 align:middle line:84%
And so they came up with dating
clubs for the tall, blue-eyed,

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:43.762 align:middle line:84%
blond-haired people to
date tall, blond-haired,

00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:46.465 align:middle line:84%
blue-eyed people, and
that was in the 1830s

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:48.700 align:middle line:90%
and then comes Hitler of course.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.371 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of interesting
to me that the biggest segment

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:54.973 align:middle line:84%
of the Nazis after
the Nuremberg trial

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
that were hung were the
doctors, the Nazi doctors.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.944 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Like the Mengeles.

00:17:58.944 --> 00:17:59.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes.

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:00.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: People like that.

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:01.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: But they
had scores of them.

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.482 align:middle line:84%
They were hung for
their war crimes.

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:04.683 align:middle line:84%
There was only a handful
of generals 'cause most

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:06.285 align:middle line:84%
of them were just following
the orders from above.

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:09.855 align:middle line:84%
They got put in jail
for 50 years or life.

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:12.391 align:middle line:84%
Some of the generals are getting
out of jail now and they're

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:15.360 align:middle line:84%
in their 90s, who did
terrible things but they were

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.262 align:middle line:90%
under orders to do them.

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:19.398 align:middle line:84%
But the doctors,
they were the ones

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:21.166 align:middle line:84%
who invented the
terrible things.

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:25.537 align:middle line:84%
And so, they were the biggest
group of people in the Nazi army

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:28.307 align:middle line:84%
that were hung during
the Nuremberg trials.

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:30.576 align:middle line:84%
So doctors have been bad
boys for a long time.

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:34.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Is it because
they just don't know.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:35.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well,
that's the problem.

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:36.315 align:middle line:84%
Let's say they didn't
know, let's say they--

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:38.283 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Give the benefit.

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:39.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Give them
the benefit of the doubt

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:41.487 align:middle line:84%
and say they're ignorant,
George.

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:44.523 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen a doctor
burn his license on the steps

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:46.058 align:middle line:90%
of the courthouse and says,

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:47.359 align:middle line:84%
"I cannot do this anymore 'cause
we're killing too many people."

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:48.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No.

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:50.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: "I'm going to
devote my life to being a nurse

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:57.936 align:middle line:84%
and Lambaren, Congo,
you know, like Dr. Schweitzer.

00:18:57.936 --> 00:18:58.437 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:18:58.437 --> 00:18:59.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yeah.

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:00.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And all
those days go on.

00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:02.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And so
doctors never do that.

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:06.011 align:middle line:84%
They just-- it's kind of like
when somebody cuts the arms

00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:06.879 align:middle line:90%
and legs off a woman who goes

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:10.182 align:middle line:84%
in to have a baby,
nobody says anything.

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:13.886 align:middle line:84%
And so the way to solve the
problem is to not use them,

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:84%
which means people have to
take more responsibility

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.723 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to take
care of themselves,

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:20.125 align:middle line:84%
and this is what we
do with Youngevity.

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:23.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You have a website set
up called criticalhealthnews.com

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:27.466 align:middle line:84%
which has been set up for
people to get ongoing stories

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and to help themselves
to get through.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.705 align:middle line:90%
Can people self diagnose, doc?

00:19:33.705 --> 00:19:34.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Well, absolutely.

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:35.807 align:middle line:90%
We have a book which you can get

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:37.476 align:middle line:84%
through the website
called "Let's Play Doctor".

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:39.545 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has said
that at some type

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:40.579 align:middle line:84%
in their life, let's
play doctor.

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:41.346 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I did when
I was like nine.

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: There you go.

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, beginning your
puberty drives you

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:49.054 align:middle line:90%
to want to be a doctor.

00:19:49.054 --> 00:19:51.456 align:middle line:90%
And this book tells people how

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:53.959 align:middle line:84%
to do their own self
examination,

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:56.461 align:middle line:84%
how to do their own diagnosis,
how to do their own physicals

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.964 align:middle line:84%
for about 3 dollars
and 50 cents.

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:01.333 align:middle line:84%
They can go to any pharmacy
and get the same test strips

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:02.534 align:middle line:84%
that doctors use
for your urine test

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:03.902 align:middle line:90%
in the office and blood test.

00:20:03.902 --> 00:20:06.939 align:middle line:84%
You can make your own
diagnosis for blood pressure.

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:84%
You can make your own
diagnosis for diabetes.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.276 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to have
colonoscopic exams.

00:20:11.276 --> 00:20:12.611 align:middle line:84%
You can do what's
called occult blood test,

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:14.046 align:middle line:90%
cost you 5 bucks for that.

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.314 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:20:15.314 --> 00:20:16.648 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: There are no risk
of puncturing your intestines

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:17.382 align:middle line:84%
and killing you like
they did Andy Rooney.

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:19.551 align:middle line:90%
They killed Andy--

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:20.185 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, let me
tell you a real quick story

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:21.286 align:middle line:90%
and we'll get into this.

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:23.722 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend of
mine in Saint Louis,

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:29.061 align:middle line:84%
very well known ophthalmologist,
eye doctor and he decided--

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:33.732 align:middle line:84%
you know, when you're past 50,
time to go in for colonoscopy.

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And he went to his best
friend who was another doctor

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.607 align:middle line:84%
who performed the
colonoscopy on him.

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:46.578 align:middle line:84%
In the process, they punctured
his intestine and they went,

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:50.215 align:middle line:84%
"Oh my god, what are we
going to do about this?"

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:54.086 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of a shock set in.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:57.222 align:middle line:84%
And they literally had
to remove his intestine.

00:20:57.222 --> 00:21:00.592 align:middle line:84%
They took it out of his body
and bathed it for three

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:05.631 align:middle line:84%
or four days, put it back
in, he's never been the same,

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:09.501 align:middle line:84%
never been the same
just from that routine,

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:14.006 align:middle line:90%
so called routine checkup.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, George,
the statistics are,

00:21:15.707 --> 00:21:17.109 align:middle line:84%
according to the US
Department of Health

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:20.112 align:middle line:84%
and Human Service Office
of Inspector General,

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:84%
this was November 2011,
they said each month

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.887 align:middle line:84%
in America medical doctors kill
15,000 seniors over the age

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:31.523 align:middle line:84%
of 65 who go in for these
routine minor medical procedures

00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:33.358 align:middle line:90%
and screening test.

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:38.697 align:middle line:84%
That's 180,000 a year are killed
because of this very thing.

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:40.699 align:middle line:90%
Andy Rooney was killed by that.

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:44.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Thank God, for
virtual testing these days.

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:45.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: We can do your
own colonoscopic exam with a

00:21:45.837 --> 00:21:48.173 align:middle line:84%
so called blood test
for 5 bucks.

00:21:48.173 --> 00:21:48.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Where do you get that?

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:49.574 align:middle line:90%
Out of a drugstore or-- ?

00:21:49.574 --> 00:21:50.776 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes, sir.

00:21:50.776 --> 00:21:52.244 align:middle line:84%
You just go in without
prescription, get it,

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:53.845 align:middle line:84%
just talk to the drug store,
"I want an occult blood test."

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:55.647 align:middle line:90%
And when you wipe your bottom,

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:57.783 align:middle line:84%
you take some soiled toilet
paper and put the poop

00:21:57.783 --> 00:21:59.551 align:middle line:84%
on the gel and if it turns
a color, you get an

00:21:59.551 --> 00:22:00.519 align:middle line:90%
unseen blood.

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Well, that sounds--

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Nasty.

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:04.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Nasty little job.

00:22:04.356 --> 00:22:05.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Yeah,
but it will save you

00:22:05.757 --> 00:22:06.491 align:middle line:84%
from getting your
intestines punctured

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:07.492 align:middle line:90%
and dying of peritonitis.

00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:09.328 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Can you believe that?

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:10.462 align:middle line:90%
He was healthy and now he's not.

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:12.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes.

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:13.065 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And he's life
was changed dramatically

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:14.032 align:middle line:90%
because of this.

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:15.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And do the
doctor even take him

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:16.868 align:middle line:90%
out to dinner and say I'm sorry?

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:18.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: No, that
has not happened.

00:22:18.403 --> 00:22:22.541 align:middle line:84%
He's contemplating whether he
should sue for malpractice,

00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:24.609 align:middle line:84%
but it's his friend and he
doesn't know what to do.

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: He should sue him.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You know I--

00:22:26.778 --> 00:22:27.546 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: There should be
consequences for these things.

00:22:27.546 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Horrible situation.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, doctors again,
according to the CDC operate

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:35.454 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong person
or the wrong body part

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:36.521 align:middle line:90%
as often as 40 times a week.

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: How does that happen?

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Because--

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:39.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: How does that happen?

00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:42.561 align:middle line:84%
I mean a guy goes in
to have a leg removed

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:43.695 align:middle line:90%
and they take the wrong leg off.

00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:44.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, he
gets paid twice then,

00:22:44.629 --> 00:22:46.598 align:middle line:90%
the doctor is paid twice then.

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:47.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And then they have

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
to take the other
leg off still, right?

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.102 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes.

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:52.437 align:middle line:84%
So they get paid twice because
the insurance always paid

00:22:52.437 --> 00:22:53.572 align:middle line:90%
for the mess up as well as--

00:22:53.572 --> 00:22:56.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I mean
who wants a check

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:58.710 align:middle line:84%
when your leg has been
cut off-- the wrong one?

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean how do they even
pay the doctors twice?

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.048 align:middle line:90%
How do they make that mistake?

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:04.616 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, that's
because their mind is not

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:06.752 align:middle line:90%
on what they're doing, OK?

00:23:06.752 --> 00:23:08.487 align:middle line:84%
They come in there-- again,
they're more interested in--

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:09.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I would
check, double check,

00:23:09.287 --> 00:23:11.289 align:middle line:90%
double check, triple check.

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:13.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, that's because
you're a righteous person.

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:15.394 align:middle line:84%
Most doctors again
are not standing

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:18.029 align:middle line:84%
on the courthouse steps
burning their license and say,

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.164 align:middle line:84%
"I'm not going to do, I
cannot do this anymore.

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.733 align:middle line:84%
As a fellow human being,
I cannot do this anymore.

00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:24.102 align:middle line:84%
I have to find out why we're
making so many mistakes."

00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:25.637 align:middle line:84%
There's not a single
doctor that's done that.

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:27.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's frightening.

00:23:27.005 --> 00:23:27.572 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes.

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:28.974 align:middle line:90%
That's frightening.

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:30.976 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And so the only
recourse the American people

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:33.211 align:middle line:84%
have is to not use the
system which again--

00:23:33.211 --> 00:23:34.613 align:middle line:84%
and of course you have all
these various groups out there,

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:37.048 align:middle line:84%
there's the preppers
and doomsday preppers

00:23:37.048 --> 00:23:40.652 align:middle line:84%
and the survivalist, right, and
the Amish and people like this

00:23:40.652 --> 00:23:44.189 align:middle line:90%
who do their own thing.

00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:50.162 align:middle line:84%
And these are the people, again,
may look out there May of 2013,

00:23:50.162 --> 00:23:52.998 align:middle line:84%
there was a cover article,
a little bitty brown girl

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:56.034 align:middle line:84%
from Costa Rica, she was like
two years old, cute little girl

00:23:56.034 --> 00:23:58.937 align:middle line:84%
in the cover, says this
child will live to be 120.

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:01.373 align:middle line:84%
How can they say that, when you
read the article they've been

00:24:01.373 --> 00:24:02.374 align:middle line:90%
doing it for thousands of years?

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:03.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:04.843 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And they're
illiterate,

00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:84%
they're third world cultures,
they have no doctors, no private

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.616 align:middle line:84%
or government insurance,
no hospitals, no clinics.

00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:12.784 align:middle line:84%
They have 40 times a
hunger levels we do.

00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:15.821 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is they
don't get killed as often

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:16.955 align:middle line:90%
as we do by the doctors.

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:20.892 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I try to tell
my kids that you got

00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:90%
to take care of yourself.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:26.631 align:middle line:84%
Without your health,
nothing else matters.

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:30.435 align:middle line:84%
You let your children
down, their kids down,

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:33.605 align:middle line:84%
money doesn't matter, nothing
matters unless you have

00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:90%
your health.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.842 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many sick
people out there, Joel,

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:40.412 align:middle line:84%
and I know when I go to the
phone and said coast to coast

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:44.883 align:middle line:84%
and we just talk about
specific medical situations,

00:24:44.883 --> 00:24:49.721 align:middle line:84%
the phone lines are just buzzing
with people who are not healthy.

00:24:49.721 --> 00:24:51.089 align:middle line:90%
It's got to change.

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:52.224 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, we're
the number one obese nation

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:53.358 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:55.026 align:middle line:84%
Now we spend more money
for healthcare than a lot

00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:56.361 align:middle line:84%
of the other nation
in the world combined

00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:57.963 align:middle line:84%
and the only thing we can
brag about being number one

00:24:57.963 --> 00:25:00.499 align:middle line:84%
in the health industry is we're
number one in obesity.

00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:01.833 align:middle line:84%
With all their lap banding
and the gastric bypass,

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:05.871 align:middle line:84%
stomach stapling and all
the drugs, all the diets,

00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:07.572 align:middle line:84%
all the exercise, we're still
the number one obese nation

00:25:07.572 --> 00:25:08.473 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:09.541 align:middle line:90%
So, how can that be?

00:25:09.541 --> 00:25:10.876 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's 'cause
our theory is wrong.

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.844 align:middle line:84%
Obesity is not overeating,
it's not the lack of exercise,

00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:16.515 align:middle line:84%
it's actually a simple
nutritional deficiency.

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:17.883 align:middle line:90%
A nutrition that-- the symptom

00:25:17.883 --> 00:25:20.986 align:middle line:84%
of this particular nutritional
deficiency drives people

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:23.855 align:middle line:84%
to have cravings and
binge eating behaviors.

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:25.257 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:27.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Cribbing in
animals, it's called munchies

00:25:27.092 --> 00:25:29.561 align:middle line:90%
in people and it's very simple.

00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:33.265 align:middle line:84%
We get people to lose a half
a pound or two pounds a day.

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:34.799 align:middle line:84%
They keep it off as long as
they're staying on...

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Of real fat, right?

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Oh, yes
sir, yes sir.

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:39.771 align:middle line:84%
And they keep their muscle
mass, they lose the fat.

00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:42.674 align:middle line:84%
We get people lose 140
pounds in 100 days,

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:46.111 align:middle line:84%
60 pounds in 50 days,
very simple.

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:47.779 align:middle line:84%
Again, you have to supplement
with these nutrients.

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:49.981 align:middle line:90%
You take the basic 90 again

00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:52.384 align:middle line:84%
and then we have the
secret sauce, we call it.

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:54.252 align:middle line:90%
This drives the weight loss.

00:25:54.252 --> 00:25:56.187 align:middle line:84%
And then they maintain
a weight loss.

00:25:56.187 --> 00:25:57.856 align:middle line:84%
The magic of our
system is, George,

00:25:57.856 --> 00:26:00.058 align:middle line:90%
you never gain the weight back.

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:01.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I remember I
had a high glucose level.

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:08.266 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said to me, stay
off white bread, try to stay off

00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:10.835 align:middle line:84%
as many carbs as you
can like potatoes

00:26:10.835 --> 00:26:13.738 align:middle line:90%
and things like that and pastas.

00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:15.674 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
those levels did drop.

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:18.343 align:middle line:90%
They did drop.

00:26:18.343 --> 00:26:19.844 align:middle line:84%
How do you get high glucose
levels in the first place?

00:26:19.844 --> 00:26:22.347 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:24.349 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, there's
two pieces and number one,

00:26:24.349 --> 00:26:27.719 align:middle line:84%
improper diets and human beings
are never meant to eat grain.

00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:28.987 align:middle line:90%
They weren't.

00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:31.823 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that came along

00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:33.325 align:middle line:90%
because of a survival thing.

00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:34.726 align:middle line:90%
When things went bad--

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:35.694 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You have
to eat something.

00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:37.028 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: You had
to eat something

00:26:37.028 --> 00:26:37.929 align:middle line:84%
and you could store grains
back in thousands of years ago

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:40.332 align:middle line:84%
without refrigeration
and canning.

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:41.399 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:43.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And so, it
was a survival thing.

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:46.538 align:middle line:84%
But then it became, oh, you have
to eat grain all three meals,

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:47.806 align:middle line:90%
you have to eat your snacks

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:49.874 align:middle line:84%
and desserts are all
grains and that's too much.

00:26:49.874 --> 00:26:54.946 align:middle line:90%
But these sorts of things occur

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:84%
because of a simple mineral
deficiency like diabetes,

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.686 align:middle line:84%
it's caused actually by a
single mineral deficiency

00:27:01.686 --> 00:27:02.954 align:middle line:84%
that we've known
it for 70 years.

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:05.257 align:middle line:90%
So we can get rid of diabetes.

00:27:05.257 --> 00:27:07.025 align:middle line:84%
It was actually the head of
the Department of Agriculture

00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:09.327 align:middle line:90%
who figured it out 70 years ago.

00:27:09.327 --> 00:27:11.496 align:middle line:84%
And the medical system
never picked

00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:13.465 align:middle line:90%
up on it because it's secure.

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:16.768 align:middle line:84%
And you take these 90
essential nutrients,

00:27:16.768 --> 00:27:20.105 align:middle line:84%
you'd throw in the secret sauce
that it has these minerals in it

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:22.874 align:middle line:84%
and they take their fasting
blood sugar every morning.

00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:25.944 align:middle line:84%
And so before they
medicate themselves,

00:27:25.944 --> 00:27:26.978 align:middle line:84%
they have to adjust
their medication.

00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:28.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:29.314 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And usually
within two days

00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:30.915 align:middle line:84%
or two weeks throughout
their medication--

00:27:30.915 --> 00:27:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They start dropping.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:32.817 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes, sir.

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:34.853 align:middle line:84%
Well there-- and
certainly within a month,

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:37.055 align:middle line:84%
they're an ex-diabetic
and as long as they stay

00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:38.423 align:middle line:84%
on the program, they'll
never have diabetes again.

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:40.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I had heard cinnamon
helps reduce your blood sugar.

00:27:40.825 --> 00:27:41.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Cinnamon can
drop your blood sugar

00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:44.362 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't solve the
basic mineral deficiency.

00:27:44.362 --> 00:27:48.366 align:middle line:84%
Cinnamon is a plant
drug that actually--

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:50.402 align:middle line:84%
and of course we like to use
it because it's very dramatic.

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:52.804 align:middle line:84%
It will drop your blood
sugar very rapidly.

00:27:52.804 --> 00:27:54.339 align:middle line:90%
But it's a plant medicine.

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:55.273 align:middle line:90%
It's a plant drug.

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:56.975 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't solve the
mineral deficiency.

00:27:56.975 --> 00:27:58.176 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like--

00:27:58.176 --> 00:28:00.311 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: OK, doesn't
fix the problem.

00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:02.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Doesn't fix the
problem, it manages the symptom.

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:05.283 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with
lowering your blood sugar

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:07.852 align:middle line:84%
when you have diagnosed
diabetes, George,

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:12.557 align:middle line:84%
is that elevated blood sugar is
not the disease, it's a symptom.

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:13.692 align:middle line:90%
And so you're still going to die

00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:14.893 align:middle line:84%
of diabetes even though you
manage your blood sugar.

00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:16.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:18.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And so
that's the problem.

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:19.831 align:middle line:84%
You're still going to go
blind, get your legs cut off

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:21.299 align:middle line:84%
and die 25 years
early even though--

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:22.434 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't know what
happened to Aunt Ruthie,

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:24.202 align:middle line:84%
she used to keep her
blood sugar under control,

00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:25.670 align:middle line:90%
why did she die of a stroke?

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How big of a problem
is that in this country,

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:29.074 align:middle line:90%
type 2, type 2?

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:30.375 align:middle line:90%
Tom Hanks has it now.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well,
type 2 diabetes--

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.878 align:middle line:84%
well, if you have any contact,
well, you should call him

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:35.313 align:middle line:90%
because we can fix him.

00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:36.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I've got producer
Tommy is working on that,

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:37.882 align:middle line:84%
trying to get him on the
show just to talk about some

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:40.919 align:middle line:84%
of his work but you're
absolutely right

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:43.955 align:middle line:84%
in how dramatic would
that be if you got it--

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:45.990 align:middle line:84%
got him off, you know,
drugs for example.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Very easy,
we can do it very easily

00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:51.629 align:middle line:84%
and of course this
is a self help thing.

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And again in the book,
"Hell's Kitchen" and the book

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.703 align:middle line:84%
"Let's Play Doctor" we teach
people what to do to get rid

00:28:58.703 --> 00:29:00.071 align:middle line:90%
of their type 2 diabetes.

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:02.574 align:middle line:84%
And actually between
obesity and type 2 diabetes,

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:04.142 align:middle line:84%
it's going to financially
break America, particularly

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:08.747 align:middle line:84%
with the affordable healthcare
act is going ton break America

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:09.948 align:middle line:90%
with just those two diseases.

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:11.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:13.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Because the
rate is growing very rapidly

00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:16.020 align:middle line:84%
because the theories of the
medical system were incorrect.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.591 align:middle line:84%
They believe that type 2
diabetes is a genetically

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:20.658 align:middle line:90%
transmitted disease.

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:23.328 align:middle line:84%
It's not. It's a simple
nutritional deficiency.

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that
obesity is a genetically

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:26.831 align:middle line:90%
transmitted disease.

00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:29.134 align:middle line:84%
It is a simple nutritional
deficiency.

00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:31.102 align:middle line:84%
I have another book called
"Rare Earths: Forbidden Cures",

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:34.139 align:middle line:84%
chapter four, just that
whole chapter just tells you

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:36.174 align:middle line:84%
everything you need
to know about obesity.

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:37.909 align:middle line:84%
The book, the "Hell's Kitchen"
tells you everything you need

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:39.711 align:middle line:90%
to know about obesity.

00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in America, they
just did these simple things.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:45.316 align:middle line:84%
We can get rid of both
obesity and type 2 diabetes

00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:46.251 align:middle line:90%
in two months, three months.

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:47.118 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's common sense.

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:48.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes.

00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:49.187 align:middle line:84%
And we can make America
disease free,

00:29:49.187 --> 00:29:50.889 align:middle line:84%
just like we did
the animal industry.

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:56.194 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Dr. Joel Wallach's
website, criticalhealthnews.com.

00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:58.363 align:middle line:84%
Doc, thanks so much for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:29:58.363 --> 00:29:59.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well,
