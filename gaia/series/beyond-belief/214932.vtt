00:00:19.192 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:10%
Katie Paige is with us, the
CEO of the Rocky Mountain Ranch

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle line:10%
Research and the co-host
of the UAP Studies podcast.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Katie conducts independent
UFO investigations

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and is currently writing her new
book, The Rocky Mountain Ranch,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Crafts, Cattle,
Cryptids, and Cover-Ups.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.030 align:middle line:90%
What are the cover-ups, Katie?

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:10%
>>KATIE PAIGE: Well,
for over 10 years

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:10%
now, I've been doing a deep
dive on experiences my family

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:10%
and myself had out in Elbert
County Colorado at a very

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.433 align:middle line:10%
high strangeness location very
similar to the Skinwalker Ranch.

00:00:56.433 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same type of thing?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.767 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Same type of thing.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Almost identical
really, in so many ways.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:10%
And one of the questions I
always had was, how much of this

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.390 align:middle line:10%
is our own Black Access
projects going on out there?

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
We do have evidence
from the APRO files,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:84%
which stands for the
Aerial Phenomena Research

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Organization, that shows that
we had soldiers from Camp

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Carson on the
property that NORAD

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:84%
was aware of what was
going on out there, as well

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.902 align:middle line:84%
as the directive, Air
Force Academy head

00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:84%
was aware of what was
going on out there.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So I've always
wondered how much of it

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:84%
was actual unexplained
paranormal phenomenon, UAPs,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and such, and how much of it,
was Black Access government

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's taken me down so
many rabbit holes, George.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.553 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did many
people die on the ranch?

00:01:40.553 --> 00:01:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Not to my
knowledge, but what's

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
interesting about that is
looking at some of the aircraft.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So from '75 to
'78, this is where

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Linda Moulton Howe got her start
out there in Elbert County.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.597 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:90%
You are absolutely right.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, and
during those years,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:84%
the number of aircraft
crashes in that area

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:84%
is really high compared to other
years, where the phenomena seem

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:90%
to calm down.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And through the decades I
have found that the phenomena,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reason, and
I have a few theories

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.047 align:middle line:84%
on why this might be, but it
seems to heighten and then

00:02:12.047 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:84%
kind of drop a little bit,
and heighten, and drop,

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:90%
and heighten.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to go
on this almost seven

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:90%
or eight-year cycle.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Katie, paint us
a picture of the ranch.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:90%
What's it look like?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah,
well, it's 60 acres.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:90%
It's out there--

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.172 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Secluded?

00:02:26.172 --> 00:02:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, it
was secluded back

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.080 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s, but there's a lot
of cattle ranches out there.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.337 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, now, in 2024, we have
more development in the area

00:02:35.337 --> 00:02:36.545 align:middle line:90%
than we did back in the '70s.

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.903 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: But even now,
it's still pretty secluded.

00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But it was a 60-acre ranch,
and back in the day it was very

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:90%
isolated.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Even the driveway to get to
the ranch house was over a mile

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has it
always been 60 acres?

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: No, it's been parceled
down throughout the decades.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it was
much larger then.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And back in the mid to late '70s
there was nothing really around

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So it was over a few
hundred acres at the time.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And it sits really high
in the town of Kiowa.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest
elevation out there.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So it does have
a high elevation.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
It's right there in
the Palmer Divide,

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and you can see Pike's
Peak off in the distance.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really
beautiful location.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.830 align:middle line:84%
But the history of the
property goes back a long time.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And trying to figure out
if the activity predated

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.460 align:middle line:84%
the military presence, I
found out that the homestead,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:84%
it was known as the Mulligan
Ranch, and then the Baker Ranch.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:90%
So the Mulligan's and--

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: These are the owners?

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, these were the
previous owners of the ranch

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:90%
before our family got there.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Mulligan's is
really interesting.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
There was a gentleman by
the name of Dick Mulligan,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and he was born and raised
on this ranch property,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and later in his life
he became the caretaker

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:90%
for Winter Park Ski Resort.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you google
his name, it'll

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
say Dick Mulligan had the gift
of gab and bold exaggeration.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking oh,
I think he was trying

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:84%
to tell people what was
happening back in the day of all

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.240 align:middle line:90%
the strange things.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and nobody believed him.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.473 align:middle line:84%
So the history goes
back quite a long ways.

00:04:03.473 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And then the Bakers who owned
it after that, it sat vacant

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.970 align:middle line:84%
for 10 years, and then
the Bakers purchased it.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
They left the ranch
property so suddenly

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
that they left the keys in
the ignition of their truck.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And they said there was a
building on this ranch property,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:90%
and it vanished.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
They left a lot of
their belongings

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
there and just
left the property.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And then it sat vacant
for another 10 years.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And then my mother started
dating a gentleman that

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
owned the property for
those high strangeness years

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:84%
when I had my experiences there,
along with my sister and others

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:90%
on the ranch property.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you
categorize the ranch, Katie,

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:90%
in terms of paranormal?

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Is it haunted, bizarre, strange?

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:90%
What would you say?

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I would say
it's the trifecta of.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have--

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of them?

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: All of them.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.498 align:middle line:90%
We have the cryptids.

00:04:47.498 --> 00:04:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So there were what they
called white fuzzies back

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:84%
in the day or these gray-haired,
like Sasquatch creatures that

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:90%
were seen out there.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:84%
We had paranormal activity
going on, not only there,

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:84%
but I also had it follow
me to where I lived.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:90%
So I only visited the ranch.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.200 align:middle line:90%
My mom was dating the gentleman.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Their two youngest son lived
with us during the week,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.242 align:middle line:84%
so I would visit the
ranch on the weekends,

00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
so I did not live
there full time.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So the activity,
the paranormal stuff

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
kind of followed me home to my
house in Englewood, at the time,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:90%
and still does to this day.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Kind of, I have a lot
of those ghostly things

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:90%
happen to me all the time.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:84%
But we also had, the cryptids,
the paranormal stuff.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:84%
We had the UFO and
the orb activity

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.870 align:middle line:84%
out there as well, and then
the military side of it.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's these blacked out
helicopters and things

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
ever scared there?

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Oh, yeah as a little
girl, I was very scared.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, yes.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give us a story or two.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, the scariest
night on the ranch for us,

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:84%
it was the boy's
mother's birthday.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a weekend,
we were visiting,

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle line:84%
the adults were playing board
games in the front room.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.460 align:middle line:84%
My sister, myself,
and the three boys

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
were in the back room
just hanging out,

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:84%
being teenagers, and
kids or whatever.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the very first things
that was reported on this ranch

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:90%
were these strange hum sounds.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they would get
so loud that you couldn't

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:90%
hear each other speak over it.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were always
trying to figure out,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:84%
where are these strange
hums coming from?

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:90%
What are these strange noises?

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And any time these
hums would start up,

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
unusual things would start to
happen on the ranch property.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
This particular night,
the hum started up.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:84%
All the power in
the house goes out,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:84%
so we're all like, oh my gosh,
we need flashlights, candles,

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.690 align:middle line:84%
we're already scared
and freaked out.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I saw the brightest light I've
ever seen out of that window.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And at that point
in time, we heard

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:84%
this disembodied, electrical
sounding voice out

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:90%
of every orifice of the house.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
interesting about this,

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:84%
my sister and I remember
this and my mother,

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:84%
but in the APRO report
is the exact quote that

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.060 align:middle line:84%
says, "Attention, we have
allowed you to remain.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.880 align:middle line:84%
We have interfered with
your lives very little.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Do not cause us to take
action which you will regret.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Your friends will be instructed
to remain silent concerning us."

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
We were the friends,
so we were threatened

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and warned not to talk about
what was happening there.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.968 align:middle line:84%
And I know that quote, because
it was in the APRO report,

00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:00.760 align:middle line:84%
the Aerial Phenomena
Research Organization.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who was
sending those messages?

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, for a long
time, that was a big question.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, where
did this come from?

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:14.310 align:middle line:84%
In my research, George, my
theory is that back in the mid

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.030 align:middle line:84%
to late '70s, perhaps they were
experimenting with some new

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:84%
technologies, some
laser technologies,

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:22.810 align:middle line:90%
arrays underground.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But I found something called
plasma ball technology.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And this plasma ball technology,
they were experimenting

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.390 align:middle line:84%
with that kind of pipes,
human sounding voice out

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:90%
into the field.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in
battle, you don't

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.920 align:middle line:84%
have to put your men and women
out there and risk their lives.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:84%
You can pipe out this
human sounding voice.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard this
for the first time,

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:84%
it sounded like the
voice I heard when

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.900 align:middle line:90%
I was a child on that ranch.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, were they
experimenting with plasma ball

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:90%
technology out there?

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think that's
where I'm leaning

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:90%
on that particular event.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
However, that doesn't
explain the big bright light.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
We didn't hear
helicopter noises.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't explain
the paranormal types

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:90%
of things that's going on.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.321 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always left with a
back and forth, kind of.

00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:08.702 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Katie, might
it be hallowed ground--

00:08:08.702 --> 00:08:09.535 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I think so.

00:08:09.535 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --from like, hundreds
and hundreds of years ago.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: For sure.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:90%
That's a very nomadic land.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We have a history of
many tribes out there,

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:23.850 align:middle line:84%
from the Cheyenne, the Ute, the
Comanche, the Pawnee, the Kiowa,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and so very much
sacred spots out there.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we have
the family of the Hungates.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:84%
So the Hungate family
lived in Kiowa, Colorado.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.549 align:middle line:84%
They were massacred
by a Native tribe.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.299 align:middle line:84%
They were taken down to the
city of Denver, put in right

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.020 align:middle line:90%
out front of the State Capitol.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:84%
That was the impetus for the
horrific Sand Creek Massacre

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
event out there,
which was horrific.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there were a lot of
very traumatic things that

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:90%
happened in that whole area.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder
sometimes if the land,

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and the water, and the
streams, holds that energy.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure, but that's
something I certainly consider.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.357 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something, Katie,

00:09:03.357 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:84%
called the circle in the
snow about a landing site.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.040 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: When my sister
and I visited the ranch

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.382 align:middle line:84%
on a particular weekend, it
was a typical Colorado spring

00:09:14.382 --> 00:09:16.340 align:middle line:84%
day where we had wet,
heavy snow on the ground,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.340 align:middle line:90%
but the sun was shining.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:90%
It was a beautiful day.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.922 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to go
flip the Frisbee out

00:09:20.922 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:84%
in front of the ranch house,
and we looked down at our feet

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and there was this
large snowless circle

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:84%
on the ground where it
was completely dry dirt,

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:90%
nothing grew.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And on the outside
was wet, heavy snow.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.960 align:middle line:84%
It was just a really
strange experience.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And then fast forward
we get the APRO report

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and in it, it talks about
seeing this large snow circle.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.770 align:middle line:84%
The investigators, there were
three PhDs on the property--

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:84%
John Durr, PhD, Peter
Vanarsdall, PhD,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.360 align:middle line:90%
and Dr. Leo Sprinkle, PhD.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.095 align:middle line:90%
They measured the snow circle.

00:09:48.095 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All experts?

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.095 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, all experts.

00:09:50.095 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:84%
It was 75 feet in diameter,
and in that report

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
it mentions drops
of blood in the snow

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:90%
outside the snowless circle.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.800 align:middle line:84%
It also mentioned two snowless
circles on the property.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about
that, just recently

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.985 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking back into
and investigating--

00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:84%
The Rocky Mountain
Ranch Research

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
is investigating
the Carl Higdon case

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
from 1974 out of
Rollins, Wyoming.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about the snow circle.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I've been researching, and I was
just invited at the King Ranch

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.920 align:middle line:84%
where Snippy the horse
was mutilated in 1967.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And in the Snippy
the horse case,

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:84%
they had these indentations in a
circle around Snippy the horse,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.225 align:middle line:90%
and it measured 75 feet--

00:10:27.225 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a landing site?

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.708 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Like a landing site.

00:10:29.708 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And it also measured
75 feet in diameter.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's something
to that 75 feet in diameter.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is bizarre.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Right,
it's really strange.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had an
experience in 1976

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:84%
with what is called
the strange box.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: That's kind of my
area of focus right now,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:84%
are these strange,
mysterious boxes.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:84%
They're so unusual,
and I didn't like

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
to talk about them for a
while because people are like,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:90%
what are you even talking about?

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:84%
But in the APRO report, I
had experience with this box

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:84%
In the daytime, me and
my mother's boyfriend

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and the youngest son
were in a pickup truck.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:84%
It was during the day we went
out behind the ranch house

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's filled with Ponderosa
pines, this big wooded forest.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:84%
We got something
out of the shed.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:84%
We get in the pickup truck
and we're driving around,

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and this electrical sounding
like, almost like a bee sound,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
we hear it.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
He stops the truck and
he's like, it's the box,

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:90%
it's the box.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
This box, it was a black box,
it had lights inside of it,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.405 align:middle line:84%
it was off the ground,
maybe 3 and 1/2, 4 feet.

00:11:31.405 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, it's
just hovering there.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Turn around, and the
thing disappeared.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.400 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about that
is-- we jumped in the truck

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:90%
and we take off.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:90%
It was very frightening.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
But the undersheriff, Bill
Waugh, who's in the report,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.930 align:middle line:84%
states that he had an experience
with the same similar kind

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:90%
of a black box.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't want to
approach it alone.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So he goes and gets
a posse sheriff,

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and they go back to where
the box was located,

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and he said the box seemed
to go down under the ground

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:90%
along with the tree.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:90%
It's in the report.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Other adults also have
witnessed this strange box.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So one case, I'm looking at
that has a box encounter, also,

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.570 align:middle line:84%
is the Carl Higdon case out
of Rollins, Wyoming from 1974,

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.780 align:middle line:84%
kind of around the same time
of the boxes in Elbert County.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And Carl Higdon, who
was an elk hunter,

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
was out elk hunting in
Medicine Bow National Forest,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:84%
sees a big bull
elk, takes a shot,

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
sees his bullet
go in slow motion,

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:31.420 align:middle line:84%
hits like an invisible
force, kind of

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:84%
like at the ranch,
the bullet drops,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and he has this encounter
with Ausso One, this ET,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and he claims to go
into this big box.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Also, my good friend Trey Hudson
has had a similar encounter

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.060 align:middle line:84%
with a box at The Meadows, which
is another high strangeness

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:90%
location down South.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Katie, you
gave us a video clip

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
of you returning back to
the location of that spot

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:90%
where you found the box.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: So right
here, I think, is

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:90%
where he pulled the truck over.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Stop right here a minute.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MAN: Right here.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: The box would--

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I got to get out.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing to me.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:90%
The box, this is it.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.735 align:middle line:90%
You have the truck here.

00:13:16.735 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:90%
It would have been right there.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.565 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:13:24.565 --> 00:13:33.572 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.572 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Here, this is it.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:90%
This is where I saw it.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.220 align:middle line:90%
It was off the ground.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.170 align:middle line:90%
My hand is shaking right now.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:90%
I was like, standing here-ish.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:90%
That's how far away it was.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
being over here.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Jack was screaming, it's
the box, it's the box.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And it sounded like it
was going, [VOCALIZES].

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember him, get
in the truck, get in the truck,

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:90%
get in the truck.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And we were jumping in the back
of the truck and he took off.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.292 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think that box was?

00:14:06.292 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I'm
starting, the more I'm

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%
looking into these
strange boxes.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I think in my
particular case, it

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
might have been something
we were experimenting,

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:18.480 align:middle line:84%
meaning we Black Access projects
along with the plasma ball

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:90%
lightning.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think it was ours?

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Maybe, perhaps.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or theirs?

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I think the box,
like in the Higdon case,

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps the box that
was seen in The Meadows

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:90%
maybe was theirs.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But this particular
box might have

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:84%
been something we were trying
to back engineer from something.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, it just seems to
be a little different than some

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.640 align:middle line:90%
of these other box encounters.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:84%
However, that being
said, we do even

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.670 align:middle line:84%
have boxes that are seen flying
and hovering in other reports.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just trying to
gobble up all the box

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:90%
reports that I can find.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And antiquity had
artwork that depicted

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:84%
square, rectangular things
flying in our skies.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Are they communication devices?

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.312 align:middle line:84%
Did it have something
to do with the cattle

00:15:02.312 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:84%
mutilations that were going
on at such a high degree?

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or all of the above.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Or all of the above.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I really don't know.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:90%
It's so mysterious.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the story of
the tall Nordic ETs in the box?

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.655 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, that's
an interesting part--

00:15:14.655 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened there?

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: --of this
whole phenomenon.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I personally
didn't have an encounter

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that I can remember
anyway, but several

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.450 align:middle line:84%
of the adults on
the property claim

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.313 align:middle line:84%
to have interacted with
two types of beings.

00:15:27.313 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you trust them?

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I do trust them, I do.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Though, one gentleman, I
think is very interesting,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.800 align:middle line:84%
he has an Air Force
military background,

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and I wonder if he was
involved in some of the MKUltra

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.240 align:middle line:90%
kind of experiments.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
He talks about bringing vagrants
and people onto the property.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Were they doing some
mind control experiments?

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.360 align:middle line:84%
We have documentation
of a gentleman

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:84%
named Warren and his last
name is redacted out.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Visits the ranch, felt
something take over his mind,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:84%
would release him,
he would run back.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So I question, like maybe he was
involved with some Black Access

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.330 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But other adults in the
situation I do trust implicitly.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.993 align:middle line:84%
But they had claimed
they had encounters

00:16:09.993 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:84%
with these
extraterrestrials, that there

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:84%
were two types, that they were
in conflict with one another.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Katie, let's
look at a couple sketches

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle line:90%
of what we call the tubby guys.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what we're looking at.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And then tell us, what
does it mean, tubby?

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:10%
>>PAIGE: Right, it's
a fun nickname that

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:10%
just came about recently from
a podcast I did with a rather

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.460 align:middle line:10%
famous person, and he
dubbed them, tubby guys,

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.690 align:middle line:10%
and the name kind of stuck.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But for obvious reasons, they
have these tubes that came out.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
These three tubes came from this
apparatus on the front of them.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:84%
They had long, skinny, spindly
arms, long skinny legs,

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.060 align:middle line:84%
this protective shield
over their chest.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:84%
They had a heavy brow with
wrinkles on the forehead.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:54.073 align:middle line:84%
These larger than our
eyes and then these noses

00:16:54.073 --> 00:16:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and the wrinkles
around the mouth.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:10%
Now, what's interesting
about the image on the left.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.300 align:middle line:10%
This is from a gentleman
named Sean Bartok, who

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:10%
lived 14 miles away
from where the ranch is.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:10%
And we didn't know each other.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:10%
And I went to one of
his presentations,

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.140 align:middle line:10%
and that is a sketch of the
beings he saw on his property.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said the tubes in
the neck actually come out

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.019 align:middle line:84%
like the one from the Elbert
County Ranch or the Rocky

00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:90%
Mountain Ranch.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:20.736 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --coming out
of the one on the right.

00:17:20.736 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:10%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, so the one
with the tubes on the outside

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:10%
is from our property,
Rocky Mountain Ranch.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.510 align:middle line:10%
And the other one with
the tubes in the neck

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:10%
is from another ranch
property 14 miles away.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Looks like it
could be a breathing device.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, isn't
that interesting?

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, some sort of
apparatus like that.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.260 align:middle line:10%
So there he is with those
long, skinny, spindly arms.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.950 align:middle line:10%
And one day I was standing
in the grocery store

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:10%
and there was a magazine
talking about the future of AI,

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.780 align:middle line:10%
and I'm like, oh my
goodness, could that

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:10%
be what tubby guy
is on the ranch?

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Was he some sort of AI
hybrid type of being?

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He doesn't look human.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:10%
>>PAIGE: No, he doesn't.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:10%
And were they in conflict
with the Nordics?

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:10%
Maybe the Nordics don't want
us to go down a certain path

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.740 align:middle line:10%
and an AI tubby guy does.

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what
the conflict is,

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:84%
but that's what was
reported in the report.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:10%
And again, the sketch
on the right there

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:10%
with the tubes on the outside is
from Sean Bartok, 14 miles away,

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:16.630 align:middle line:10%
and we didn't know each other.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:10%
So I just found that to
be more than coincidence

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.657 align:middle line:10%
that we had such similar
beings represented in sketches.

00:18:23.657 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, another
creature, Katie,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:84%
that they talked about was
called the white fuzzies.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.305 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:18:30.305 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: The white fuzzies are
a Sasquatch creature that we're

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
seen out there on the ranch,
which is also interesting

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:84%
because this area
like we talked about,

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:84%
is very open and ranchy
with these patches

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:90%
of Ponderosa pines.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So if we had a Sasquatch
can't live there full time.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So to me, they must be
interdimensional or coming

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.227 align:middle line:84%
up and down from underground
or I don't know what,

00:18:51.227 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:90%
but they were seen after--

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --a picture
that you sent us of this.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.495 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: This was
the sketch that

00:18:55.495 --> 00:18:57.620 align:middle line:84%
was in the APRO report
of the Sasquatch

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:90%
out there were the white fuzzy.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
They were large and
had this gray hair.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And later on, I received
an email from Bob Salas,

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and they claimed that the
airmen stationed at Malmstrom

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
in Montana had very similar
encounters with these same type

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:90%
of creatures.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.438 align:middle line:84%
The drawings look
almost identical.

00:19:15.438 --> 00:19:17.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How tall do
they describe this?

00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: 8 feet.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, 8 feet.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's typical Bigfoot.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, typical,
and in the upper report

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.170 align:middle line:84%
too, they say they actually
on the barbed wire fence.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:84%
They actually got
some of the hairs

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and had it tested
and sent to a lab.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And it came back as
an unknown species

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.578 align:middle line:84%
where that information
is now, I have no idea.

00:19:34.578 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I would love to get
my hands on that.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.537 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So a lot
of creepy things

00:19:37.537 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:90%
have been going on this ranch.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yes, very much so.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about John Duke.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, so
John Duke, he was

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:84%
kind of the main protagonist
at the ranch at the time.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:84%
He was the gentleman that has
a very mysterious background

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:84%
with the Air Force and the
report, if you read it,

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.355 align:middle line:84%
some of his claims are
pretty like outlandish.

00:19:56.355 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I have my suspicions that he
was part of the MKUltra program

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:05.380 align:middle line:84%
because he talks about, in the
report, experimenting with LSD.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:10.175 align:middle line:84%
And in parentheses, it says
legal, which makes me think--

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was sanctioned.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.883 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, it was sanctioned
for him to be doing that, so.

00:20:13.883 --> 00:20:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had an encounter
with one of these white fuzzies,

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:90%
too?

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: He did.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.430 align:middle line:84%
If it was just John
Duke's testimony,

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I might write all this
off and I wouldn't even

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.820 align:middle line:90%
be doing what I'm doing.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But this has affected
so many other people

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:90%
that I deem really credible.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:84%
John Duke, I had my questions
about and my suspicions about.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
But there were so
many other adults,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.980 align:middle line:84%
including my mother, my
mother's boyfriend, my sister

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and I, the boys, neighbors,
people in the community.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And not only just in that
one town, but the whole town

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:90%
of Elbert County.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.970 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
so many people that

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:84%
have experienced and witnessed
very similar type of events.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What can you
conclude at this point?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:10%
>>PAIGE: Well, where
I stand right now,

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:10%
I don't think it's
an all or nothing.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.470 align:middle line:10%
I think that both things
were going on in my research.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this
activity, the orbs, the craft

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:84%
line on and off the property,
the paranormal type of things.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I think this was
going on for decades

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:90%
before it was ever reported.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.682 align:middle line:84%
And then possibly this
ranch had a target on it.

00:21:19.682 --> 00:21:21.640 align:middle line:84%
We know all these strange
things are happening.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:84%
The mutilations kicked
up not only of cow

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.190 align:middle line:90%
but of horse, dog, sheep.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So we had this
rash of mutilations

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:90%
happening at the time.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think the military
learned of this area

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and started doing some
Black Access projects there.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's this area where
both of these kind of things

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:84%
cross paths where you
have both Black access

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:90%
experiments and the unknown.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The APRO reports,
tell us more about that?

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: The APRO
report for me, it

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.320 align:middle line:84%
was given to me by John
Schuessler, who is a local here

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
in Colorado and one of the
founding fathers of MUFON,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:90%
the Mutual UFO Network.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And when he learned of my
involvement with the ranch,

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
he quickly bestowed upon me
the original briefing document

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:90%
that he had on the report.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And for me, and for my
older sister and my family,

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:84%
first of all, we never knew
anybody knew anything about it

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:84%
or that it was
ever investigated.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So just seeing that
report, to know

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that somebody else knew about
what was happening out there

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:90%
was amazing to me.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And just to see the quote
from that scary night,

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.370 align:middle line:84%
the attention quote was in
that APRO report, the circle

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.630 align:middle line:84%
that I remembered was
in the APRO report.

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was
just, I want to say

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:84%
it was like 32 different
events that happened out there

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.007 align:middle line:84%
from big cone-shaped
UFOs to the Sasquatch.

00:22:39.007 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It never stopped.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: It never stopped.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:90%
The boxes are in there as well.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.513 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
police activity out there.

00:22:44.513 --> 00:22:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Were they ever
summoned out there?

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, a lot.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I went just recently,
flew to Florida

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
to do an interview
with Bill Waugh

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:90%
widow, Jean and his son Keith.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And I got to learn a lot
about behind the scenes, what

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:90%
was happening with the Sheriff.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So there was Sheriff George
Yarnell and Undersheriff Bill

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Waugh, and according to Bill
Waugh's family in the police

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:84%
station, there in the
town, they had a big map,

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and they were really pinning
where all these mutilations were

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So we would have one in Elbert
County and one in Montana kind

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:18.640 align:middle line:90%
of happening at the same time.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were tracking
the locations, the times.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:84%
During this two,
George, we had these

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.425 align:middle line:84%
blacked out helicopters, these
mysterious copters going on.

00:23:26.425 --> 00:23:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: So all
this was going on.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And then Bill
Waugh's family also

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.278 align:middle line:84%
had the paranormal type
things going on in their home.

00:23:33.278 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he credible?

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.778 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: He was
very credible, yes.

00:23:35.778 --> 00:23:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They were flying over in
airplanes all the time,

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:84%
trying to spot
things in the sky.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.292 align:middle line:84%
He had his own encounter,
so he very much

00:23:42.292 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:84%
believed there was
something very unusual

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:90%
going on there in Elbert County.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you got the
police doing one thing.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
government doing another.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.990 align:middle line:90%
What about private citizens?

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, I think
the private citizens

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:90%
were getting really frightened.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:84%
The Cattlemen's Association at
the time had a $10,000 reward

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.480 align:middle line:84%
to try and catch the
perpetrators of what was

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.280 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:84%
They actually
issued a no-fly zone

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:08.310 align:middle line:84%
over the county to try and
monitor what was happening.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I think they
were arming themselves.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:84%
They were quite
frightened, whatever

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.150 align:middle line:84%
was happening was going
to go to humans next.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So everybody was really
on edge for several years

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.440 align:middle line:84%
because this went on for
several years out there.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there many
cattle mutilations out there?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Hundreds, almost daily.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hundreds?

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Hundreds.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I have a folder this
thick with newspaper articles

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:90%
from back in the day.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, it wasn't just
cow, it was horse, sheep, dog.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.400 align:middle line:84%
The whole town and even
the Colorado Bureau

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.720 align:middle line:84%
of Investigations
was involved in this.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.042 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was Sheila?

00:24:43.042 --> 00:24:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, Sheila
is a great witness.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Her family pioneered the town.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:84%
They have roads
named after them.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:49.830 align:middle line:90%
She lives in Wyoming now.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I drove out there and did
an interview with her.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Her and her husband
owned property

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:84%
in Ramah, which is very
close to where the ranch was,

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and her husband was
out on his horse,

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:90%
checking the cows for calves.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.570 align:middle line:84%
He came across a dead
calf on the ground

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and it had four
incisions cut in a square

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:84%
with the top of the fur
removed, but the skin was there.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So he gets on the
horse, goes back

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.760 align:middle line:90%
and gets my witness, Sheila.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:84%
They drive back in
the pickup truck,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.460 align:middle line:84%
took them about 20,
25 minutes to get back

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and that calf was mutilated--
cauterized, blood drained,

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.960 align:middle line:90%
organs removed.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:90%
There's the picture.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is pretty graphic.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.200 align:middle line:84%
The image on the
right shows what

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.060 align:middle line:84%
it looks like when a coyote
jumps on and starts ripping out

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:32.860 align:middle line:90%
a calf.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This
thing is mutilated.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.537 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, the
one on the left

00:25:35.537 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:84%
with the cauterized incision,
is that actual calf.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:90%
She sent me that picture.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:90%
She had the original photo.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So that calf had the
cut of four incisions.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And then when they got
back, it looked like this.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting, this
was miles off the county road.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.775 align:middle line:84%
No helicopter sounds, no
footprints around the calf,

00:25:54.775 --> 00:25:55.575 align:middle line:90%
only the horse--

00:25:55.575 --> 00:25:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --its legs
on the right side?

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yes, it is.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And they felt like
it was really eerie

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and they felt like they
were being watched.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.182 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And where's the blood?

00:26:04.182 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, no blood.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.730 align:middle line:90%
A lot of these mutilations.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
You will not have blood
around the animals.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Other animals or
predators will not

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:90%
go near these mutilated animals.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.510 align:middle line:84%
There's this weird
cone of silence

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.320 align:middle line:84%
that happens around
these mutilations.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really strange.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
paranormal events, Katie,

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:90%
that were also called in?

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Just you name it, all
your typical things being moved.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Almost like a trickster,
trickster thing.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:90%
You'd be working on something.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It's there one minute it
shows up someplace unusual.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Your typical footsteps,
light anomalies,

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:84%
electrical malfunctions,
those types of things.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
the shadow figures

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.575 align:middle line:84%
that are often seen around these
high strangeness locations.

00:26:47.575 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:84%
They seem to have
this hitchhiker

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:50.490 align:middle line:90%
effect that follow you around.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly encountered
that as a young girl.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
years went by from you

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.520 align:middle line:84%
being a kid to coming back as
an adult to look at the ranch?

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I have to
give away my age.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, like so many
of us, we go through,

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:07.020 align:middle line:84%
we get married, go to school,
have careers, raise our kids.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.630 align:middle line:84%
But all these experiences
never really left me.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.830 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't until the early
2000s that I started delving

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.132 align:middle line:90%
back into what was happening.

00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I had so many
unanswered questions.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --years.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, 35 years.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there a
difference when you went back?

00:27:21.283 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: First
time back, I didn't

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:84%
know how I was going to
react, and my reaction

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.050 align:middle line:90%
to going back even surprised me.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I felt empowered as an adult. I
was in that scared little girl

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.050 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like I've been
investigating this for 12 years.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I was anxious to talk with
the owners that live there now

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and kind of hear what's been
going on, the past 30-plus

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.842 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I felt
empowered going back.

00:27:43.842 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I still wouldn't go out
there at night, though.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.600 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.697 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did the new owners
say about what's happening now?

00:27:49.697 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: It's interesting.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a mixed bag.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I feel like Nicole has
seen these shadowy figures

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.810 align:middle line:84%
in the woods, some
balls of light,

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:84%
creatures in the old
part of the house.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So they have had their own,
They have these strange--

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:90%
in the pond.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's their
daughter, Nicole?

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, the daughter.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: And unfortunately,
the mother passed away a year

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:90%
and a half ago that lives there.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And the gentleman that owns
it now, he's a tinkerer.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:84%
He's always busy
working on things.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But I think more
and more I think

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.290 align:middle line:84%
he's been enlightened
to what's been going on

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:21.467 align:middle line:90%
and he's more aware of it.

00:28:21.467 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think more and more things
are starting to happen to him.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does he
continue to stay out there?

00:28:26.075 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: He loves it there.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.117 align:middle line:90%
The whole family does.

00:28:28.117 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
kind of felt like I

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.700 align:middle line:84%
don't want to make their home
seem like a scary place with all

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.800 align:middle line:84%
the history of that property,
because that is their home.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And they've lived there
for many, many, many years,

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and they have very good
experiences there as well.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:90%
So again, mixed bag, you know.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are cattle mutilations
still occurring out there?

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: There are, there are.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.175 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, bizarre.

00:28:50.175 --> 00:28:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, in talking with
the locals, there was one a year

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and a half ago, just
really close to Elbert.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
gentleman named Carl.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:84%
He's in a lot of these
old historic papers.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I did an interview with
him, and interestingly, he

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.360 align:middle line:84%
has cattle that he raises
in Woodland Park, Colorado,

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:90%
as well as Elbert County.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And for the last three fourth
of July's in Woodland Park,

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:15.203 align:middle line:84%
he's had three mutilated
cattle, one each year up in--

00:29:15.203 --> 00:29:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you mentioned
Linda Moulton Howe.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah,
Linda Moulton Howe.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.193 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think her first book
was called A Strange Harvest.

00:29:20.193 --> 00:29:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: That's right.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.910 align:middle line:90%
That's her film.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About that?

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Exactly.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and we're
communicating a little bit

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:84%
because it seems like
things are picking up again.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.850 align:middle line:84%
These mutilations are starting
to ramp back up again.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.475 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Shadowy
figures you mentioned.

00:29:34.475 --> 00:29:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Mm-hmm.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What were they?

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I don't
know what they are,

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.930 align:middle line:84%
but I was quite frightened
of them as a little girl

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.140 align:middle line:90%
and would never sleep alone.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I always slept with big
sister, over put my head

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:45.160 align:middle line:90%
under the covers.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But they would stand right
to the side of my bed

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.572 align:middle line:90%
or inside the doorway.

00:29:48.572 --> 00:29:49.780 align:middle line:90%
You'd just see them kind of--

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They never hurt you?

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: No, not to
my knowledge, no.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you abducted?

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I don't believe so.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had
a past life regression?

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.832 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I have not, I have not.

00:30:00.832 --> 00:30:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You might
want to do that.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:04.248 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, that would
be interesting to do.

00:30:04.248 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did
you go back there?

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I think I wanted
to face what happened.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.150 align:middle line:84%
I have so many
unanswered questions,

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.640 align:middle line:90%
and I'm such a curious mind.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.750 align:middle line:90%
And I want answers.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And I love documents, and
research, and digging.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And once I opened this
box of all these trifecta

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.050 align:middle line:84%
of encounters, I
think for me, it's

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:84%
been about talking
with other people who

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.020 align:middle line:84%
had similar experiences,
because I felt really alone

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.530 align:middle line:90%
and isolated as a young girl.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.220 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't talk about it.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.400 align:middle line:84%
You question like,
what's going on.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's been
so wonderful to talk

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.407 align:middle line:84%
with other people about their
experiences and in that--

00:30:43.407 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which similar to yours.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, that
are similar to mine.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, good,
I'm not alone in this.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:90%
And this is still happening.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.337 align:middle line:84%
And now we can talk about
these things that are going on.

00:30:52.337 --> 00:30:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You continue to
go back there, obviously.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.652 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I do, I do.

00:30:56.652 --> 00:30:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Especially around
this landing site

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.080 align:middle line:84%
where the circle is we
brought the drone up

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and within under two minutes,
the battery went from 100% down

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:90%
to nothing.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.510 align:middle line:90%
We charged it--

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Drained?

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, strange.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:84%
We charged it, brought it back
up, and it was fine again.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's just some weird,
anomalous kind of waves of I

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.110 align:middle line:84%
don't know what's happening,
but when I do go out there,

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.310 align:middle line:90%
it's always in the daytime.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
do you go there?

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.183 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I try to get back every
once, every couple of months,

00:31:22.183 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:84%
but I think I want to make my
visits more frequent for sure.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it bring
back strange memories?

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: It does.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely does.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And for my sister as well, I was
able to go back with my sister

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.288 align:middle line:84%
and that was really good to go
back the two of us together.

00:31:36.288 --> 00:31:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
brought a priest out there

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:39.475 align:middle line:90%
and blessed the place?

00:31:39.475 --> 00:31:40.965 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I haven't, I have not.

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I want to do that.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah,
that would be nice.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it feel like
there's evil out there?

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: It definitely,
is funny you mention that.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Because visiting Blind Frog
and these other ranch locations

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.960 align:middle line:84%
out in Utah, I wanted to
feel intuitively how it felt.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.698 align:middle line:84%
Because from when I was younger,
it felt very heavy and scary

00:32:00.698 --> 00:32:02.240 align:middle line:84%
there, and I wanted
to see if I still

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:84%
felt that way or that
sensation of being watched.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are
certain areas still,

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.200 align:middle line:84%
even when I'm driving around
through Elbert County,

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.250 align:middle line:84%
there are certain areas
where I get that same feeling

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.280 align:middle line:90%
of heaviness back.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wouldn't necessarily
call it evil, but is this--

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is a doom?

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: It's Friday
the 13th, it's doom.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessarily doom.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:84%
It just feels like whatever's
there is aware of your presence.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say whether
it's positive or negative,

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.107 align:middle line:90%
but there's an awareness there.

00:32:33.107 --> 00:32:34.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what it feels like.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close does this
ranch, the Rocky Mountain Ranch,

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:90%
echo Skinwalker?

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Very closely from the
mysterious military presence

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:46.370 align:middle line:84%
in blackout helicopters to the
mutilations, to the paranormal,

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:84%
to the strange sounds, the
humming, crypto creatures,

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's very, very
similar to that.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the
name Bob Bigelow?

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I do.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is his
involvement with this?

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.372 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, that's
an interesting thing.

00:33:00.372 --> 00:33:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So just recently it's coming
out that Bob Bigelow owned

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:84%
both the Skinwalker Ranch
and the Mount Wilson Ranch,

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.450 align:middle line:90%
owned now by Jeff MacBurnie.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.430 align:middle line:84%
We just recently did a
couple visits out there

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.280 align:middle line:84%
at the Mount Wilson Ranch,
and we have this whole host

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.500 align:middle line:84%
of people that
were investigating

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.472 align:middle line:84%
both the Skinwalker Ranch
and Mount Wilson Ranch.

00:33:17.472 --> 00:33:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting about
the Mount Wilson Ranch and Bob

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Bigelow, there's a
Howard Hughes connection.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So Howard Hughes had
a runway really close

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.625 align:middle line:90%
to the Mount Wilson Ranch.

00:33:26.625 --> 00:33:27.425 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:33:27.425 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: And he owned
all of Pioche, Nevada.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So they're digging up strange
artifacts from under the ground.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.915 align:middle line:84%
So there could be
secret, I don't

00:33:34.915 --> 00:33:37.290 align:middle line:84%
know what's hidden underground
at the Mount Wilson Ranch.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And where the Rocky
Mountain Ranch kind of

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.700 align:middle line:84%
fits into the Skinwalker
and Mount Wilson,

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it predated those
by over a decade and a half.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And maybe some of these Black
Access projects and experiments

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.900 align:middle line:84%
started out here at
Rocky Mountain Ranch.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And then Bob Bigelow came
in and got the Skinwalker

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Ranch and the Mount Wilson Ranch
and continued the work there.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.930 align:middle line:84%
But certainly we know
Linda Moulton Howe was

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.360 align:middle line:84%
aware of the Rocky Mountain
Ranch as well as Dr. Leo

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Sprinkle, and they
were also there present

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.949 align:middle line:84%
at Mount Wilson and
the Skinwalker Ranch.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned
the daughter, Nicole.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.690 align:middle line:84%
What similarities did you
two have out that way?

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:16.199 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, it was a really
great connecting with Nicole,

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:84%
because I just wanted to
give her a hug and like,

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.050 align:middle line:84%
I know what you're
going through.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:22.008 align:middle line:84%
She had the sense of
being watched all the time

00:34:22.008 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:90%
like I did as a kid.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:25.170 align:middle line:90%
The shadow figures in her room.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:28.130 align:middle line:84%
She was really uneasy, as
if eyes were watching them

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.870 align:middle line:84%
from the wood line, the tree
line at the ranch house.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps it's the
Sasquatch creature.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.080 align:middle line:84%
One thing that happened when
I revisited the ranch just

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.010 align:middle line:84%
recently, it was
a very snow, snow

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.719 align:middle line:90%
falling really heavy and fast.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:43.219 align:middle line:84%
And we go over the
barbed wire fence

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and out of the
blanket of snow come

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.389 align:middle line:84%
these bipedal large
footprints, one

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:50.800 align:middle line:84%
in front of the other, pretty
wide stride for like 12

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.197 align:middle line:84%
or 15 feet, then they
disappeared for another--

00:34:53.197 --> 00:34:54.989 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean they disappeared?

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: They just
disappeared, no tracks,

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and then they reappeared
for like another 6 to 8 feet

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.200 align:middle line:90%
and then disappeared again.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like the thing jumped?

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.792 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: It's like it came up--

00:35:02.792 --> 00:35:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I think something came
up from underground,

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:08.760 align:middle line:84%
walked, disappeared, came up,
walked, and disappeared again.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.918 align:middle line:84%
I think it was one
of the white fuzzies.

00:35:10.918 --> 00:35:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --portal or something?

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah,
something like that.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.940 align:middle line:90%
And to witness that was amazing.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you also
found a handprint?

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, the
handprint was on my back.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I got, like a radiation
burn on my shoulder.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.523 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was on your back?

00:35:22.523 --> 00:35:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: On my back.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A handprint
on your back?

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:28.530 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it is.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: There it is.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you feel that?

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I did not.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And that was the night of
the snowstorm when I had

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:90%
several layers of clothes on.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So I had a hoodie, a
sweater, a shirt, a vest.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I was freezing, it
was really cold.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, it just my
shoulder started bothering me

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and my daughter, like,
mom, what happened?

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And that first night
back on the ranch.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.250 align:middle line:84%
It was hot to the
touch and it blistered.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's a radiation
burn or what that is, but to me

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.182 align:middle line:84%
it almost looks like three, like
almost a handprint on my back.

00:36:00.182 --> 00:36:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And I had several
layers of clothes

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.348 align:middle line:84%
on, so I have no
idea what that is.

00:36:04.348 --> 00:36:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're not prone
to rashes or anything, are you?

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:08.365 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: No, nope.

00:36:08.365 --> 00:36:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, bizarre.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: No.

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:11.538 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
the dead creatures

00:36:11.538 --> 00:36:13.372 align:middle line:90%
from Mexico found at the pond.

00:36:13.372 --> 00:36:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, that's
really interesting.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened there?

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: There's a little
pond on the property,

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.610 align:middle line:90%
and most times it's dried out.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:23.640 align:middle line:84%
In the APRO report,
they talk about

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.830 align:middle line:84%
not only the white fuzzies
and the Sasquatch creatures,

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:29.310 align:middle line:84%
but other cryptid creatures
that were seen and reported

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:84%
on this property, anywhere
from large birds like phoenixes

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:36.820 align:middle line:84%
to these weird,
platypus-type creatures.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And when I was just
recently back to the ranch,

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:40.810 align:middle line:90%
there was water.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:44.800 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of rain this year
and the pond was filled up.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And one day he goes out and
there's all these dead creatures

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:middle line:90%
laying around the pond.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many?

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.033 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: And then,
I want to say,

00:36:51.033 --> 00:36:53.200 align:middle line:84%
when he showed me the
photograph, there were-- well,

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.650 align:middle line:84%
there's a few there, but there
were just all laying dead around

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:55.980 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.263 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:36:57.263 --> 00:36:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: They're not
Native to Colorado.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're a
creature from New Mexico.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, this pond is
mostly dry, so very strange.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:84%
They were all dead
around the pond

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's really close
to the landing site.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So this pond is super
close to that landing site.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I'd like to
say about the landing site,

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.840 align:middle line:84%
we did some scans of
the land right there.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And you had normal readings
to a certain depth,

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and then below that, it
was completely blacked out,

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.650 align:middle line:84%
as if there could be something
under the ground there

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:28.650 align:middle line:90%
at the landing site.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.670 align:middle line:10%
And these creatures were
found there around the pond.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:33.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They're
bizarre-looking creatures.

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.880 align:middle line:10%
>>PAIGE: They're very bizarre.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.330 align:middle line:10%
And what's fascinating to me
about these were reported way

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.090 align:middle line:10%
back in the '70s
in the APRO report.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:42.420 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks
like baby crocodiles.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I don't
know what they are.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel
safe going there?

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: In the daytime, I'm
OK if I'm with other people.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
won't go at night.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:52.882 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:37:52.882 --> 00:37:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I won't go at night.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.020 align:middle line:90%
And

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, not unless
I'm with a group of people.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.080 align:middle line:84%
I would go at night
with a group of people,

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.790 align:middle line:90%
but I just feel uneasy.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.080 align:middle line:90%
I still feel watched.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I just, put it this way,
there is a house for sale

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:08.450 align:middle line:84%
really close to the property,
and I for about two seconds

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:10.410 align:middle line:84%
thought maybe I would
to live out there.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And then really quickly I
thought, no, I don't think so.

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.582 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they conducted
any experiments out there?

00:38:15.582 --> 00:38:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, they
have, and we're

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.360 align:middle line:90%
continuing to do that as well.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind?

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I'm just
like flying drones.

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:24.000 align:middle line:84%
We're doing readings out
there, EMF readings, radiation

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.480 align:middle line:90%
readings, those kind of things.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'm in the process right
now with Rocky Mountain Ranch

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.120 align:middle line:84%
research, getting a
good team together.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a scientist,
I'm not really great

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:84%
with these different
kinds of equipments.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.160 align:middle line:84%
We did some radio experiments
with the crystal radio

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.240 align:middle line:84%
where I tried to
communicate with the house.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Got interesting results
back with that I

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.920 align:middle line:84%
want to recreate that,
those kind of things,

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.720 align:middle line:84%
to see if we can meditate and
communicate with what's there

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and really bring some positive
energy to the location.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Katie, do you ever have
reports of people disappearing

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.490 align:middle line:90%
out there?

00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, there was one
case, I was able to debunk it,

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.180 align:middle line:84%
back in the '70s of a
reporter that went missing,

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:84%
but later found out
that he was found.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So I hope that that's
not going out there.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:11.310 align:middle line:84%
But I often wonder where
David Pilate is, yeah.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did he go?

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, I think the
story is he just moved away.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.993 align:middle line:84%
It was of a false story, but so
hopefully nobody's disappearing.

00:39:18.993 --> 00:39:20.660 align:middle line:84%
That being said,
there's a lot of people

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.743 align:middle line:84%
that live there for short
periods of time and move

00:39:22.743 --> 00:39:24.830 align:middle line:90%
away quickly.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you buy the ranch
if you had the money to do it?

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I don't think so.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.460 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are not?

00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: No.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.815 align:middle line:84%
The only reason I
would want to do that

00:39:33.815 --> 00:39:35.932 align:middle line:84%
would be for study
and research, but I

00:39:35.932 --> 00:39:37.890 align:middle line:84%
don't know if I'd want
to live there full time.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
I'd be comfortable.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David Morehouse
is a great remote viewer.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's taken
a look at this, too?

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: He has.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:48.800 align:middle line:84%
David Morehouse, they actually
did the biggest remote view

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.423 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
the United States,

00:39:50.423 --> 00:39:51.840 align:middle line:84%
right there at the
ranch property.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they see?

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: They had
over 70 remote viewers

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:56.010 align:middle line:84%
from several
different countries.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.260 align:middle line:90%
They had over 3,000 data points.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And when he briefed me on
what they saw out there,

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:06.180 align:middle line:84%
the remote viewers, I
was just, from the boxes,

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.490 align:middle line:84%
they remote-viewed the boxes
with these electrical sounds

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:10.290 align:middle line:90%
coming off.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:14.030 align:middle line:84%
They remote-viewed the Sasquatch
creatures, military presence

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.380 align:middle line:90%
or police presence.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.230 align:middle line:84%
They remote-viewed
several different types

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.510 align:middle line:84%
of entities and creatures
out there, different crafts.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And David Morehouse said,
it's kind of like a hub,

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.010 align:middle line:84%
a hub of intergalactic
freeway kind of thing

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.370 align:middle line:90%
there at that ranch property.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So, so many of the things
I experienced out there,

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.280 align:middle line:90%
the remote viewers picked up on.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were the results
of some of the scientific tests?

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, we
had unusual behavior

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.900 align:middle line:84%
from the rockets, unusual
behaviors from the drones.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.228 align:middle line:84%
Unusual radar or ground
penetrating radar results

00:40:45.228 --> 00:40:47.270 align:middle line:84%
with the blacked out
underneath the landing site.

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:48.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they show?

00:40:48.395 --> 00:40:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: They're showing
this big void underground.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.980 align:middle line:84%
We also did a crystal
radio experiment

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.825 align:middle line:84%
where the Ham operator tried to
communicate with the location.

00:40:57.825 --> 00:40:58.700 align:middle line:90%
Nothing would happen.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.790 align:middle line:84%
It only would respond
when I would communicate

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.400 align:middle line:84%
through the radio and just
the equipment just went crazy.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, hello, remember me?

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:07.123 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were blocking you?

00:41:07.123 --> 00:41:09.820 align:middle line:10%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, it was
like something intelligent

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.760 align:middle line:10%
was aware of my presence being
back on the ranch property

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.640 align:middle line:10%
and would communicate
with me every time.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.813 align:middle line:84%
So it was quite unusual and
everybody was just like,

00:41:18.813 --> 00:41:20.980 align:middle line:84%
oh, my goodness, I can't
believe that even happened.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had to
bet the ranch, what would

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.680 align:middle line:90%
you say is happening out there?

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.320 align:middle line:10%
>>PAIGE: I would
say now more, like I

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.540 align:middle line:10%
think the military presence
out there is mostly gone now.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.630 align:middle line:10%
I think what's
happening out there now

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:36.070 align:middle line:10%
is paranormal and
unexplained activity,

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:10%
with the recent mutilations
happening out there now.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I just recently
had an elk hunter

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.330 align:middle line:84%
that had an unusual
encounter out there.

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So things are
still happening out

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.450 align:middle line:90%
there that can't be explained.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I continue
to do research out there.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Katie, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:41:51.055 --> 00:41:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Thank you, George.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we're now
aware of the Skinwalker Ranch

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and now the Rocky Mountain
Ranch in Colorado.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Both places have shown
some incredible phenomena.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Is it ET?

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Is it earthbound?

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.580 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we'll find out.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
