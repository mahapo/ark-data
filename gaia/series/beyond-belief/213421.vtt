Ronny, welcome to the program.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RONNY LE BLANC: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.100 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are a busy guy.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah,
it's been a wild ride.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:10%
>>LE BLANC: I've always had an
interest in the subject of UFOs

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.717 align:middle line:10%
and Bigfoot.

00:00:45.717 --> 00:00:47.800 align:middle line:10%
I spent a lot of time in
the library reading books

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:10%
around this.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
But I had a really
interesting experience

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that I could not really
understand when I was about 11

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:90%
in Leominster State Forest Area.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Know that well.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.165 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah.

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Your family is from Fitchburg.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it was something--

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.660 align:middle line:10%
I was by myself.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:10%
I was on my bike.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:10%
I was meeting some
friends, going

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.690 align:middle line:10%
to Monsterland, which I had no
idea why it was called that.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.320 align:middle line:84%
It was just a place where
we would go ride bikes

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:90%
and four-wheelers.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And on my way, I was
going through a trail,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:90%
and I had stopped.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:84%
I noticed right away
that this area was--

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:90%
there were no animal sounds.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.950 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I was being watched.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
It just had a
different energy to it.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could sense it.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:90%
You could--

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.098 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Absolutely.

00:01:32.098 --> 00:01:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I had both feet on the
ground, my bike in between me.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, to the left,
the forest started to erupt.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:90%
I saw shrubs and trees moving.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.742 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel
footsteps reverberate

00:01:43.742 --> 00:01:44.950 align:middle line:90%
through the soles of my feet.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So I expected a moose to
emerge from that greenery

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:90%
onto the trail.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was that heavy.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: It was that heavy.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:90%
And what I saw--

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
what it was moving with
the trees and shrubs,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
it had to be
something very large.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And when it came onto the
trail, there was nothing there.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And it continued on
to the other side.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Same situation, trees
and shrubs moving.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And my mind was trying to grasp
this idea that I just witnessed

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:90%
something that was invisible.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I never thought of Bigfoot
or anything like that,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.848 align:middle line:90%
but I went right home.

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:90%
I didn't meet my friends.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And it just puzzled me,
went into my subconscious

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't
come up with an answer.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
until decades later

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.637 align:middle line:84%
that I started really
looking into Bigfoot and some

00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:84%
of the different theories
about these things

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
being interdimensional, having
the capability of cloaking.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I feel
like I had that experience.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
at 11 years old,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
you're not expected to
come up with an answer.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: That's right.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was just--

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I knew all the
animals in that area.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I spent so much
time in the woods,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:84%
spending my days going through
Brooks and everything else.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So that idea just never
popped into my head

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:84%
about Bigfoot, especially
being in Massachusetts.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that that
was definitely not the case.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:84%
There were a multitude
of sightings just

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:84%
in and around this area
called Monsterland.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is Monsterland?

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: It's about
a 5,000-acre forest.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Initially, this was a location
that was near a small community.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.050 align:middle line:84%
They started to develop that,
houses and different businesses.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the activity seemed
to really start picking up

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:90%
around Leominster State Forest.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
People were seeing UFOs,
finding tracks of what

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.650 align:middle line:90%
looked like Bigfoot creatures.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
These orange orbs
were being seen.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is a multitude of
things that were happening in,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:90%
around this area.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was also very
interesting that Fort Devens

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:90%
was about five miles away.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And we had all this
different activity.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Betty Andreasson was
an alien abductee

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and she had her first
experience in Leominster.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of history with
strangeness in Leominster.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got the
phrase "Monsterland"?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: What I
found out is people

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:84%
were seeing Bigfoot
creatures as early as 1880,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and so they named this
location Monsterland.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.689 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
to make sense

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:90%
why it was given that name.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Farmers were witnessing these
tall, hairy creatures taking

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
pigs from their
farm, or they were

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:90%
finding cattle torn to shreds.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea that
there's something else living

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:84%
alongside us, and the different
Native American stories

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:84%
about these things, was
pretty fascinating to find out

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.790 align:middle line:84%
that other people
were experiencing

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:90%
similar type of creatures.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has there been any
definitive evidence, footprints,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.568 align:middle line:84%
casts, anything
like that out there?

00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: We did capture
something pretty incredible.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend of mine,
his brother and his wife

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
were out hiking in Leominster
State Forest back in 2010.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
They were the only
ones in the forest

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that they could
see at that time.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.178 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Popular forest, huh?

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Very popular.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:84%
But that particular day
was like 90 in June.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.468 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's pretty
much at the beach.

00:05:10.468 --> 00:05:11.510 align:middle line:90%
They're out in the woods.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And they went through this
particular trail on the way

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
to find the reservoir,
Newtown Reservoir,

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:90%
to go do some fishing.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And they went the
wrong direction.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So when they came back to
this fork in the trail,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Bill had noticed
footsteps in the mud.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And as he got closer,
he could see toes.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:90%
And what freaked him out--

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Toes?

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Toes.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:90%
Visible toes.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a
human footprint.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
What freaked him
out, that there were

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
six of these in a straight
line with a six-foot stride.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:84%
They were 3.5 deep
into the ground.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
an 11-foot animal.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Huge.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever it is.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah, he instantly
was like, OK, this is either

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
a crazy person running
around the woods,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:84%
or all those stories of
Bigfoot in Monsterland

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.890 align:middle line:90%
were starting to come together.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And instantly, they
got freaked out.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:84%
It took them 45 minutes
to get to this location,

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.330 align:middle line:84%
but it took them another 2.5
hours to get out of the forest.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why so long?

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.485 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: What ends up
happening when people have

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
these Bigfoot experiences,
they may not see one,

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.320 align:middle line:84%
they may find
something interesting.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.350 align:middle line:84%
They felt like they
got all twisted around,

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
like something zapped
them in their head

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't figure
out how to get out.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people talk
about this similar situation

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.770 align:middle line:84%
after or before a
Bigfoot experience.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they lose time?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Some cases,
there is that indication

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that there might be
some missing time.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:84%
In this particular case, they
were just extremely frightened.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Had no idea what
they had discovered.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
His brother called me
to tell me about it.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Bill
days after the event.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:90%
He was still visibly shaken.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't sleep.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.830 align:middle line:84%
He was calling his mom
with tears in his eyes.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.495 align:middle line:84%
And this is someone that's
45 years old and a hunter.

00:07:05.495 --> 00:07:08.550 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't go back
unless someone had a gun.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And both me and his
brother joined him,

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and I brought a
small plaster kit.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:84%
We ended up finding
the trackway again,

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.262 align:middle line:84%
casted the best-looking
print we could.

00:07:18.262 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still have it?

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: He
still has it, yes.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%
As we're waiting for that to
dry, a series of four-wheelers

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:90%
were coming up the trail.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And we had to jump
in front of them

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
to stop them from
going over the tracks.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they would
have smashed the tracks.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.643 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: And it
dawned on me, if we

00:07:33.643 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:84%
had gotten there
10 minutes later,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:90%
those tracks would be gone.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: There would
be no Monsterland book.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.135 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
"Expedition Bigfoot."

00:07:41.135 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:90%
There would be none of that.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So that was really, I think,
the genesis to really put me

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
on this particular path.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ronny, could you
demonstrate just how big

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.840 align:middle line:84%
the cast of that
foot might have been?

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah, it was
about 10.5 inches long,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
so a normal
human-sized footprint.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about the width?

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: The width
was about five inches,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:84%
so that's about half
of that length, which

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:90%
we call the Sasquatch ratio.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And it just was much bigger in
proportion, especially the toes.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it look more like
an ape foot or a human foot?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: It looked
like a little bit of both.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It looked more human, but what
we noticed, that it had what's

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.340 align:middle line:84%
called the midtarsal
break and almost

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:84%
like a hinge in the
middle of that foot.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:84%
The other piece was the fact
that it was five inches across

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
as half the length,
and that's something

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.892 align:middle line:90%
we call the Sasquatch ratio.

00:08:29.892 --> 00:08:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good width.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah, so if you
see a 20-inch print, typically,

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:84%
that width could be
about 10 inches across.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So it seemed to follow
that same ratio.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.480 align:middle line:84%
We had it analyzed by the
BFRO, Dr. David Break.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:90%
And he--

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good guy.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: --said, hey, this
is a legitimate Sasquatch print.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:84%
There's been sightings in and
around your area over the past--

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds of years,
but specifically, there's

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
been sightings in and around
this area known as Monsterland.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you can rule out
a guy with a foot patch--

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Correct.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --popping it
in the ground, right?

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.323 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Correct.

00:09:03.323 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and these were 3.5
inches deep into the ground.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So when Bill tried to put
his foot down, 245 pounds,

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.830 align:middle line:84%
tried to push down with us,
he could barely break an inch.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So whatever this thing
was, was extremely heavy.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And the stride itself
is almost impossible

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.270 align:middle line:90%
to really duplicate as a human.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ronny, in
some Bigfoot sightings,

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:84%
there are reports of orbs
floating all over the place.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.877 align:middle line:84%
Do you pick that
up in Monsterland?

00:09:29.877 --> 00:09:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: We have.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And what was really strange,
this capture of this cast led

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Bill and I to be on the
show "Finding Bigfoot."

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great show.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.258 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Great show.

00:09:42.258 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was about a week before
they were about to air the show,

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'm driving home,
and suddenly, there's

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:84%
two orange balls of light about
the size of a basketball, maybe

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:90%
a little bit bigger.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
One over the other,
flying towards my car

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:90%
as I'm heading into Leominster.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.730 align:middle line:90%
I rolled down my window.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.760 align:middle line:84%
This is late
December, still cold.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:90%
They were completely silent.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.700 align:middle line:90%
They flew right over my car.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And they continued
towards Lunenburg,

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.840 align:middle line:90%
towards the swamp area.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just was blown
away by this experience.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So when I got home, I told
my wife what I had seen.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And seeing these orbs, there was
definitely an energy about it.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I felt like there
was some intelligence

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:90%
behind these things.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:90%
They weren't just--

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you feel any
emotion with them around?

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: I definitely
felt something special is

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:90%
the best way I could label it.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
That what I was
witnessing, not everybody

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.270 align:middle line:84%
has this chance to
have these experiences.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:84%
But what freaked me out
is when I had gotten home

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and told my wife, I had
jumped onto my computer,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:90%
and Facebook was up.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.898 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed my friend
Ryan was on messenger,

00:10:54.898 --> 00:10:56.190 align:middle line:90%
has a little green light next--

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.282 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The little green
light shows he's there.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: And
something told me,

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:90%
"Tell Ryan what you experienced.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Send him a note."

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't a voice.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:90%
It was just a feeling.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to send
him a message and say,

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.460 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to believe
what I just saw 10 minutes ago.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I saw two orange balls
of light fly over my car.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And he responded
immediately, in all caps,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.080 align:middle line:84%
you're freaking
me out right now.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.250 align:middle line:84%
He goes, were you at
the Leominster Connector

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:90%
when this happened?

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is an area,
this intersection.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.280 align:middle line:90%
And I said yes.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I was there.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
He was waiting at the
light at one intersection

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:90%
as I was driving by.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And that blew me away.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:84%
But what he said after
this took it another level.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you know what I've
been doing for the past two

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:90%
years?

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:84%
We hadn't talked
in quite some time,

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.130 align:middle line:84%
but I knew he was
interested in this subject.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.520 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I'm a UFO investigator.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, uh,
we need to meet.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And so we ended up getting
together and talking about this.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But that was one of
about nine sightings

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I've had of these orange orbs
at the beginning of this Bigfoot

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:90%
run.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So there seemed to be some
interesting connection

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:90%
with these orbs and Bigfoot.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it seems like
UFOs are prevalent in some

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.670 align:middle line:90%
of these cases.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:90%
Do you pick that up?

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Absolutely.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Some of these are--

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:84%
people are seeing
flying saucers,

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:90%
cylindrical-shaped craft.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:84%
They're also seeing
these type of orbs,

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:90%
orange to white colored.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Oftentimes, these are--

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big are these orbs?

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Like this?

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.313 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Some of them about
the size of a basketball.

00:12:36.313 --> 00:12:38.673 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some that are about
the size of a beach ball.

00:12:38.673 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good size.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: We
actually had one that

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:84%
was about the size of
a tennis ball, a golf

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:90%
ball, that was in our house.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they dissipate?

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: We've seen
these things just vanish.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:90%
We had one just--

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.705 align:middle line:84%
almost like they go behind some
kind of door and they're gone.

00:12:55.705 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or into a
portal or something.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.747 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: That's
what I believe.

00:12:58.747 --> 00:13:02.190 align:middle line:84%
They are popping out of a
dimension, popping back in.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.057 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend that
was witnessing--

00:13:04.057 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
we're standing next to
each other, had binoculars,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're watching one
going across the sky.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Blue, blue sky, bright daylight.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.370 align:middle line:84%
He was watching in the
binoculars, was zooming in,

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:84%
saying, what am
I-- what is this?

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:18.870 align:middle line:90%
What am I looking at?

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it
just disappeared

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:84%
right before his eyes
as he's watching it.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many people believe
Bigfoot could be dimensional.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Could be from a UFO.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I love the theory
that it's Earth-based

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:84%
because it sounds more exciting
to me, but what do you think?

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: I do think that
they are interdimensional.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I do think that they
are connected to UFOs

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:90%
and different portal areas.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be around
areas that are high-energy.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They come
and go through these--

00:13:50.695 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: It seems to be
that they pop in and out

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:90%
through these dimensions.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
People have shown me
photographs of a Bigfoot

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:84%
with half of its body
missing, but the upper torso

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.710 align:middle line:90%
is visible and materialized.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So they have this ability to
go between the spirit world,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:90%
these different dimensions.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's a Yakama tribe that
has a story about a Bigfoot

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:90%
that lived with the tribe.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And they said that this isn't a
legend, but a real story that's

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:90%
been passed down.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
This hairy, colored--
hairy-covered creature

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:84%
with glowing eyes came
to live with the tribe.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It communicated to
them via telepathy.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lived with the tribe.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.895 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Lived
with the tribe,

00:14:33.895 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:90%
communicated via telepathy.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.018 align:middle line:84%
When any of the tribal members
got sick, it would heal them.

00:14:39.018 --> 00:14:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And it lived with them
for many, many years

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
until it communicated that
it was going to pass away

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and it needed to be brought
to a specific location.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So they do seem to have
an expiration date.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
The tribe brought this Bigfoot
creature to this location.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.615 align:middle line:90%
They stood back.

00:14:55.615 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:90%
It took its last breath.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:57.980 align:middle line:90%
It passed away.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, they watched
as a UFO descended from the sky,

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.613 align:middle line:84%
picked up the UFO
body, and took off.

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Beamed it Up?

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Beamed it up.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.733 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: So maybe they are
connected with these UFOs.

00:15:11.733 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
amazing story, Ronny.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.358 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Incredible.

00:15:14.358 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And something that ties in what
other people have experienced

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and seen, that these
things are seemingly

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:84%
having the ability to
even come into your home,

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:84%
to change shape and form,
and to cloak or go invisible.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got to
still picture of something

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.520 align:middle line:84%
you captured, an orb shooting
across the sky one night.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the story and
let's look at this picture.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah, this
was pretty incredible,

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.055 align:middle line:84%
where I had done a
show in New Hampshire,

00:15:44.055 --> 00:15:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and they were talking to
Bill and I about Monsterland.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
camerawomen came up to me

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.480 align:middle line:84%
after we had finished filming,
and she had tears in her eyes.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And she was trying
to explain to me

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that she was communicating and
working with the angelic realm.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And that they
communicated to her

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:84%
that I could learn
how to go invisible.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I can learn these
different things.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And she commented that you could
capture a picture of these orbs

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.360 align:middle line:90%
anytime.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
She was showing me photos
from inside her house,

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:90%
outside her house.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, what
do I need to do?

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.080 align:middle line:90%
She said, take your camera.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Shut off the flash
on your phone.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Go into the backyard.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.682 align:middle line:84%
And communicate that you want
to capture a photo or picture

00:16:27.682 --> 00:16:28.640 align:middle line:90%
of one of these things.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.673 align:middle line:84%
So I spoke out loud and
said, OK, I'm ready.

00:16:32.673 --> 00:16:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
taking pictures

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.135 align:middle line:84%
and I'll see if I can
capture one of these.

00:16:36.135 --> 00:16:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
what you did.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: So I
took five photos.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
The first four,
there was nothing.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:84%
On my last photo, I turned away
from the viewfinder of the phone

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and I took the picture,
and there was a flash.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.738 align:middle line:84%
And I put it in my
pocket because I didn't

00:16:52.738 --> 00:16:53.780 align:middle line:90%
want to get disappointed.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
maybe I hit the flash

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.430 align:middle line:90%
and the flash went off.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:90%
So I stuck it in my pocket.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I bring my kids home
from my parents' house

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.650 align:middle line:90%
five minutes later.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I take out the phone and I
look and I see this photo.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.349 align:middle line:90%
And I'm freaking out.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:84%
The lady, Sherry, I had
sent her the message.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I just captured
this image of an orb--

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I got an orb.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.455 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: --just
like you said.

00:17:15.455 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And she said, your
name, I was just

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:84%
given your name about
five minutes ago,

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:90%
said, Ronny Le Blanc.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.859 align:middle line:84%
And when they sent me that
message, when I hear it

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:84%
from the angelic realm a
particular person's name,

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.882 align:middle line:84%
they will normally get in
touch with me within 24 hours.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's tuned in, huh?

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:31.965 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Tuned in.

00:17:31.965 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you just called
me back in five minutes

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:90%
after I got your name.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was blown away by this.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to one of my
daughters in the kitchen.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Hung up the phone with her.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And as we're talking, a light
being appeared in the doorway.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.615 align:middle line:84%
And both my daughter
and I saw it.

00:17:51.615 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:84%
It appeared, pure white
light, head, torso--

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.202 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like angelic?

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: It
looked like angelic.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And it appeared
right in the doorway.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:84%
We both saw it for about
three or four seconds.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.600 align:middle line:84%
It appeared and
then disappeared.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And she described
exactly what I had seen.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And that came right after
witnessing this orb,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.700 align:middle line:90%
talking about it.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So that whole connection,
it really started to tell me

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot more
going on than we think.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a
company called Weedscape.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:23.335 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Yes.

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:24.418 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about it.

00:18:24.418 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like a dispensary.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah,
what we're doing--

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
in Massachusetts, in
Colorado, cannabis is legal.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:32.980 align:middle line:90%
And just recently--

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm right.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Yes, you're right.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is we actually
create outdoor cannabis gardens,

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:90%
gated, fenced-in.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
But what we are
doing is actually

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.785 align:middle line:84%
taking Native American plant
species, pollinator plants,

00:18:48.785 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:84%
30 different species that
will bring in the monarch

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:84%
butterflies, the bees,
the hummingbirds.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And we plant these
around the garden.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:02.745 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically to try
to build up this ecosystem.

00:19:02.745 --> 00:19:06.880 align:middle line:84%
What we started noticing is it
seemed to create something else.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And during one of
our photo shoots,

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.243 align:middle line:84%
we captured a similar
picture of that one.

00:19:11.243 --> 00:19:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
take a look at that

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and have you explain
what we're looking at.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Sure.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the plants
that I was tending to.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.575 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking.

00:19:21.575 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're on
a huge ladder there?

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Huge ladder.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.230 align:middle line:90%
This is about a 12-foot plant.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is in my backyard.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And to the right
there, my daughter

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:90%
had taken a series of photos.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:90%
That is not a rope.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:90%
That is an orb.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're catching it streaking,
either coming from the tree

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:90%
or going to the tree.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Small one.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.035 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Small one.

00:19:44.035 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Looks to be about size of maybe
a golf ball, what have you.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But that was something
that I didn't

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.060 align:middle line:90%
feel it or witness it once we--

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You didn't even know.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
You didn't even know
it was behind you.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Didn't even
know it went by, no.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And there were no
birds or anything

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:90%
that were moving around.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.645 align:middle line:84%
But I was like, wow, we just
captured an orb in daylight.

00:20:04.645 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's look
at the other picture here.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.020 align:middle line:10%
>>LE BLANC: So this was
another interesting thing

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:10%
that was showing up.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:10%
These rainbow lights--
is kind of showing up all

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.580 align:middle line:10%
throughout around the garden.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:10%
And this is right
to the left of it.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:10%
And it's a little tough
to see, but you can almost

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:10%
see the spiral up
in the corner there.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.820 align:middle line:10%
And I think we
captured a portal.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:10%
Because inside this photo
of this spiral is a face.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you zoom into it, you
can see what looks like eyes.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.978 align:middle line:84%
And our backyard-- yes, you can
see almost like a face in there.

00:20:41.978 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks
like an alien face.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah, and it
was just astonishing to me.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.638 align:middle line:90%
I've never--

00:20:48.638 --> 00:20:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Actually, it
looks like a little old man

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:90%
with a mustache.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah,
you can clearly

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:90%
see what looks like eyes.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.603 align:middle line:90%
We did have-- this is--

00:20:57.603 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bulging eyes.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.562 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Bulging eyes.

00:20:59.562 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We live right next to
Barrett Park, which

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.810 align:middle line:84%
is-- we have a trail that comes
right out of our driveway,

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And I had a psychic medium
come up to this area years

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.260 align:middle line:84%
ago, three or four
years ago, and told me

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.210 align:middle line:84%
that there are
Bigfoot creatures that

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.030 align:middle line:84%
are coming down to the lake,
walking through this area

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:90%
to come feed.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that they
are interdimensional.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.790 align:middle line:84%
We did have a rock
thrown at our shed

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:84%
from the backyard from this
particular location two

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:90%
summers ago.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So we've had a lot of activity
in and around our house,

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:84%
but to capture
some of this stuff

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.860 align:middle line:90%
has been pretty astounding.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the significance is, Ronny,

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:84%
of the tie-in between the orbs
and the Bigfoot sightings?

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: It's
a great question

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.050 align:middle line:84%
because there's
a lot of theories

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:90%
out there that is it them?

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Is it Sasquatch, these beings?

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Are they the orbs, that
they're actually traveling in--

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.892 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And just
materialize into the other--

00:21:58.892 --> 00:21:59.725 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Correct.

00:21:59.725 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And you have orbs
in UFO encounters.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.700 align:middle line:84%
You have them in paranormal
encounters and Bigfoot.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:84%
They seem to go across
all three of these things.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So there seems to be legends
and talks about the shamans,

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Native American
shamans, that would

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
be able to transform
themselves into a ball of light

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.570 align:middle line:84%
so that they could
traverse long distances

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.767 align:middle line:84%
and then rematerialize
at those locations.

00:22:22.767 --> 00:22:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always,
when I was younger,

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:29.630 align:middle line:84%
thought orbs might have been
the spirit of the dead, souls

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.250 align:middle line:90%
traveling.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.228 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:22:32.228 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: I believe so.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.343 align:middle line:84%
I believe so because we captured
these things in different

00:22:37.343 --> 00:22:39.260 align:middle line:84%
videos, say, on "Paranormal
Caught on Camera,"

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
where you see a chair
about to fall over.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And moments before that, there's
an orb that flies over to it

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and then the action happens.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.240 align:middle line:90%
So is it some sort of--

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.380 align:middle line:84%
almost like, well, we create
a 2D shadow with our 3D forms?

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Are these lights
indicators of something

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:90%
coming from another dimension?

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.517 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
another picture

00:23:01.517 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:84%
to look at about a significant
UFO sighting in Monsterland.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what we have here.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.277 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah, so this
was the site of a famous--

00:23:10.277 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's right
behind you, Ronny.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: It is.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:84%
The story with this
is pretty incredible

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:84%
because, in 1967,
a couple witnessed

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
a flying saucer over this
cemetery a street over--

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Betty Andreasson was living.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.862 align:middle line:84%
She had all these
different UFO experiences.

00:23:30.862 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was referring to
Stanton Friedman, wasn't she?

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Yes.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Christine Peterson,
who was coming down

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to do a story for the
Telegram & Gazette,

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.130 align:middle line:84%
had brought an infrared
lens for her camera

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:84%
in hopes that we could
capture, potentially, a UFO.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.542 align:middle line:84%
And so she said, where do
you think would be the best

00:23:52.542 --> 00:23:53.500 align:middle line:90%
place for us to set up?

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think the
sighting took place?

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I had no real idea, but from
the street, the vantage point,

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
this area seemed to be
visible that if someone

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:84%
did see a UFO from the road,
this could be the location.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.417 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you aware
of the UFO behind you?

00:24:06.417 --> 00:24:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: I was not, no.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.860 align:middle line:90%
And she took a series of photos.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, Ronny,
we got something.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's I think a
close-up photo of this.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:84%
But we captured that
classic flying saucer.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.430 align:middle line:84%
There are several photos
before and after this,

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:24.730 align:middle line:90%
fractions of a second.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the frame.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:90%
It shows up right there.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now your
wife saw green UFOs?

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:10%
>>LE BLANC: Yes,
Wachusett Reservoir,

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.270 align:middle line:10%
which is one of the main
reservoirs that supplies water

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:10%
to Boston, there's been a lot of
talks about people seeing UFOs

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.160 align:middle line:10%
over there, but
more specifically,

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:10%
people seeing Grey aliens
peeking behind trees.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And my wife was working
at this Wachusett Country

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Club, which is--

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:84%
visible Wachusett
Reservoir's there.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:84%
4th of July, they are
cleaning up outside the tables

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and they're seeing the
fireworks going up to the left

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.450 align:middle line:90%
of the reservoir.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the girls says,
hey, that firework is

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:90%
going in the wrong direction.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And they see this green ball
light come out of the sky

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.710 align:middle line:90%
and shooting down.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.952 align:middle line:84%
And it goes into
Wachusett Reservoir.

00:25:13.952 --> 00:25:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
wasn't a meteorite.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: It
wasn't a meteorite.

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Completely silent.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.130 align:middle line:84%
They saw it go into the water,
but they were a little freaked

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:22.730 align:middle line:90%
out because there was no sound.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.360 align:middle line:84%
They didn't see a
wake or a splash.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And she told me
about this sighting.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later,
they're out there again,

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.940 align:middle line:84%
now with five other
witnesses, and they see

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:90%
this same green ball of light.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.820 align:middle line:90%
There's no fireworks this time.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It comes out of the
same point in the sky,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:84%
goes right into the same point
in the Wachusett Reservoir.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, no sound,
no wake, no splash.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:84%
They're all blown
away because she

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:90%
had talked about seeing this.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.550 align:middle line:90%
They all clean up.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.350 align:middle line:90%
They go inside.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
She's still outside
finishing up and she

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.110 align:middle line:84%
sees the silhouettes
of the trees,

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and something peeks
behind the tree.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.168 align:middle line:84%
And she calls me up
on the phone and she's

00:26:03.168 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:84%
like, I'm not sure if I'm
seeing a raccoon or some kind

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.550 align:middle line:84%
of animal, but we just saw
this-- had another sighting.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And she's seeing this
thing popping out

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.110 align:middle line:90%
as she's talking on the phone.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't tell
her at the time.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.530 align:middle line:90%
I told her when she got home.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But IBM had purchased
the company Digital back

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.000 align:middle line:90%
in the '80s.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.922 align:middle line:84%
And there was one of the
first internet chat groups

00:26:24.922 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:90%
that they were communicating.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.463 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking about--
the employees were talking

00:26:28.463 --> 00:26:32.040 align:middle line:84%
about people seeing UFOs
and Grey aliens specifically

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:84%
peeking behind these trees
at Wachusett Reservoir.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what she saw.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.018 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: And that's
what she saw right

00:26:37.018 --> 00:26:39.967 align:middle line:84%
after one of these green UFOs
had entered into the reservoir.

00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there have been a
lot of sightings in Monsterland.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah, a ton.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody
ever been hurt?

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: As far as
we know, there has not

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.670 align:middle line:90%
been anyone that's been hurt.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.570 align:middle line:84%
We have had different
people, witnesses

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that have told me they've
seen a green orb approach them

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:04.370 align:middle line:84%
in the woods, change
into the color orange.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And then approach them,
come right to them.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And he woke up in
darkness, had missing time.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And he was out there
looking for Bigfoot.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.970 align:middle line:90%
So he had this experience--

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: --with missing time
that we talked about earlier.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you captured
some UFO activity in the sky.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.210 align:middle line:84%

this little clip here.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.950 align:middle line:90%
What's that one?

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:90%
- This one.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:45.450 align:middle line:90%
- Where?

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:45.900 align:middle line:90%
- Right here.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: So what was
incredible is prior to this--

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and I still kick myself that
I wasn't filming before--

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:84%
my wife and I were
in the garage.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Summertime, garage
door is open, and we're

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:84%
talking about moving to
our new house in two weeks,

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.720 align:middle line:90%
next to Leominster State Forest.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, that
forest comes up again.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yes, and I said, "I
can't wait for us to move there.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.510 align:middle line:90%
There's so much activity.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see a
lot of crazy stuff."

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, something
touches her leg.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And she mentions it like
something touched her.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:84%
It happens a second time
about a minute or two later.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
time, she said

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.645 align:middle line:84%
it felt like feathers were
grazing against her leg,

00:28:44.645 --> 00:28:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a bird?

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Yes.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "It
seems like someone's

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.510 align:middle line:90%
trying to get your attention.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's go outside."

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.140 align:middle line:84%
We get up, walk
out of the garage.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:84%
We were walking to the
house and we both stop.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Our jaws drop, and we witness--

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm calling them thunderbirds.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those are huge birds.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Huge, but it
was a much different form.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Reddish orange, almost
this plasma-like material,

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:84%
almost like a fiery
dragon or a phoenix.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.400 align:middle line:90%
The size of a bus.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Completely silent and
it's chasing after one

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.260 align:middle line:90%
of similar size that is green.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're moving like dolphins
swimming under the ocean.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:84%
We both look at each other
like we're witnessing a scene

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.425 align:middle line:90%
from a science fiction film.

00:29:30.425 --> 00:29:32.780 align:middle line:90%
They fly out of view.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.340 align:middle line:90%
And I said, let's stick around.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Typically, you have
a UFO sighting,

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:90%
there's another one coming.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, here comes
this green ball of light,

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.770 align:middle line:84%
very similar to
what she had seen

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:90%
going to Wachusett Reservoir.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right behind it.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Right behind these
thunderbirds, following them.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Like in the Book
of Ezekiel, talking

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.920 align:middle line:84%
about a wheel within
a wheel, we're

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:84%
seeing something
spinning inside.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:84%
The light was intensifying
and glowing, again,

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.290 align:middle line:90%
completely silent.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And it follows those
two thunderbirds.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we had
this last sighting

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.752 align:middle line:84%
where she had pulled out her
phone because she could see this

00:30:04.752 --> 00:30:07.400 align:middle line:84%
coming from the distance,
flying almost like a sparrow,

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.840 align:middle line:84%
where they're
flapping their wings

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and they start dropping
down and coming up.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And it had this very similar
motion like those two

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.770 align:middle line:90%
first thunderbirds.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:17.770 align:middle line:90%
So it was incredible.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Native Americans have
talked about the thunderbirds

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.380 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of time.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.540 align:middle line:84%
In Alton, Illinois,
Ronny, there's

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:29.370 align:middle line:84%
a story of what is
called the Piasa Bird.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is a huge bird that the
Indians would try to capture.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.200 align:middle line:90%
They weren't able to.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.833 align:middle line:90%
But this sounds the same thing.

00:30:39.833 --> 00:30:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: It sounds the
same thing and it sounds--

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I was really expecting
to see something

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:48.770 align:middle line:84%
more tangible, something
like a large bird,

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.520 align:middle line:84%
but these things
definitely seem to be

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.170 align:middle line:84%
more plasma-based
than anything else.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And probably, the most amazing
thing I've ever seen in my life.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And I just really
kick myself that I

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.810 align:middle line:84%
didn't pull out my phone
immediately and start

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:90%
filming those.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:84%
It was such this
awe moment that you

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to take your
eyes off of this experience.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.680 align:middle line:84%
So many times you hear
about those, you turn away

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and these things
disappear, so my eyes were

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:90%
glued on what we were seeing.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have heard rumors
that the CIA and the National

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Security Agency, the
NSA, have been involved

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.360 align:middle line:90%
in studying Monsterland.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard about that?

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: I've
had my suspicions

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:33.025 align:middle line:84%
because Betty
Andreasson, who had

00:31:33.025 --> 00:31:34.900 align:middle line:84%
her experiences in
Leominster, was witnessing

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:39.790 align:middle line:84%
these black unmarked helicopters
flying over the property

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:90%
whenever they had UFO sightings.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was speaking
at a conference,

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and I had a member
that approached me

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.740 align:middle line:84%
that was stationed
at Fort Devens,

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and told me that the CIA and
the NSA was indeed there.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I asked him what they were doing
there, what they were studying.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.300 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't quite
sure, but he said

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.050 align:middle line:84%
that 80% of the base,
the military, the army

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:06.470 align:middle line:90%
can't even access.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing
something there.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
area at Devens,

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:17.620 align:middle line:84%
there's a 47-acre fusion
generator being built by MIT

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:90%
and another company.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like The
Large Hadron Collider

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.587 align:middle line:90%
between France and Switzerland.

00:32:22.587 --> 00:32:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Exactly.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
doing, this is supposed

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.350 align:middle line:84%
to be the largest
one in the world,

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.780 align:middle line:84%
is being placed
right there, which

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:84%
this could be a
potential portal site,

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.828 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they're
interested in having something

00:32:33.828 --> 00:32:35.080 align:middle line:90%
like that there.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intriguing.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything
else about this?

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: I have
been doing some digging

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and talking to a few
different people.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I did meet an individual that
was part of the intelligence

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:50.020 align:middle line:84%
apparatus at Fort
Devens and told me

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.350 align:middle line:84%
they're definitely working
on some interesting things.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm hoping to get
some more insight into this.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They think the Hadron
colliders, if not done properly,

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.660 align:middle line:90%
could create black holes.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Correct.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's the idea
that we're starting

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:11.200 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand what is
reality, these different quarks

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.020 align:middle line:90%
and things that are subatomic.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.460 align:middle line:84%
There is the fear
that they could

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.917 align:middle line:84%
be opening up spacetime,
creating a portal,

00:33:19.917 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:84%
or creating some
sort of a black hole.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.333 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about your Bigfoot
experience in the Salt Fork

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.450 align:middle line:90%
State Park.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Salt
Fork Park is in Ohio.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I had a
very interesting experience

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:36.910 align:middle line:84%
with the orbs and
Bigfoot and seeing

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.310 align:middle line:90%
the combination of the two.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I was with three
other individuals,

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.200 align:middle line:90%
including Psychic Medium.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And we had witnessed
this orange orb

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:50.650 align:middle line:84%
about the size of
an apple, baseball,

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:52.197 align:middle line:90%
floating around in the forest.

00:33:52.197 --> 00:33:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we go again.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.488 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Here we go again.

00:33:54.488 --> 00:33:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you've
got to be kidding me.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.000 align:middle line:90%
I cannot believe that we're--

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing this here.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:01.420 align:middle line:90%
And I called to everybody.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:84%
We were walking from the
conference center to the cabins.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And this forest is in
between the parking area.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So it just seemed like an
odd spot for this to happen.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:90%
We went up to the tree line.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.239 align:middle line:84%
We were watching this
thing dancing around,

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.659 align:middle line:90%
and I called out to it.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:18.900 align:middle line:84%
It kind of dawned on
me that maybe this

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:22.784 align:middle line:84%
is someone wearing
a light on their hat

00:34:22.784 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:90%
and trying to mess with us.

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a miner.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Or like someone
using a red light lamp

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.310 align:middle line:90%
on their--

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.190 align:middle line:90%
night lamp on their head.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.982 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like they were
in caves and stuff.

00:34:31.982 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Right,
and so I called out

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.179 align:middle line:84%
and I said, hey, if
you're in there, come out.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:37.780 align:middle line:90%
And there was no response.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said I'm going to
throw a rock in there.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Still no response.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:42.659 align:middle line:90%
I picked up a rock.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I tossed it right
towards that light.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.409 align:middle line:84%
We then watched this
light form two eyes

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:53.039 align:middle line:84%
and a shadow that was
about eight feet tall.

00:34:53.039 --> 00:34:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And a Bigfoot materialized
in front of us.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And this thing was
rocking back and forth.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And just took the
breath out of me.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what do you
mean a Bigfoot materialized?

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: So that--

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.415 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like it came out
of a different dimension?

00:35:07.415 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: No, it's like
that orb became two eyes.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
a shadow, a form.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.450 align:middle line:90%
You could clearly see--

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Physical, or you
could put your hand through it.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah, you could see
like a head shape and a body

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.880 align:middle line:90%
shape and those--

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.370 align:middle line:84%
that light now became the
eyes of this creature.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.513 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it an
image or was it solid?

00:35:23.513 --> 00:35:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: It looked solid.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a
completely-- if you

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.630 align:middle line:84%
were to look at somebody
in the darkness,

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:84%
you could see the
silhouette of the form.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.327 align:middle line:84%
You may not be able to
make out those details,

00:35:32.327 --> 00:35:35.080 align:middle line:84%
but you could see that clearly,
there was someone standing there

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.470 align:middle line:90%
in front of us.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of the individuals
said, get ready.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.270 align:middle line:90%
They're going to surround us.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.450 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, they.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And we began to hear footsteps
and branches breaking

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:49.920 align:middle line:90%
to the right.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.755 align:middle line:84%
We were hearing the
same thing to the left.

00:35:51.755 --> 00:35:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And this thing is
still in front of us,

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just keeping
my eyes on it.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I hear all this
crunching of branches.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I turn to the left, and
there's a pool of moonlight.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And I witnessed something
walk into that light that

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:84%
had to be seven to
eight feet tall, hair,

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.270 align:middle line:84%
grayish hair, no real neck but I
could see a head and shoulders,

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.990 align:middle line:90%
walk through this thing.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Typical Bigfoot.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah,
and I turned back

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and I see Dr. Foster,
the clairvoyant medium,

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:84%
is now kind of kneeling down
and looking straight ahead.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:27.917 align:middle line:84%
And this glowing-eyed
Bigfoot is no longer there.

00:36:27.917 --> 00:36:29.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, where did it go?

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.890 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.070 align:middle line:90%
And she said, get ready.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.350 align:middle line:84%
It's going to run in
front of us from right

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:35.918 align:middle line:90%
to left in about 15 seconds.

00:36:35.918 --> 00:36:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did she know this?

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: And that's
exactly what I said.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I was like, how
do you know this?

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.325 align:middle line:90%
She's like, it just told me.

00:36:41.325 --> 00:36:42.125 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:36:42.125 --> 00:36:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "It told me"?

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: It communicated
to her via telepathy

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that it was going to
run in front of us.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.105 align:middle line:90%
And within 15 seconds--

00:36:51.105 --> 00:36:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It happened.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: It happened.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.920 align:middle line:84%
This shadow about eight feet
tall went from the right

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and crossed maybe 15, 20
feet to the other side.

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And what terrified me was not
that we were about 50 feet away

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.600 align:middle line:84%
from this, is that it moved and
we didn't hear footsteps or hear

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.970 align:middle line:90%
any of the leaves or anything.

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:16.690 align:middle line:84%
It moved like a ghost
right in front of us.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might this
explain, Ronny,

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:22.060 align:middle line:84%
why we do not have a physical
specimen of a Bigfoot?

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.908 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yes, I
believe that is--

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I've
always wondered about that.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: That's
my biggest thing.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Where are the bones?

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Where are the bodies?

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Why are all the photos
and videos blurry?

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.070 align:middle line:84%
We've witnessed this
out in the field--

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.550 align:middle line:84%
when we're near
something, our equipment

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.680 align:middle line:90%
will start shutting down.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So for me, this
interdimensional hypothesis

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.885 align:middle line:84%
about what Bigfoot
may or may not be

00:37:44.885 --> 00:37:46.573 align:middle line:90%
seems to make a lot of sense.

00:37:46.573 --> 00:37:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And you have these different
Native American stories

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:90%
connecting UFOs as well.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.127 align:middle line:84%
So I am a definite believer
that they are interdimensional.

00:37:54.127 --> 00:37:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a lot of
sightings in Leominster.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And my cousin,
Wayne, lives there.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:03.540 align:middle line:84%
His uncle on his father's side
was on one of the planes that

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.030 align:middle line:90%
hit the Twin Towers of 9/11.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.130 align:middle line:84%
He was working with
the Avid company

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.890 align:middle line:90%
and he was going to a meeting.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And the poor guy was
on the wrong plane.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:14.813 align:middle line:90%
But he's from Leominster.

00:38:14.813 --> 00:38:15.855 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Unbelievable.

00:38:15.855 --> 00:38:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Near there.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.143 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you guys could be
neighbors, for all I know.

00:38:20.143 --> 00:38:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: It's incredible.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:21.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I've got to ask
him about Bigfoot experiences

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.513 align:middle line:84%
in Leominster because I've
heard there's been a lot.

00:38:26.513 --> 00:38:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: There has.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked
to police officers

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.570 align:middle line:84%
that have had
experiences and seen one

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:90%
while they were hunting.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to other
individuals that have also seen,

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:90%
for lack of better term, elves.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Elves?

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: I've seen a
picture of something that

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:50.410 align:middle line:84%
looks about three feet
tall with boots and a hat,

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.700 align:middle line:90%
and I was blown away.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And this person is very
hesitant to share any photos,

00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.290 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want to
meet with me, but he

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:03.370 align:middle line:84%
has a bunch of evidence,
photographic evidence,

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:84%
of these smaller beings
that are around this area.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.470 align:middle line:84%
He went back to his
house and this thing

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.508 align:middle line:90%
had followed him home.

00:39:10.508 --> 00:39:12.050 align:middle line:84%
He was seeing it
out in the backyard.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:13.467 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You told
the story of how

00:39:13.467 --> 00:39:17.850 align:middle line:84%
you threw a rock in, but have
there ever been rocks thrown out

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:18.650 align:middle line:90%
at you?

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yes, it
was pretty amazing

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.620 align:middle line:90%
filming for Expedition Bigfoot.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.530 align:middle line:84%
We were out in the
Redwood Forest.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:30.673 align:middle line:84%
And again, my belief that these
things are interdimensional,

00:39:30.673 --> 00:39:32.590 align:middle line:84%
which probably means
they're a little bit more

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.190 align:middle line:90%
advanced than us.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Maybe.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.377 align:middle line:84%
I never really feel
like I'm in danger.

00:39:38.377 --> 00:39:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
seem to have technology.

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.043 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Correct.

00:39:41.043 --> 00:39:43.115 align:middle line:90%


00:39:43.115 --> 00:39:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to--
one of my things

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.680 align:middle line:84%
was to meditate
by an area that we

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:51.840 align:middle line:90%
felt like was their home area.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to be
right on the outskirts

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.420 align:middle line:84%
and see if we could
get some interest.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.795 align:middle line:84%
Maybe something
would approach me

00:39:56.795 --> 00:39:58.840 align:middle line:90%
as I'm sitting there meditating.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I then, after about
15, 20 minutes,

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.480 align:middle line:90%
felt an energy behind me.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I felt like there was
something there that

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:08.270 align:middle line:90%
wasn't there when we started.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So, at that point,
I got up and I

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:14.780 align:middle line:84%
started to walk into,
let's say, their backyard.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And as I began to do this,
a rock came flying over

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.010 align:middle line:90%
and landed right in front of me.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And it came from the spot where
I felt energy from behind.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was to
get your attention

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:25.650 align:middle line:90%
or to hit and hurt you.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: It was, in my
opinion, in many cases,

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.610 align:middle line:84%
they are doing that
to get us to get away.

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.810 align:middle line:84%
If they wanted to hit us,
they could hit us easily.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big was the rock?

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Probably about
this size, about a baseball.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would have hurt.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.587 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: It would have hurt
if I got hit by that, yeah.

00:40:41.587 --> 00:40:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And as I continued a few more
steps, another one came over.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And then a little bit more,
and the third one landed.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
was like, OK, I'm

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:56.900 align:middle line:84%
now starting to push the limits,
and maybe something negative

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.680 align:middle line:84%
will happen if I
continue further.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up
stopping at that point.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find, Ronny,
that more and more people

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.750 align:middle line:84%
are coming forward
with Bigfoot stories?

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: I have found that.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
helped with that wave

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:13.350 align:middle line:84%
has been what's been going
on in the UFO and UAP world.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.780 align:middle line:84%
I think people are realizing
that there's something

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.820 align:middle line:90%
else that's happening.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.983 align:middle line:84%
Other people have had
these similar experiences

00:41:19.983 --> 00:41:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and sightings, so they're
feeling a little bit

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.760 align:middle line:84%
more courageous to come
forward and share these things.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, on the
Expedition Bigfoot,

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.050 align:middle line:84%
you've done a lot of
work, but have there

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:33.020 align:middle line:84%
been some film clips that
never made it to the show?

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yes, I
think my first time

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.520 align:middle line:84%
joining the show, within
the first couple of days,

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.770 align:middle line:84%
being out in the
field in Oregon,

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.100 align:middle line:90%
I was getting acclimated.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
all over the map.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.115 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: All over.

00:41:46.115 --> 00:41:47.750 align:middle line:84%
We'll go to different
hotspots wherever

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.145 align:middle line:90%
we can get some evidence.

00:41:50.145 --> 00:41:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And we try to go to areas that
are very remote so there's

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:59.650 align:middle line:84%
no human interaction that
might mess up the situation.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:02.320 align:middle line:84%
We're at this particular
location in Oregon.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Myer is
being interviewed

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:06.730 align:middle line:90%
by one of the camera guys.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm off to the
side by myself,

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:12.140 align:middle line:84%
waiting for them to be
done, trying to be quiet.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I look up, and there's
a white orb flying above me,

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:19.498 align:middle line:90%
is completely silent.

00:42:19.498 --> 00:42:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a magnet.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.248 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: I don't
know what's going on.

00:42:22.248 --> 00:42:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this
thing, and I was--

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I looked back and I didn't
know if I should yell or shout.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I took out my flashlight as
this thing is flying over me

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and I hit it with
the flashlight beam.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:36.040 align:middle line:84%
It stopped in mid-air
and just hovered over me

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.870 align:middle line:84%
while I had that
flashlight on it.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:84%
When I shut off the
flashlight, maybe a beat later,

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:44.145 align:middle line:84%
it continued on and went
over the mountainside.

00:42:44.145 --> 00:42:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It probably
thought you were an orb.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:49.813 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Yeah, so they were
pretty upset when they came back

00:42:49.813 --> 00:42:51.730 align:middle line:84%
because they said you
should have yelled to us

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:90%
that you were witnessing this.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.800 align:middle line:84%
We would have run over
and started filming it.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.717 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of stuff
we're trying to get.

00:42:56.717 --> 00:42:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
your conclusion?

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Have you come to
one about Bigfoot?

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: I have.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that they
are interdimensional.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that, for
lack of a better term,

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.850 align:middle line:84%
whether we want to
call them alien or not,

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:13.240 align:middle line:84%
they definitely seem
to have this ability

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.900 align:middle line:84%
to traverse our dimension, to
disappear in a flash of light,

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.490 align:middle line:84%
but also leave
physical evidence.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:21.537 align:middle line:90%
We've gotten eDNA.

00:43:21.537 --> 00:43:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On purpose.

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: What's that?

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:23.843 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On purpose.

00:43:23.843 --> 00:43:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: On purpose, yeah.

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:29.630 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten eDNA from an
unknown primate in Kentucky

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:32.600 align:middle line:84%
from below a tree
structure that these things

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.352 align:middle line:90%
are believed to build.

00:43:34.352 --> 00:43:35.810 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the Native
American tribes

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.630 align:middle line:84%
talk about these being the
first people, the forest people,

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.400 align:middle line:90%
that they used to trade with.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to have some
abilities that maybe we

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:50.150 align:middle line:84%
had the capabilities, back in
time, that we have since lost.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But I think they're trying
to get us to reconnect

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:56.170 align:middle line:90%
with nature and spirituality.

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people have
reported that Bigfoot

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.640 align:middle line:90%
had attempted to hurt humans.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's the case.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: I don't
think so as well.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I think there's different cases
like Ape Canyon in the late

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:15.270 align:middle line:84%
'20s where there were miners
that had supposedly killed one

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and then their cabin was being
attacked by multiple Bigfoot.

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.060 align:middle line:84%
They left all their mining
equipment, everything there.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.170 align:middle line:90%
They took off.

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was an old
black-and-white photo of them,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:25.260 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Yes.

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.680 align:middle line:10%
And so you have a few of
these different stories,

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.050 align:middle line:10%
but the modern-day
experiences, there

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:35.470 align:middle line:10%
seem to be more positive
ones than anything.

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:37.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do people
find you, Ronny?

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.510 align:middle line:10%
>>LE BLANC: You can go
to ronnyleblanc.com.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:43.020 align:middle line:10%
And I try to put all my
different talks and conferences

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.960 align:middle line:10%
on there.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can also find my books,
"Monsterland", on Amazon.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And spell
Ronny Le Blanc for us.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LE BLANC: Sure.

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's Ronny, R-O-N-N-Y.
LE BLANC, L-E-B-L-A-N-C.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's the
future hold for you?

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: The
future for me is I'm

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.240 align:middle line:84%
continuing to walk through
these doors that seem

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.760 align:middle line:90%
to be opening along my path.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I want to get answers
from my own experiences.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But for the greater
good of people,

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.960 align:middle line:84%
they need to know the truth when
it comes to UFOs and Bigfoot,

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.470 align:middle line:84%
so I really want to be
a messenger of sorts

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:19.203 align:middle line:84%
and try to see if we can work
together to find out the truth.

00:45:19.203 --> 00:45:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're a
great messenger, to be sure.

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Ronny, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.118 align:middle line:84%
>>LE BLANC: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:45:25.118 --> 00:45:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He must be a magnet
because orbs and Bigfoot seem

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:29.740 align:middle line:90%
to travel wherever he is.

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking
around the studio

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.650 align:middle line:90%
to see if there's anything.

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I haven't found one
yet, but you never know.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
