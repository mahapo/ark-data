>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:10%
1947, in a cave in Palestine,
which is now Israel,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:10%
a discovery of the
Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:10%
a discovery that has
changed the face of mankind.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest,
Dr. Ken Hanson.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>For most of the
last 2,000 years,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
the apocalyptic Dead
Sea Scrolls were lost.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And even when they were
found, they were available

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:90%
only to scholars.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.770 align:middle line:84%
One man has made it
his mission to breathe

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
new life into the scrolls,
focusing on the value of one

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
in particular-- the
War Scroll Ken Hanson,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and author of "Dead Sea
Scrolls-- The Untold Story,"

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.620 align:middle line:84%
teaches Judaic studies at the
University of Central Florida.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:84%
He believes the scrolls
are a treasure which can

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.590 align:middle line:90%
provide insights into humanity.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:84%
He explains how the War Scroll
anticipated modern conflict

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
in the Middle East and how,
if we heed it, can offer help.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.144 align:middle line:90%
Today on Beyond Belief.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Ken Hanson.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:10%
Ken, thanks for being our guest.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KEN HANSON: It's
a great pleasure.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know what?

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:84%
We have talked for years on the
"Coast to Coast" radio show.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.458 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: That's right.

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But to be able
to meet you in person

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and see these incredible
artifacts is absolutely

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:90%
riveting.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:90%
It really is exciting.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.891 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Isn't it
great to have the chance

00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:38.756 align:middle line:84%
to actually show
and not just tell?

00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:10%
That's what the
artifacts can bring us,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:10%
is a chance to peer into
this ancient time and culture

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:10%
and civilization.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's go back to 1947.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Who discovered the Dead Sea
Scrolls in these jars, right?

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Right.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.750 align:middle line:10%
Like so many great discoveries,
it happened all by accident

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:10%
when a young
Bedouin shepherd boy

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:10%
named Muhammed edh-Dhib
was looking for a lost

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:10%
goat on the western shore
of the Dead Sea-- the lowest

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:10%
spot on the face of
the Earth, by the way.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't find his goat.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
He's rummaging around through
a series of lonely desert

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.600 align:middle line:84%
caves perched high
above the Dead Sea

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:90%
in the chalky marl cliffs.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
He throws a stone
into one of them,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
hoping that if his
goat has gone astray,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
he'll frighten the
animal out into the open.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And instead what he hears is
the sound of something cracking,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:90%
breaking, like cracking pottery.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing to him.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:10%
He hauls his frail torso
halfway up the side of the cliff

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.100 align:middle line:10%
and squeezes through the very
narrow cave entrance and peers

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:10%
into the darkness.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.423 align:middle line:10%
And there, leaning along
this darkened inner recess

00:02:50.423 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:10%
of the cave, he sees a series
of earthenware pottery jars.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.800 align:middle line:84%
His stone has
struck one of them.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
That was the sound
that he heard.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:84%
He summons his courage and
starts rifling through them

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and finds a big, oddly-wrapped
bundle of something.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know what it is.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:90%
He hauls it out of the cave.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.470 align:middle line:84%
He's worried about desert
ghosts and goblins,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:84%
hightails it back to
his desert campsite,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and pulls away the
flaxen covering

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:84%
to be confronted by a
series of parchments.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Of course, his native
tongue is Arabic.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And he does not understand the
Hebrew on these parchments.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know what they are.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:90%
He shows his friends.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:84%
They just roll up
their curiosities again

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and stuff them into a series
of big old leather bags

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:90%
and hang them from tent poles.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
took all the jars.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:90%
All of them?

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.733 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: He took
some of them, and he

00:03:48.733 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:84%
took the contents, the major
contents of one of the jars,

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Most of the jars were empty.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:84%
He took the contents,
and he had no idea.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they saw
the light of day.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
The Bedouin wandered around
through the wilderness of Judea

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
for weeks, carrying the scrolls
dangling from a tent pole.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they found
their way to Bethlehem,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
to a shopkeeper, an
Arab shopkeeper-- Arab

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.269 align:middle line:84%
Christian-- who bought a
few of them on the spot.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:84%
And then the shopkeeper
makes his own expedition back

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.266 align:middle line:84%
to those caves and
finds even more.

00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And so you end up
with a whole treasure

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.787 align:middle line:90%
trove of assorted parchments.

00:04:27.787 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Here's a facsimile of what one
of them might have looked like.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these
written, Ken, by one person?

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:90%
Or by a series of people?

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Oh, by a
whole series of people.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:84%
One of them might,
in fact, have been

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
the founder of the
ancient sect itself known

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.390 align:middle line:90%
as the Teacher of Righteousness.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the only name
he's ever given,

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:90%
the Teacher of Righteousness.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
He's sort of a
mysterious-- I liken him

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.171 align:middle line:84%
to Obi-Wan Kenobi
2,000 years ago.

00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could that
have been Jesus?

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.940 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Well, some have
tried to make that argument,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:10%
have tried to make
the connection,

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:10%
although bear in mind
most of these parchments,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:10%
by carbon-14 dating as well as
the handwriting analysis, date

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:10%
to the first two centuries
BC, well before Jesus.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So I see them then
as a pre-Jesus sect.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.380 align:middle line:84%
If these were written
before the birth of Jesus,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:90%
what did the scrolls say?

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.530 align:middle line:90%
What were they all about?

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.029 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, for
one thing, we've

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
got copies of at
least portions of each

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and every book of
the Hebrew Bible,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:84%
the Old Testament, including
the books of Moses.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
But then we have
scores and scores

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:84%
of additional texts,
entire books that we never

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:90%
even knew existed.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:10%
And yet all of them date
from this seminal period

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:10%
of the days of Jesus and
John the Baptist and King

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.470 align:middle line:10%
Herod the Great and the
Romans-- rule books, manuals.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.740 align:middle line:10%
One is called the
Manual of Discipline,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:10%
what you would have to do
to join this ancient sect.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:10%
If you want to become
a member of the sect--

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:10%
we call them the Essenes.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.849 align:middle line:10%
That's the most likely
designation of who they were.

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:10%
If you wanted to become
an Essene yourself,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.598 align:middle line:10%
what do you have to do?

00:06:06.598 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:10%
What are the hoops you
have to jump through?

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
An extensive three-year
probation period--

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I heard
Jesus was an Essene.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And some have
tried to argue that.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I think, more likely, John
the Baptist was an Essene.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at a
video to give all of us

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:90%
a little glance at the Essene.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:10%
>>Like earlier messianic rebels
who got in the way of Rome,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.086 align:middle line:10%
the Essenes met a violent end.

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:10%
Josephus tells that they
were tortured in order,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:10%
he wrote, to induce them
to blaspheme or to eat

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:10%
some forbidden thing.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:10%
But they refused to yield,
nor ever once did they

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.718 align:middle line:10%
cringe or shed a tear.

00:06:48.718 --> 00:06:51.120 align:middle line:10%
Cheerfully, they
resigned their souls,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:10%
confident that they would
receive them back again.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:07:00.907 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, though that may
have been an exciting time

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:84%
period, it may have also
been a very treacherous time

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.805 align:middle line:84%
period, especially if
you were an Essene.

00:07:09.805 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Especially.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.860 align:middle line:10%
But the whole land of Israel
was in turmoil in those days,

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:10%
and that means throughout
the days of Jesus and John

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.890 align:middle line:10%
the Baptist.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:84%
I think, as I mentioned, John
the Baptist, the baptizer,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:84%
might have been a
member of this sect,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.730 align:middle line:84%
just based on the type of
preaching that he did-- talking

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.900 align:middle line:84%
about fire, about judgment,
about an apocalyptic end

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
of the age, the
end of all things.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:10%
That's very much in line
with the kind of material

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:10%
we read in these
ancient scrolls,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:10%
especially, as we're
talking about today, the War

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:10%
Scroll, which seems to
predict, to portend,

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:51.590 align:middle line:10%
a series of seven great end-time
apocalyptic battles, wars.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Does it echo
the Book of Revelation?

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Very much, except
it's written, I'd say,

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:10%
at least a century before
the Book of Revelation

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.084 align:middle line:10%
and yet sounds
hauntingly similar.

00:08:03.084 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle line:10%
The difference, of course,
is the Book of Revelation

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:10%
came down to us in Greek.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:10%
It's as though we have
a Hebrew antecedent

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:10%
of the Book of
Revelation, very much

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.180 align:middle line:10%
on the same page
in many, many ways.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:10%
The apocalypse is imminent.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.170 align:middle line:10%
Doom, catastrophe
of some kind-- they

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:10%
knew not what-- is
right around the corner.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.950 align:middle line:10%
And history bore them out.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When do you think
the Dead Sea Scrolls were

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:84%
put in these clay pots and
then hidden away in this cave?

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Everything
is a controversy

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.500 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to this research.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
My take is that thanks
to their War Scroll,

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:84%
thanks to their own prophesies
of the soon-coming destruction

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:84%
to fall upon the land
of Israel, they decided,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:90%
we had better hide these.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:84%
We had better hide them, and
quick because the Romans--

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or they'd be destroyed.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.551 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Everything,
everyone will be destroyed.

00:08:57.551 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:90%
The Romans are coming.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:84%
A great revolt against
the Roman Empire

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:84%
broke out in the land of
Israel in the year 66 AD.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:84%
It went on for four
horrible years until 70 AD.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Josephus, the ancient
historian, tells us

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:84%
that over one million Israelites
perished in that revolt.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:90%
That's Holocaust proportions.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.328 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Unbelievable.

00:09:20.328 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bigger because of
the population at the time.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Exactly, exactly.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And they had an
uncanny awareness.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.180 align:middle line:84%
God knows how, but they had
a sense that this is coming.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And the dating of the
scrolls prove it, in fact.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Will beforehand, they knew
what was coming down the pike.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And they took their
parchments, and they hid them

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:90%
in a series of jars.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:10%
Some they just rolled out
flat, one on top of another,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.810 align:middle line:10%
in the bottom one
of these caves,

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.879 align:middle line:10%
and then covered it
over with sand and dirt.

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To preserve
them and protect them.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And left it there
for 2,000 years, thinking,

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.580 align:middle line:90%
we'll come back.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
They did something else
very, very interesting.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Either the Essenes
or someone like them

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
decided it is time to
hide our treasures.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And this may have included the
treasures of the sacred temple

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.850 align:middle line:90%
in Jerusalem itself.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:23.880 align:middle line:84%
The temple, Herod's temple,
was the most wealthy, opulent

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.322 align:middle line:90%
building, perhaps, in the world.

00:10:25.322 --> 00:10:27.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is this the Temple
Mount were talking about?

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: The Temple Mount
today, which is how all of this

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.845 align:middle line:10%
really dovetails into
modern geopolitics.

00:10:31.845 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It really does.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.429 align:middle line:10%
It never changed.

00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: This is the bullseye
of history, I like to call it,

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:10%
even as we speak.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
That Temple Mount held the
most lavish structure, really,

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:90%
known to the world.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Nothing has been seen like it.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:84%
The same historian,
Josephus, said,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
he who has not seen
the temple in Jerusalem

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.460 align:middle line:84%
has not seen a truly
beautiful building.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the scrolls--
and they haven't interpreted

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.470 align:middle line:90%
all of them, have they not?

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:90%
They've got them all.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: They've got them all.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they haven't
deciphered them all.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.526 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well,
we have databases,

00:11:04.526 --> 00:11:07.360 align:middle line:84%
in fact, of these scrolls,
including tens of thousands

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:84%
of tiny little pieces
of parchment fragment

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
that were later
discovered by the Bedouin

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.490 align:middle line:84%
as part of this Judean desert
scroll rush that came in.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the world's
biggest jigsaw puzzle.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.140 align:middle line:90%
And we have them all now.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:84%
For nearly 40 years, they were
all sequestered, we should add.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
a tragic development

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.150 align:middle line:84%
because only a select handful
of scholars in the whole world

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.070 align:middle line:90%
had access.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of controversy raged.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:90%
But they have come out.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:90%
They have come out.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And we have them.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:90%
As I say, there are databases.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:90%
I have one.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
we understand them all.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean we're still
able to piece them all together

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.060 align:middle line:90%
exactly in the right order.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
scientific process,

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
to piece together
the jigsaw puzzle,

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:90%
and then to make sense of it.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about this
temple and its treasure.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.990 align:middle line:10%
Somebody decided
that they would make

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.120 align:middle line:10%
an inventory of this treasure,
hide this treasure somewhere

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:10%
out in the wilderness
of Judea for safekeeping

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:10%
because they really believed
that the end of things

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:10%
was at hand.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:10%
The Romans-- or the war scroll
just calls them the Kittim.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a specialized term.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And we believe they
were the Romans.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:84%
The Kittim are coming,
whoever they are.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And they pounded the
contents of this treasure

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
into sheets of very pure,
highly-refined copper.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And then riveted one sheet
of copper into the next

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:90%
into the next.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a facsimile of
what the famous Copper

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Scroll would have looked like.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.516 align:middle line:90%
They etched onto the copper.

00:12:38.516 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: They
pounded, literally,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.100 align:middle line:84%
the Hebrew letters into the
copper-- very hurriedly,

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
it looks like-- and pounded
one sheet into another.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It was a high grade of
copper, malleable, capable

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:90%
of being rolled into a scroll.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why was it so important
to put these messages down

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:90%
on copper?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So that it
would be preserved,

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
even if some terrible
thing happens

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.270 align:middle line:84%
to our other parchments,
which are basically just--

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.115 align:middle line:90%
they're vellum.

00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:90%
They're parchment material.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
They're the skin
of kosher animals.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.606 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
our software backups.

00:13:07.606 --> 00:13:08.406 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:08.406 --> 00:13:09.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the cloud.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Bingo.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a copper cloud.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is likely to
survive, whatever happens.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.820 align:middle line:10%
We've got to be able to go
back and get our treasure, more

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:10%
than 200 tons of gold and silver
and consecrated artifacts,

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:10%
from the sacred temple,
along with precise locations

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.247 align:middle line:10%
where they were buried
in the city of Jerusalem.

00:13:29.247 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Have we found them yet?

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.163 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: And the
wilderness of Judea.

00:13:32.163 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:10%
Well when the archaeologists
first uncovered this Copper

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:10%
Scroll-- and happened
in the 1950s,

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:10%
mind you, because as part of
this scroll rush, I call it,

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.300 align:middle line:10%
everyone is going
back to these caves.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:45.800 align:middle line:90%
What else is out there?

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looking for things.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.578 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Looking for things.

00:13:47.578 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:84%
One cave entrance had actually
collapsed in antiquity,

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:84%
sealing its contents
also from the outside.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they get into it?

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And the
archeologists--

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.040 align:middle line:84%
not the Bedouin, the
archeologists-- found this one.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Then they dug through that
collapsed cave entrance,

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.687 align:middle line:84%
and they found in two
pieces the Copper Scroll.

00:14:03.687 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a discovery.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And proceeded
first to try to unroll it.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And the copper, of
course, had oxidized.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't unroll it.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.791 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And this is a replica.

00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: This is
a replica, yes.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, they
resorted to sawing it

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:84%
into little arcs, which they
laid one next to another next

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
to another until they finally
got the whole thing laid

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.300 align:middle line:90%
out and in the open.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:10%
They inadvertently sawed
through some of the letters.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, no!

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.061 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Because
they couldn't tell.

00:14:30.061 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:10%
But it was the only way.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:10%
And then they began to
transcribe the contents.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were
astounded, when they're

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:84%
reading, about enormous
amounts of gold and silver,

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.490 align:middle line:84%
sacred vessels from the temple
and where they're located--

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.671 align:middle line:90%
in the cistern and so on.

00:14:46.671 --> 00:14:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe somebody
does have them now, Ken.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The archaeologists
dropped everything and ran out

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:84%
into the desert with metal
detectors-- I kid you

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:90%
not-- looking for this.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:84%
One scholar in particular named
John Allegro wrote a whole book

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.942 align:middle line:90%
about it, trying to find it.

00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:03.400 align:middle line:84%
This would be the
most incredible--

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
were not successful?

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.160 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: To date, not a
trace of the treasury--

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We don't think.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.817 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: --has
ever come to light.

00:15:09.817 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:10%
Well, unless someone else
found it at some point--

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:12.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And kept it quite.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: --in history.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:10%
But how on Earth would you
keep something like that quiet,

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:10%
even if they tried
to keep it quiet?

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:84%
The Romans had a
great sea battle

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that took place between
Octavian and the Mark Antony.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Cleopatra, of
course, was involved.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.320 align:middle line:90%
And Octavian won.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Well the, treasure of
Cleopatra-- it was enormous--

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.800 align:middle line:84%
was confiscated in
that sea battle.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.460 align:middle line:90%
It was brought back to Rome.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could
keep that quiet.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It actually caused a spike in
inflation in the city of Rome.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't keep things
like that quiet.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:84%
So I cannot imagine anyone
finding this in antiquity.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Some have argued maybe
it was all just a hoax,

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.760 align:middle line:90%
a fabrication of some kind.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:10%
But why go to the trouble
of inscribing something

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:10%
like on sheets--

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And then folding it up.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Exactly.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:84%
There are still, there
are ongoing attempts,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.115 align:middle line:84%
even as we speak, to
locate the treasure.

00:16:11.115 --> 00:16:13.154 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: More of these
and the treasure.

00:16:13.154 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: One friend
of mine thinks they

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.477 align:middle line:84%
even the Ark of the Covenant
might be among the items.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, what a
discovery that would be.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.935 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Wouldn't
that be a discovery?

00:16:20.935 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the Dead
Sea Scrolls specifically,

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
do they talk about the
life of Jesus to come?

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Not specifically.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, people have tried to
link him with the scrolls.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he was an Essene.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he lived with them
when he was growing up

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
in part of the silent
years of his life.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that Jesus
actually refers

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:84%
to this sect in his own
teaching in the Gospels.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.620 align:middle line:84%
But unlike John the Baptist--
this is my take, mind you.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Everything's
debated-- who I think

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:84%
was perhaps a member of the
sect, Jesus I don't think

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.270 align:middle line:90%
liked the sect.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Because whereas
John the Baptist was

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:84%
fixated on this horrible
image of future catastrophe,

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Jesus-- even from the Gospels,
what is he accused of being?

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
A winebibber,
gluttonous man, friend

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.650 align:middle line:90%
of publicans and sinners.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.589 align:middle line:10%
This sect lived a very
exclusivistic life

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:17.670 align:middle line:10%
out in the middle of
nowhere in the desert.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.971 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Almost like monks.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, actually,
some have likened them

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:84%
to Jewish ancient monks, if
you could imagine such a thing,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:90%
which is really bizarre.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
But that has been one possible
parallel into what they were.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:84%
But Jesus liked to
be among the folks.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And when he quotes the Dead
Sea Scrolls-- and he does--

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.850 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be in the negative,
as if don't seclude yourself

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:42.800 align:middle line:90%
from the world.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Jesus says make friends of
the mammon of unrighteousness.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.695 align:middle line:90%
That's a New Testament quote.

00:17:47.695 --> 00:17:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's be out there
among the people.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the scrolls
predictors of what could be?

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Or are they merely stories
of what was happening?

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, in
the academic world,

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.820 align:middle line:84%
it's a shame, because all
we're really allowed to do

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:84%
is look at this stuff as
literature, literary analysis.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Made up by somebody?

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yes.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm an academic, and
I engage in this, too.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.670 align:middle line:10%
I write my articles along
with everybody else.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's a shame because
as academics, we're

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:19.490 align:middle line:84%
really not allowed to delve
into what the writers themselves

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:90%
might have experienced.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they mean?

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: What were
they are experiencing?

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This wasn't
a novel, for example.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: I don't think it was.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The
scholar I mentioned,

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.140 align:middle line:84%
John Allegro, who actually
did his own search

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:84%
for the treasure of
the Copper Scroll,

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:84%
began to get into
this as a scholar.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:10%
And he questioned,
raised the possibility

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:10%
that the members of this
sect might, in fact, have

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:10%
been consuming certain
types of natural vegetation,

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.870 align:middle line:10%
specifically mushrooms--

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ah, the magic mushroom.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: --in the area.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Well, bingo.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:10%
That were brought into the
Middle East in antiquity

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:04.260 align:middle line:10%
and that actually help to
promote certain psychic, even

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:10%
hallucinogenic, experiences.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And John Allegro really
began to probe into this.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And immediately,
he lost credibility

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:90%
in the academic world.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a shame
because we need to ask--

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He may
have been right on.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.205 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, he
might have been.

00:19:17.205 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:84%
When you put yourself in
another state of consciousness,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.970 align:middle line:84%
you open yourself to another
level, another world,

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:84%
another dimension,
and, the way I see it,

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.580 align:middle line:90%
as cyclical prophecies.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Prophecies never have
a single fulfillment.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:90%
They are multiple.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And even Jesus, when he
talks about the end--

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and he does
occasionally reference

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.720 align:middle line:84%
the end of all
things-- he invariably

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:84%
links the end of days with what
we have suffered in the past.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Jesus talks about the
abomination of desolation

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.520 align:middle line:90%
standing in the holy place.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize
there had already

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.825 align:middle line:84%
been an abomination
of desolation

00:19:57.825 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:84%
two centuries
before, a guy named

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Antiochus Epiphanes came
and defiled the temple

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and proclaimed
himself to be God.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So there are cyclical
fulfillments.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with us moderns
is that we want everything

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.490 align:middle line:90%
to have one single answer.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.880 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what it means,
and it must mean nothing else.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
When instead, we
should be trying

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:84%
to get into the
mind of the writers

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and look for patterns
and archetypes,

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.580 align:middle line:84%
recognizing, as
Terence McKenna used

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:90%
to say-- the famed philosopher.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:90%
They called him psychonaut.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:84%
He says that these are
experiences that cannot be

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:90%
caught in a rational net.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And every time we try
to, it escapes us.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But what we can do
is to see points

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:48.030 align:middle line:84%
in history where this
apocalyptic scenario has indeed

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:90%
fulfilled.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's a
stretch to say we might be

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle line:90%
on another cycle of apocalypse.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the
Dead Sea War Scroll

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.592 align:middle line:84%
has a incredible likeness
to the Book of Revelation.

00:21:02.592 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yes, it does.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.655 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:21:05.655 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:10%
>>The scrolls are apocalyptic,
militant, and aggressive.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.495 align:middle line:10%
Interpreters of
the scrolls suggest

00:21:12.495 --> 00:21:15.240 align:middle line:10%
that a belief in a
coming apocalypse

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:10%
may have inspired the Essenes
to create the War Scroll, which

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:24.490 align:middle line:10%
they believed to be an ancient
blueprint on the art of war.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.040 align:middle line:10%
But could it also be
interpreted as a prophecy

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:10%
of a future Armageddon.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:10%
Evidence may lie in the War
Scroll's text, which lays out

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:10%
a framework for a violent
confrontation between two

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:10%
opposing forces.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:10%
The opening lines
of the text read--

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:10%
>>The first attack
of the sons of light

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:10%
shall be undertaken against the
forces of the sons of darkness.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.950 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Ken, what
the heck does that mean?

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Think Star Wars.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.170 align:middle line:10%
It's a beautiful comparison.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.530 align:middle line:10%
The force, the dark side.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.100 align:middle line:84%
The Dead Sea sect,
whoever they were,

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.820 align:middle line:84%
were consumed by
the idea of dualism,

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.930 align:middle line:84%
that there are cosmic forces
unleashed in the universe doing

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:90%
battle with one another.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And we can tap into
one or the other.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, the world itself may be
consumed by forces of darkness.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Three of these
seven battles will

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:84%
be won by the so-called sons
of darkness, whoever they are.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Three more battles
will be won by the sons

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.680 align:middle line:84%
of light, which
presumably refers

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:90%
to the Essenes themselves.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have these battles
occurred in some part

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
already, like World
War I, World War II?

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Some
interpret it that way.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have
to be careful not

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.030 align:middle line:84%
to get too definite because
we try to pin something down.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Again, it can't be caught
in the net of the rational.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:90%
It escapes us.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
rabbis, for example,

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and Orthodox rabbis down
through the ages, who--

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily with reference
to the War Scroll-- nonetheless

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.490 align:middle line:84%
have said we believe that
this is the final apocalypse.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Some have pointed to the
mystical book, the Zohar,

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:84%
which is the heart
of Jewish Kabbalah,

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that talks about a final
period of the 70 years

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.140 align:middle line:84%
in which things will get
worse and worse and worse,

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and then a really
horrific period.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hmm, sounds like now.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.308 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Well, it sure does.

00:23:23.308 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Of 45-- of, well,
first nine months,

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
almost like birth pangs
of the Messianic Age.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And then the last 45 days
will be the absolute worst.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:37.240 align:middle line:84%
There were Orthodox rabbis
who said during the Holocaust,

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:90%
this is it.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.860 align:middle line:84%
We are experiencing
this right now.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:90%
This is the 70 years spoken of.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Only trouble is, we are
well beyond 70 years now

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:90%
past the Holocaust.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have
to be careful not to try

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:90%
to make things too definite.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:90%
These are patterns.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:90%
These are archetypes.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I think that the Holocaust
was an event in human history

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:90%
unlike any other.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.680 align:middle line:10%
And if we can accept
the notion of warnings

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:10%
from some other
dimension-- we have

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:10%
to get a little bit
beyond our own psyche

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:10%
here, beyond our
own intellectualism

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.780 align:middle line:10%
and our scholarliness and
try to connect with something

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.270 align:middle line:10%
beyond ourselves-- who can
doubt that this was not

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.424 align:middle line:10%
some kind of apocalyptic
scenario in the Holocaust?

00:24:22.424 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It is
frightening, though, Ken.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:28.140 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: And then, when
we imagine another round.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.100 align:middle line:10%
We're well beyond the 70 years.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:10%
But we're looking at
another round as we speak.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And it all relates back
to the Middle East,

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.090 align:middle line:84%
back to the city
of Jerusalem, back

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
to the Temple Mount, which is
the bullseye of history today.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:90%
And the warnings are out there.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And we better not be so academic
that we can't heed them.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.776 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
at some of the prophecies

00:24:51.776 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:90%
of the Dead War Scrolls.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.680 align:middle line:10%
>>According to some
scholars, the War Scroll

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.520 align:middle line:10%
suggests that so-called
darkness, the evil enemy

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:10%
of all good people, is without
morals and guided by greed.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:10%
In the War Scroll, the sons of
darkness's immoral and greedy

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.060 align:middle line:10%
leader has a name-- Belial.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.957 align:middle line:10%
>>Cursed is Belial for
his contentious purpose

00:25:18.957 --> 00:25:22.185 align:middle line:10%
and accursed for his
reprehensible rule.

00:25:22.185 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:10%
And cursed are all
the spirits of his lot

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:10%
for their wicked purpose.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.202 align:middle line:90%


00:25:28.202 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, what
we don't know is

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:34.070 align:middle line:84%
whether that was meant for that
time period or the future time

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.302 align:middle line:90%
period, where we are now.

00:25:35.302 --> 00:25:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: They were
convinced that it was

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:90%
meant for their time period.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And so were many of the
writers of the New Testament.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.880 align:middle line:84%
They were convinced the
second coming was exactly

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.355 align:middle line:90%
in that time period, for them.

00:25:48.355 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:84%
But if we understand
what I'm talking about,

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.270 align:middle line:84%
archetypes, they weren't
wrong in thinking

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.550 align:middle line:90%
that it was for them.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:84%
This revolt was right
around the corner.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:84%
How uncanny is it that
they imagined this kind

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:90%
of apocalypse in their own day?

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.920 align:middle line:84%
As far as the Judeo-Christian
community is concerned,

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:90%
they expected it, too.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.210 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Revelation
that we talked about

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:12.922 align:middle line:84%
has some haunting references to
the great revolt against Rome.

00:26:12.922 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:10%
Modern readers don't
catch the references

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.510 align:middle line:10%
because we don't
know our history.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Not at all.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.966 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: But I'm convinced
the whole Book of Revelation--

00:26:18.966 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:10%
almost all of it-- is
about what happened

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:10%
in that great revolt as warnings
to get out while we can.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And there is an ancient
Christian tradition

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.330 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, the
early Judeo-Christians

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:84%
of the city of Jerusalem
heeded those warnings.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And they left right
before the Romans arrived.

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:41.450 align:middle line:84%
They went east across the
Jordan River, which actually

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:90%
was in low ebb at the moment.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And they able to get across
before the flood came

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and settled in a Jordanian
locale today we called Pella.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.840 align:middle line:90%
It's an ancient site.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a very ancient tradition.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.019 align:middle line:84%
But they had all
of this in mind.

00:26:56.019 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, what
if these were just

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:84%
great stories
written by people who

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.420 align:middle line:90%
just wanted to scare others?

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I envision they
wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and then they read them to
the population at the time,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.650 align:middle line:84%
almost like the
story of the night.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:13.927 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:27:13.927 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: They
circulated, definitely,

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:84%
among the people of
Jerusalem in that day.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.210 align:middle line:84%
There are certain aspects
of that revolt that

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.760 align:middle line:84%
defy explanation unless they
really believed that it was

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.970 align:middle line:90%
part of some supernatural plan.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:30.130 align:middle line:84%
The final seventh
battle was to be

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:84%
won by the almighty, who will
descend from on high with--

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The apocalypse.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --a host
of angelic beings.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Call them interdimensional
beings, if you will.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:10%
Angels, whatever, who will
come down and win it on behalf

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.660 align:middle line:10%
of the sons of light of.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.459 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Of course, it
didn't pan out that way.

00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:50.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yet.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Yet.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:10%
But today, Israel feels more
surrounded by hostile nations,

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:10%
hostile forces, then ever.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:10%
But the tools of writing these
parchments have come down to us

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.150 align:middle line:10%
generation to generation from
2,000-year-old parchments.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:10%
The same type of techniques were
used to write the Hebrew Bible.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:15.790 align:middle line:10%
And if I could just--

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And you can read
ancient Hebrew, can't you?

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:18.840 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Yes, I lived--

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Could you
read a little bit?

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.465 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Sure, sure.

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:21.681 align:middle line:10%
I've lived in Israel.

00:28:21.681 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, modern Hebrew
that we speak in Israel today,

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.567 align:middle line:84%
is virtually unchanged
from ancient Hebrew.

00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:29.900 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is, I need to
put on my Indiana Jones hat

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:84%
here out of Jewish
tradition because whenever

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:84%
we read a text, you
put on your yarmulke

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.050 align:middle line:90%
or you just cover your head.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.809 align:middle line:90%
So I'll have my Indie hat here.

00:28:38.809 --> 00:28:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should I hold that
up for you, or you're good?

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Sure.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.594 align:middle line:84%
You can help hold it
up, being careful not

00:28:44.594 --> 00:28:45.760 align:middle line:90%
to touch any of the letters.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.580 align:middle line:90%
Just that one end of it.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:52.439 align:middle line:84%
And this happens to be
a scroll fragment from--

00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old is this?

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: This is
about 300 years old.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this is a
replica of an original?

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.175 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It's a copy of a
copy of a copy of a copy, made

00:29:02.175 --> 00:29:02.975 align:middle line:90%
in the Ukraine.

00:29:02.975 --> 00:29:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By hand?

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And we can think of this, which
is a replica of a Dead Sea

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Scroll, as the great, great,
great, great, great grandfather

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
the material here?

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The
material is vellum.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the skin of
any kosher animal.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.700 align:middle line:90%
It can be cow, deer.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.060 align:middle line:90%
As long as it's a kosher animal.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kosher is a
blessed animal, right?

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That does not-- right,
is not a scavenger animal,

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.910 align:middle line:90%
for example, that chews the cud.

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So just read us a
little paragraph,

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:28.400 align:middle line:90%
something significant here.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So this is from the
Book of Deuteronomy, right?

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And it survived the
Holocaust, I should add.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.140 align:middle line:84%
This happens to contain
the first three of the Ten

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Commandments.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:90%
It says-- [SPEAKING HEBREW]

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:84%
I am the Lord, your
God, who brought you out

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:84%
of the land of Egypt, out
of the house of bondage.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how
would they know--

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.030 align:middle line:84%
if this was one of the
Ten Commandments, how

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:84%
would they know to
inscript this here?

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: This is part
of the entire text

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.410 align:middle line:90%
of the Book of Deuteronomy.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So the entire
scroll would consist

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
of the five books of Moses,
Genesis through Deuteronomy,

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:90%
written by a single hand.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.460 align:middle line:84%
It takes about three years to
inscribe the whole narrative.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And the narrative is ongoing
until it just happens

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.899 align:middle line:90%
to come here, to this part.

00:30:18.899 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes out and
says-- [SPEAKING HEBREW]

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:90%


00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.560 align:middle line:84%
You shall not have any other
gods before you or, literally,

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.570 align:middle line:90%
before my face.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.445 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's part of
the Ten Commandments.

00:30:30.445 --> 00:30:32.403 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And there's
one more passage, really,

00:30:32.403 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:84%
that is very prominent
and powerful, also

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:36.760 align:middle line:90%
from the Book of Deuteronomy.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:90%
This is another fragment.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's right in the middle.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.160 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the only
messianic prophecies

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.720 align:middle line:84%
in all of the Hebrew Bible,
in all of the books of Moses

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.530 align:middle line:90%
certainly.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And it starts right here, again
from the Book of Deuteronomy.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:51.980 align:middle line:90%
It says--

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING HEBREW]

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:57.690 align:middle line:90%


00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:01.960 align:middle line:84%
For the Lord your God
shall bring forth to you

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:06.580 align:middle line:84%
a prophet from among you,
from among your brethren.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:90%
This is a messianic reference.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And then it says a
single word-- [HEBREW].

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:16.245 align:middle line:84%
Moses is speaking, a prophet
like me, like Moses, a messiah

00:31:16.245 --> 00:31:17.045 align:middle line:90%
figure.

00:31:17.045 --> 00:31:17.845 align:middle line:90%
[HEBREW]

00:31:17.845 --> 00:31:20.850 align:middle line:90%


00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:90%
The Lord shall raise up for you.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Then it says [HEBREW].

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Unto him shall you
listen or hearken.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can tell you in the
period of the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:33.250 align:middle line:84%
there was a virtual
messianic mania.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:37.220 align:middle line:84%
They were waiting for
someone, or, quite possibly,

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.720 align:middle line:84%
for two messiahs, who
would come up like Moses

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and lead the people
in redemption.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, these were
eyewitnesses, these people.

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Well, sure.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They saw
incredible things.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: They saw
incredible things.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And the tradition
preserved, almost verbatim,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.910 align:middle line:84%
from Dead Sea Scrolls, almost
word for word identical to what

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.840 align:middle line:84%
has come down in
subsequent parchments.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
message there for us,

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.400 align:middle line:90%
for us today to take heed?

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Of course.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.742 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we need to take heed to
what the prophets have always

00:32:11.742 --> 00:32:12.700 align:middle line:90%
been trying to tell us.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And that means to step
beyond our own rationalism

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.250 align:middle line:90%
for just a few minutes.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's difficult
for me as a scholar

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:21.510 align:middle line:84%
to say this because
all we deal with

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:84%
are just texts and
textual analysis.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:28.250 align:middle line:84%
But when we're talking about
a Messianic Age, a messiah who

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:31.720 align:middle line:84%
will rise, actually there
are two traditions in Judaism

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.900 align:middle line:90%
about the Messiah.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.740 align:middle line:10%
Either he will come
as a conquering hero

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:10%
or he will come, as Zechariah
the prophet tells us,

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.320 align:middle line:10%
on an ass.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:10%
And it's up to us
and our conduct

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.970 align:middle line:10%
to decide which
way he will come.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they talk
about the Antichrist

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:90%
in any of these writings?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: More so when we
get to the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:57.170 align:middle line:84%
We just saw a clip about
[HEBREW] or Belial,

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:58.860 align:middle line:84%
or "Beel-ee-al," as
he was pronounced--

00:32:58.860 --> 00:32:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
the devil, doesn't it?

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.538 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: It sure does.

00:33:00.538 --> 00:33:01.500 align:middle line:90%
It sure does.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.620 align:middle line:90%
A force of great malevolence.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The term itself means "without
a yoke." [HEBREW] is a yoke.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Without a yoke, like an
animal who has no yoke.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.010 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when
people are unrestrained,

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:20.830 align:middle line:84%
when they've cast away the
admonitions of the Torah,

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.900 align:middle line:84%
the books of Moses,
the Pentateuch,

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:28.790 align:middle line:84%
the ideas that keep
us moral, that we

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
are unrestrained and
can produce no end

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.954 align:middle line:84%
of evil-- the evil inclination,
as Judaism calls it.

00:33:35.954 --> 00:33:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what's
amazing, too, Ken,

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.150 align:middle line:84%
is you've talked about
Jerusalem in the past.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And Jerusalem in the
future and Jerusalem

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:47.450 align:middle line:84%
in our present state, that is
a focal point for all of this.

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at it today.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:52.300 align:middle line:90%


00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:10%
>>Jerusalem is my
home, where I was born.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.310 align:middle line:10%
It's the place where
we live and learn.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.010 align:middle line:10%
We can't do without it.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:02.060 align:middle line:10%
We draw affection from it.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.570 align:middle line:10%
It's like a mother to us.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>I hate to say this,
but everybody just

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.330 align:middle line:90%
seemed suspicious to me.

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:13.810 align:middle line:10%
And it's hard to live in
a world where you always

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.380 align:middle line:10%
have to look over your shoulder
to make sure that you're OK.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:35.324 align:middle line:90%


00:34:35.324 --> 00:34:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Ken, to tie
in with what we just saw,

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.989 align:middle line:84%
Orina from Safed,
Israel writes, why

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:43.510 align:middle line:84%
can't people of different
faiths get along?

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Why can't Christians
be Christians,

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Jews be Jews,
Muslims be Muslims.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.739 align:middle line:90%
Why so much fighting?

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Wouldn't it be
nice, especially among people

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.170 align:middle line:84%
who are monotheists, who
believe in a single God.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And as a professor, we
study this at length.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:05.410 align:middle line:84%
There is, sadly, one downside of
monotheism all through history.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And that, unfortunately, has
been intolerance of others.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Because if we have only
one god and if we believe

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.820 align:middle line:84%
that our way is the right
way and the only way,

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.190 align:middle line:90%
then your way must be wrong.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Judaism has tried
to cope with this,

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:24.380 align:middle line:84%
in fact, because at some
point in its history,

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.380 align:middle line:84%
it actually
declared, we will not

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.260 align:middle line:84%
attempt to convert
anybody anymore.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're
against conversion.

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:35.010 align:middle line:84%
If somebody wants to convert
to Judaism, our advice is, no,

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:35.880 align:middle line:90%
you don't.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that the
great sages and rabbis realized

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.550 align:middle line:84%
that if you're trying to
say, ours is the only way,

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.910 align:middle line:84%
it can unleash a can of worms
you don't want to get into.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.530 align:middle line:84%
But sadly, what have we
seen also in Christianity,

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.690 align:middle line:90%
in portions of Islam today?

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.680 align:middle line:10%
There was a Reformation
in Christianity--

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.190 align:middle line:10%
I think thankfully--
that brought

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:10%
about new attitudes instead of
the Inquisition and openness.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.590 align:middle line:10%
The Pope today and so
on are extending a hand

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.040 align:middle line:10%
to people of other faiths.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Islam-- there are many Muslims
in the world-- Dr. Zuhdi

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Jasser, I like to
mention his name, who

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:84%
is an American Muslim, a
leader who has wonderful things

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.490 align:middle line:84%
to say as a faithful,
observant Muslim.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there are forces at
work in the Islamic world,

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.051 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:36:26.051 --> 00:36:27.091 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look around you.

00:36:27.091 --> 00:36:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Exactly.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And Sisi, el-Sisi of
Egypt has bravely stood up

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and said, what we
need in Islam is

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.510 align:middle line:84%
a reformation like
there has been

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.600 align:middle line:90%
in other monotheistic faiths.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think just studying things
like the Dead Sea Scrolls--

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:84%
yes, as scholars,
but as lay people,

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.900 align:middle line:84%
as well-- we have
textual evidence.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.640 align:middle line:84%
We have a textual record
that we can sit around

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.550 align:middle line:84%
the table as people of
different faiths and say, now,

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.410 align:middle line:90%
here is what they wrote.

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:84%
We have texts going
back thousands of years.

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.000 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at them.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's sit down together
and reason it out.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.430 align:middle line:84%
What are they trying
to tell us today?

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
to do this, too.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:05.558 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: We have to do this.

00:37:05.558 --> 00:37:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because we'll destroy
each other if we don't.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Daryl from Pennsylvania
writes, do you

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.780 align:middle line:84%
think John the Baptist
was the Dead Sea Scrolls'

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Teacher of Righteousness?

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.170 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, I think-- and
this is very controversial.

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Scholars debate--
that John the Baptist

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:24.140 align:middle line:84%
may have been a member of
this sect at some point.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Some have, in fact,
tried to equate

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:30.400 align:middle line:84%
John the Baptist with the
famed Teacher of Righteousness.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And some others even
consider the Apostle Paul

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to be the so-called Wicked
Priest, also mentioned,

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:90%
or Jesus, maybe.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.550 align:middle line:84%
All different theories mentioned
in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:46.670 align:middle line:84%
The problem however, is
once again with the dating.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Most of these scrolls,
especially the early ones,

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.840 align:middle line:84%
when the Teacher of
Righteousness was around,

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:90%
date from second century BC.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:84%
That's a little bit too
early for John the Baptist.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.380 align:middle line:84%
But hey, we have to
have an open mind.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.770 align:middle line:90%
We have to say, here's the text.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you could find a
better argument, I'm open.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Daryl from West
Virginia-- this is interesting.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Did the Essene make contact
with alien life forms?

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.324 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:38:15.324 --> 00:38:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had to get that in.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Had to
get that in, right.

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And as an academic, this
is a touchy subject for me.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.960 align:middle line:84%
But I am increasingly
open to the idea

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.690 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient
writers were having

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.580 align:middle line:84%
some kind of experience
with some kind

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.820 align:middle line:90%
of interdimensional beings.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:39.450 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
ignore parallels between what

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:42.890 align:middle line:84%
they experienced and even
what modern UFO contactees

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:43.690 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.963 align:middle line:90%
Seems like the same thing.

00:38:44.963 --> 00:38:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And oftentimes,
both among the ancients

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and the moderns, what are the
messages that the aliens give?

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, divided--
sometimes, they're

00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:00.110 align:middle line:84%
messages of a bright, brilliant
future, sort of a millenarian

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:84%
hope for a future,
glorious Messianic Age.

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes and
oftentimes, they're

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:09.600 align:middle line:84%
messages of doom and cataclysm
right around the corner.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:12.850 align:middle line:90%
It exactly parallels antiquity.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line is we have
to be careful in saying

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:16.780 align:middle line:90%
this means this.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.900 align:middle line:90%
This means that.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I think we have
to be open-minded,

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.630 align:middle line:84%
just as John Allegro
was, in discussing

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:26.890 align:middle line:84%
were they consuming some kind of
hallucinogens that opened them

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:29.080 align:middle line:90%
to another dimension?

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Terence McKenna thinks
that the UFO phenomenon

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:37.500 align:middle line:84%
might be some kind of projection
from the consciousness

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.280 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth itself, Gaia, the
Gaia consciousness, projecting

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.670 align:middle line:84%
out of the Earth
itself, saying that we

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:48.110 align:middle line:84%
see the same kind of
beings, whether they're

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:51.000 align:middle line:84%
angels and demons or
sprites or fairies,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.360 align:middle line:84%
all through history, down to
the modern UFO phenomenon.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, is there a
warning in the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.910 align:middle line:90%
that we need to take heed?

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Many warnings.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the
world around us today,

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:84%
I think there is a danger
of militant fundamentalism

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:13.920 align:middle line:84%
that is rearing its head
and unleashing itself today.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.270 align:middle line:90%
We need to be more open.

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:16.980 align:middle line:90%
We need to be more ecumenical.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:20.325 align:middle line:84%
We need to learn from one
another's faith traditions

00:40:20.325 --> 00:40:21.125 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:40:21.125 --> 00:40:22.458 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But we're not learning.

00:40:22.458 --> 00:40:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: We're not.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's a huge lesson.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:31.750 align:middle line:84%
When we see sectarian
movements-- this is our land,

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.300 align:middle line:84%
it's not yours-- when we
look at Jerusalem today,

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and when we look at the
United Nations today,

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:middle line:84%
which even as we speak
is preparing seriously,

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.922 align:middle line:84%
with France at the lead, to
redraft the charter that formed

00:40:47.922 --> 00:40:49.380 align:middle line:84%
the state of Israel
to begin with--

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they want to
partition that off, don't they?

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.141 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: And partition it off.

00:40:52.141 --> 00:40:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And if I could come up with
a World War III scenario,

00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:59.562 align:middle line:90%
that would be it.

00:40:59.562 --> 00:41:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be it.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:01.135 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: That would be it.

00:41:01.135 --> 00:41:03.170 align:middle line:84%
When this is partitioned
off-- and Israel

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.200 align:middle line:84%
will be forced to
partition it-- this

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.480 align:middle line:90%
is a prescription for disaster.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.910 align:middle line:84%
When we look at what's
going on in Syria right now,

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.300 align:middle line:84%
my goodness-- the Golan
Heights for years and years

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.950 align:middle line:84%
were supposed to be delivered
by the Israelis back to Syria.

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if they had
actually done that.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And you'd have ISIS sitting
on the hills overlooking

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.892 align:middle line:90%
the Sea of Galilee.

00:41:24.892 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we have
the Palestinian.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They needed that
buffer zone, didn't they?

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.580 align:middle line:84%
We have the
Palestinian Authority,

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.470 align:middle line:84%
which, frankly,
is pretty corrupt,

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.120 align:middle line:84%
that is ruling in the
West Bank territories now.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And missiles
can now reach Israel

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.887 align:middle line:90%
from almost any spot.

00:41:37.887 --> 00:41:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Certainly.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about Iran
with actual words in Hebrew

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.540 align:middle line:84%
written on the missiles--
the state of Israel

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.100 align:middle line:90%
will be wiped off the map.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.150 align:middle line:84%
In Hebrew they're writing
this on the missiles

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:51.724 align:middle line:90%
that they're testing right now.

00:41:51.724 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:90%
This is serious stuff.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's lunacy.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: It's lunacy.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.420 align:middle line:10%
And I think on two levels--

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's Armageddon, Ken.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.170 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Well, yeah.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:41:59.820 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:00.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's what it is.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:01.410 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Sure.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:04.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And is there
any true hope for us?

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd love to leave
this program with something

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.900 align:middle line:84%
tremendously
positive, that mankind

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.140 align:middle line:84%
is going to fix this
problem and solve it.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.620 align:middle line:90%
But I can't say that.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.420 align:middle line:90%
Can you?

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: It's hart to.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:16.920 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that there are
a couple of things we can do.

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:24.780 align:middle line:84%
We can purpose ourselves
to be more metaphysical.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I think there is
something in the idea

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.140 align:middle line:90%
of a metaphysical drive--

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
think there's hope.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Yeah, I
do-- beyond ourselves

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.370 align:middle line:90%
that we can plug into.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:37.210 align:middle line:90%
The ancients did.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Even those who practice
yoga or who learn meditation

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:43.090 align:middle line:84%
are doing a little bit, I
think, to release something good

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:44.520 align:middle line:90%
into the atmosphere.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.570 align:middle line:84%
But then on a practical
level, I think

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:49.610 align:middle line:84%
we really can stand with
our allies in Israel

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and let our governments
know that we need to stand

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:90%
with Israel at this time.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We cannot
afford to make a mistake.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: We certainly cannot.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.510 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, there is hope.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.740 align:middle line:90%
There's two ways we can go.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
the ancients said.

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:06.250 align:middle line:84%
It's what modern
Orthodox rabbis say.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:11.330 align:middle line:84%
The Messiah will come either in
glory and wonder or on an ass.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's hope
it's glory and wonder.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:17.010 align:middle line:84%
My last question to you
is if you had a microphone

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:20.410 align:middle line:84%
to speak to the
planet, every person,

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:22.980 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell them?

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Listen.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.810 align:middle line:10%
Listen to the vibe.

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.180 align:middle line:10%
Open up.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.720 align:middle line:10%
Study.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.520 align:middle line:10%
Study.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:33.760 align:middle line:10%
You know, in Judaism, the
highest form of worship

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.915 align:middle line:10%
is study.

00:43:34.915 --> 00:43:37.112 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing
better you can do.

00:43:37.112 --> 00:43:38.320 align:middle line:90%
And there's so much to study.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.361 align:middle line:90%
There's so much to learn.

00:43:39.361 --> 00:43:41.390 align:middle line:90%
I've given my life to it.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:42.910 align:middle line:90%
And it opens us.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:45.060 align:middle line:84%
It's all part of
the same process,

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.830 align:middle line:84%
to open our minds to
the thinking of others,

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:50.410 align:middle line:84%
to learn to be more broad,
to be more ecumenical,

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:52.500 align:middle line:90%
and to do something good.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.670 align:middle line:84%
The rabbis were asked,
when will the Messiah come?

00:43:55.670 --> 00:44:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And they answer, when we make
the world ready to receive him.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:00.940 align:middle line:10%
It's on us.

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.185 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ken, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:03.185 --> 00:44:03.550 align:middle line:10%
Appreciate it.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:04.966 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: A real
pleasure, George.

00:44:04.966 --> 00:44:07.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We hold our
hand our own ability

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.270 align:middle line:10%
of our own destiny, our future.

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:13.520 align:middle line:10%
Let's hope that we
take the right path.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.690 align:middle line:90%
This has been "Beyond Belief."
