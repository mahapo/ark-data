>>GEORGE NOORY: If you're
a health fanatic like I am,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.900 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
love this program.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:10%
If you're not a health
fanatic, well, you're

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:10%
going to learn something.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory with our
special guest, Dr. Bradley

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Nelson, who is a world-renowned
specialist in the emerging

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
field of bioenergetic medicine
and energy psychology.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:84%
He's the author of a bestselling
book called "The Emotion Code."

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:84%
He's been on Gaia before,
and he's back with me now.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Bradley, welcome to the program.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADLEY NELSON:
Thank you, George.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:90%
in bioenergetic healing?

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Well--

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not something
you wake up in the morning

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and say, this is what I'm
going to do for a living.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: No, that's right.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.306 align:middle line:10%
Well, it really started
when I was seven years old.

00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:09.930 align:middle line:10%
I had a miraculous
thing that happened.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:10%
I was really sick
with the measles.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:10%
My father prayed for me
to be able to get well.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
The plan was I was going into
the hospital the next day,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:90%
and I was healed instantly.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you go from being
really, really sick one moment

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to being totally well
in the next instant,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.180 align:middle line:90%
you don't ever forget that.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And so that taught me that
there's a higher power.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:84%
There's some other power
that we can draw upon.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, so then fast
forward a number of years.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I ended up developing
kidney disease,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and there was nothing that
could be done for me medically.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
But I was healed through
some holistic doctors

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:90%
who worked with me.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.532 align:middle line:84%
And so that, again,
was another layer.

00:01:46.532 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, this
is what I want to do.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:84%
When I was 13 years
old, I decided

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be a healer
for the rest of my life.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to be
that kind of healer.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to heal
people naturally.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So then, time went
on, I got involved

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:84%
in computers and
computer programming

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and I was
about six months away

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:84%
from going into the MBA
program at the university

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:90%
that I was attending.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And I went home to Montana,
and my father, out of the blue,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.424 align:middle line:84%
said to me, are
you sure that you

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:14.417 align:middle line:84%
don't want to go into
the healing arts,

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:84%
because you've always
wanted to do it?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, I'm going
this other direction.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:90%
So that dream had kind of faded.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: So he said,
well, why don't you

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:90%
think about it one more time?

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And those were probably the
most important words anybody

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.677 align:middle line:90%
has ever spoken to me.

00:02:25.677 --> 00:02:27.093 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what dads are for.

00:02:27.093 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Exactly right.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And so my wife and I made up pro
and con lists, the healing arts

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
or the MBA and the
business world,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and I still didn't
know what to do.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So that night I got
on my knees, knowing

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that there was this higher power
we can draw upon, and I prayed.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, God, if you have
any idea about what I should do,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:90%
help me to know.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And that night I
had this experience

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.984 align:middle line:84%
where I was awakened
three different times.

00:02:49.984 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And each time that
I was awakened,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
my mind was full of
thoughts about how great it

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:84%
is to heal people
naturally and serve people.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day I
woke up and I thought, well,

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:90%
I still don't know.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.319 align:middle line:84%
And so the next night, I'm
on my knees again asking,

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and on that second night I had
the same experience three more

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
times, except this time each
experience was geometrically

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
more powerful, like,
logarithmically more

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.959 align:middle line:90%
powerfully, if you can imagine.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So then on the second
night, the third time

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.477 align:middle line:84%
I had this experience, the
thoughts of service to mankind

00:03:20.477 --> 00:03:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and the whole planet,
the whole world,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
was just absolutely
overwhelming.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And I heard a voice
that spoke to me.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.859 align:middle line:84%
And the voice said, this
is a sacred calling.

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
that's the answer.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.176 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
that meant, really.

00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But I believe now that any
time we're working on someone,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
any time you're
working on the body--

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:84%
because the body, I believe,
literally is a temple,

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and I had an experience
once that showed me that.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we're healing people,
helping people in any way

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:84%
naturally, we're
doing something that's

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:84%
sacred because our
existence is sacred.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:90%
So that was it.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:90%
I went to chiropractic school.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.910 align:middle line:84%
When I got out, I figured,
well, that higher power

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:90%
has gotten me into this.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that higher
power will help me.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And so with each person that
I saw over many, many years,

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:84%
before I'd work on someone,
I would just take a moment

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:84%
and offer this silent
prayer for help.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And there were times,
George, during those years,

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:84%
where somebody would
come in to see me

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know how to
deal with their problem,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to approach
what they had going on,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and I would offer
that silent prayer.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.391 align:middle line:84%
And this was a totally private,
totally personal thing.

00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:32.101 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever knew I
was asking for help.

00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not even the patient?

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: No, no, no, no.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever knew.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.055 align:middle line:84%
It was a totally
personal thing, and it

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:38.630 align:middle line:84%
was just a momentary
thing, really,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.370 align:middle line:84%
just trying to connect
and ask for help.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:84%
There were times, though,
when the information I needed

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:84%
would just literally
flood into my being

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
like a data dump from
above of what to do

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and how to approach this and
how to conceptualize this

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and how to look at this,
and it was often in ways

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.680 align:middle line:84%
that I'd never even imagined and
that nobody else had, really,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.920 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.987 align:middle line:90%
And so it was an amazing thing.

00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
biggest things that I

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
learned was that
all of my patients,

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.370 align:middle line:84%
no matter what they
were suffering from,

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
no matter how old or young they
were, no matter whether they

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.610 align:middle line:84%
were dealing with depression
or anxiety or phobias or panic

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:84%
attacks or physical problems
or cancer or infertility,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was, they were
all suffering from something

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:84%
that I came to call
emotional baggage.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
eventually got this message

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.097 align:middle line:84%
to write this book, "The Emotion
Code," because I found that--

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great book, by the way.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah, thank you.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great book.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for having
me on all those years ago--

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --right after
it first came out.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that was--

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That helped
zoom it, I hope.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: It did, yeah.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Doctor, it's amazing
how you're able to tap

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
into this so-called
source for healing.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Right.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all have
that capability.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just most-- the
problem is, I think,

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that most people don't realize
that they have the ability

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.820 align:middle line:90%
to ask and get help.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:90%
But we do.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:84%
We can ask, and we can get help,
and I know that that's true,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.627 align:middle line:84%
and I know that that
higher power is real

00:06:08.627 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and is aware of what's
going on in our lives

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.890 align:middle line:84%
all the time because I had those
experiences in my practice.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:90%
So it was a remarkable thing.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, eventually I got the
feeling and the message

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to write a
book about the Emotion Code

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and get it out
there to everybody.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I left my
practice in 2004.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:90%
The book came out in 2007.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It's coming out in hardcover
in the spring of 2019.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And about a year after "The
Emotion Code" came out,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I had this experience where
I was awakened one morning

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
to find my mind
full of instruction,

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and the instruction
was really specific.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And the instruction
was, you need

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
to take everything that you've
learned about natural healing

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and put it into a
self-study course

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that anyone can learn and
make it available to everyone,

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.150 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:07.775 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what the next
level of this for me was,

00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:10.625 align:middle line:84%
was creating what we
call the Body Code.

00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:90%
And the Body Code is just that.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.125 align:middle line:90%
It's a self-study course.

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:84%
We believe it's the most
advanced self-study course

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.120 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a
patented software

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:84%
that enables people to basically
open the subconscious mind

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and ask the subconscious
what is really going on

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:84%
because the conscious
mind is where we live,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and our conscious minds
really aren't that smart.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:90%
We like to think we're smart.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.937 align:middle line:84%
But we don't remember what
happened yesterday, we

00:07:35.937 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:84%
don't remember what we had
for breakfast last Wednesday,

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and we forget all kinds of
things and get in trouble.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The mind has a
way of cleaning things out

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:90%
of your brain, doesn't it?

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a computer
cleaning out your system.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: It is.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
It's continually cleaning, and
sometimes things that we'd like

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:90%
to remember, we don't.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But the subconscious
mind is the part of us

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that is this vast, vast
computer, this holographic--

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It
remembers everything.

00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: It remembers
everything, everything

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:84%
you've ever done,
every face you've ever

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.600 align:middle line:84%
seen in a crowd, everything
you've ever eaten or tasted

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.516 align:middle line:90%
or touched or smelled.

00:08:06.516 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
It's all in there in this
holographic computer.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And it also knows exactly what
needs to be done for a person

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
to get well and manifest total
perfect abundance in health

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.840 align:middle line:90%
and love and everything else.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it was during
those years in my practice

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.060 align:middle line:84%
that I was trying to
figure out what was

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:90%
really wrong with my patients.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I was really obsessed, frankly,
at getting to the underlying

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:90%
causes.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.280 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
Band-Aid people.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to really
figure out why they

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.361 align:middle line:90%
were having these problems.

00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And so what I learned
was there are really

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.961 align:middle line:84%
six underlying imbalances,
six categories of imbalances.

00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll go through those
imbalances in a moment, too,

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:90%
and you can point them out.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.300 align:middle line:84%
But are you saying that
people can heal themselves?

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: People can heal
themselves to a great degree,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's really what's
driving this global success

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:84%
of the Emotion Code,
and the Body Code

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
as well, that people are
learning that they each have

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.690 align:middle line:84%
this ability, this
birthright, I like

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:90%
to call it, to be a healer.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazingly
empowering for people

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:84%
to learn that they have this
ability built right in them.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that everybody on
the planet, every man, woman,

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.040 align:middle line:90%
and child has this ability.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.777 align:middle line:84%
It's latent in just
about everybody.

00:09:24.777 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just
have to pull it out.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Exactly.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Larry
Dossey, in one

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:84%
of his books called
"Healing Words," talked

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
about the power of
prayer in healing.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: So exactly
how does this work?

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:10%
How does the power of prayer
affect lowering blood pressure,

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:10%
speeding up recovery
times after surgery,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.240 align:middle line:10%
lowering the incidence
of heart attacks?

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.407 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:09:49.407 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY DOSSEY: There
are several mechanisms

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:90%
that have been proposed.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:84%
One is just a simple
relaxation and feeling calm.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.750 align:middle line:84%
People who enter into a
state of prayer or meditation

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.990 align:middle line:84%
have long been known to have
good physiological responses

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:90%
The blood pressure goes down.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Respirations tend to diminish.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Oxygen demand goes down.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:90%
Heart rate tends to fall.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So these are some of
the things that we've

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.320 align:middle line:84%
known for a long time
about how prayer benefits

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:90%
the person who's praying.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting
question comes

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.530 align:middle line:84%
when you inquire about
how prayer might affect

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.775 align:middle line:90%
somebody else at a distance.

00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's
what it does to you.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yes.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.010 align:middle line:10%
And so there are many theories
about how this sort of thing

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:10%
can work.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:10%
I think it's only fair to say
that no one knows, currently,

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:10%
what the explanation
will turn out to be.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:47.280 align:middle line:84%
The going popular notions is
that people are entangled.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a concept that comes
from quantum mechanics.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And even though things seem
to be divided and separate

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and far apart, quantum
physics gives us

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:84%
a way of understanding
how things

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:84%
can be separate
and at a distance,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.765 align:middle line:84%
yet behave as if
they are united.

00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:07.917 align:middle line:84%
The pop word is
"entanglement" in physics.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Let me add, though,
that whether or not this

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.960 align:middle line:84%
is going to prove to be
the explanation for prayer

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:90%
is really up in the air.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Nelson, when we
pray, what are we tapping into?

00:11:18.659 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: We're tapping
into the power that

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.330 align:middle line:84%
created the universe,
the power that

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
holds all the planets
in their orbits,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.940 align:middle line:84%
the power that is giving
life to everything,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:84%
the power that's in everything
and through everything.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And so to go through our
lives without tapping

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.660 align:middle line:84%
into that power, I
think, is a real shame

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:47.237 align:middle line:84%
because we can tap into that
power and we can get answers

00:11:47.237 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:90%
and we can get help.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And I know that that's
actually how it is.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find
that some negative people

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.900 align:middle line:84%
are more sickly than people
who are positive and upbeat?

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Well, absolutely.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- and of course,
what the Emotion Code is

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:84%
about is about how the emotional
experiences that we go through

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.600 align:middle line:84%
can stay with us in the
form of emotional baggage

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.887 align:middle line:84%
or, in other words, energies,
negative emotional energies

00:12:14.887 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:90%
that become trapped in the body.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And the more of those we
have, the more difficult

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.166 align:middle line:84%
it is for us to feel
positive and to really

00:12:22.166 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:84%
manifest what we're supposed
to be able to manifest

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.460 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you release enough
of your emotional baggage,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like stepping
out of this old skin

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that you've been walking
around in all your life

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and stepping out into
this new state of being

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.630 align:middle line:84%
that's much closer to what
you are really supposed to be

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and how you're supposed
to be in this world.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if we're
not tapping into a source,

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.300 align:middle line:84%
but it's our own personal
abilities to do this?

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.779 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:56.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I think
that it is, yes.

00:12:56.195 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that the power of
our own subconscious mind

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
is beyond our ability
to really comprehend.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think about it,
they say the average cell is

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:13.995 align:middle line:84%
equivalent in complexity to a
full-size aircraft carrier--

00:13:13.995 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Navy, so I know
what you're talking about.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --with 10,000 people
working onboard and jets with

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.650 align:middle line:84%
their engines pulled up on
the ramp, ready to take off,

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.902 align:middle line:84%
and people working on electric
countermeasures and all kinds

00:13:24.902 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Planes
coming up and down.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Absolutely.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:84%
One cell is like
that, that complex.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're an adult, you have
about 137 trillion cells

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.460 align:middle line:90%
like that in your body.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And what's running all of that?

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.210 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that--

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:84%
my own belief is that it is
your own subconscious mind that

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.170 align:middle line:90%
is running all of that.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's being
assisted and helped

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:84%
by this energy that
fills the universe.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we can do a
lot with our own subconscious

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:90%
power.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But I've come to believe
that, as far as healing goes,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
that the highest
duty of the healer

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.710 align:middle line:84%
is to act as a go-between
for that higher power.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's easy to do.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.990 align:middle line:84%
If you just take just a
moment and ask for that help,

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:90%
it's immediately there.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are some people
able to do this and other

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.821 align:middle line:90%
people can't?

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, I
think it has a lot

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
to do with their own
experiences and the amount

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.640 align:middle line:84%
of emotional baggage
that they have.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And bring with them.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.943 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And what they
brought with them and what

00:14:32.943 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:84%
they've inherited from their
own ancestors, as well--

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and that's one of the
things in the Emotion Code

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.110 align:middle line:84%
that's really
beautiful, that we can

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.072 align:middle line:84%
find inherited emotional
baggage and release that.

00:14:43.072 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the time,
that's interfering

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:84%
with our ability to really
create the life that we want.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.200 align:middle line:84%
The way I look at
it is this, George.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.900 align:middle line:84%
We have this-- we are beings
that are capable of perfection.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:84%
In this life,
though, what happens

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
is we end up with a lot of these
little dark clouds within us,

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and those are from the
experiences that we've

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.540 align:middle line:84%
been through, our divorce,
our abuse as a child,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
difficult work
situations, and the things

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:90%
that we've inherited.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And so as we start to get rid
of those things, what happens

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is the light beings that we
are begins to be able to shine

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.250 align:middle line:90%
more and more brightly.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And as that's
happening, we change.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.360 align:middle line:90%
It changes how we feel.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.080 align:middle line:84%
We become more capable
of giving and receiving

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.060 align:middle line:90%
unconditional love.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:90%
We become clearer.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:39.389 align:middle line:84%
We become more able to really
manifest into the world

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:41.180 align:middle line:84%
what we're supposed to
be able to manifest.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.846 align:middle line:84%
I believe that everybody
has a blueprint

00:15:42.846 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
within their heart
of the perfect life

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that they can live, and
the vast majority of people

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.875 align:middle line:90%
don't ever come close to that.

00:15:48.875 --> 00:15:50.480 align:middle line:84%
But by getting
rid of the baggage

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:84%
that we have, by
healing these bodies,

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.826 align:middle line:84%
and not only by getting
rid of emotional baggage,

00:15:55.826 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:84%
but also by getting
rid of things

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
that shouldn't be in our bodies,
like pathogens and chemical

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:90%
toxins and dental toxins--

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.322 align:middle line:84%
and all of this
kind of stuff needs

00:16:05.322 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:90%
to be gotten out of the body.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:84%
The more we do that,
the more we come

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:84%
back to who we're
supposed to be,

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's where we
start to really vibrate

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:15.891 align:middle line:90%
at a level of joy.

00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
dental toxins could

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.225 align:middle line:90%
be the worst of all of them.

00:16:19.225 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Can't they?

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.007 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, they
certainly are right up there.

00:16:23.007 --> 00:16:23.840 align:middle line:90%
They definitely can.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.946 align:middle line:84%
I mean, mercury, which is
in all the amalgam fillings

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that people still
have walking around--

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had all mine
taken out by the way.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, me too, yeah.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just ceramic.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: The only thing more
toxic, I guess, than mercury

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:37.797 align:middle line:90%
is plutonium.

00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:39.380 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't put
that into your teeth.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not at all.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.210 align:middle line:84%
In your book "The
Emotion Code," you

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.700 align:middle line:84%
talk about, as you mentioned,
the six imbalances.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, the
six imbalances--

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.580 align:middle line:84%
what this has to do with
is really the foundation

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.614 align:middle line:90%
of the Body Code.

00:16:53.614 --> 00:16:55.530 align:middle line:84%
During all those years
that I was in practice,

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.988 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
figure out what was

00:16:56.988 --> 00:16:59.182 align:middle line:84%
really wrong with my
patients, of course.

00:16:59.182 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was that they
all had something in common,

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and that was they
were all suffering

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:84%
from these different
kinds of imbalances.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
categorize those

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:90%
into six different categories.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And so these imbalances
are things like pathogens.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, these
are little infections

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.849 align:middle line:84%
that get into the body--
viruses, bacteria,

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:19.161 align:middle line:84%
fungal infections,
mold, parasites.

00:17:19.161 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:84%
If those are in your body, if
any of those are in your body

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're living in your body,
you need to get rid of them

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:90%
to be totally healthy.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Another kind of imbalance is
a structural misalignment.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And I found as a
chiropractor, of course,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that realigning bones and things
made tremendous differences

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:84%
As time went on, though, I found
that any tissue can misalign.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
misaligned bone or tissue,

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
there's almost always
an underlying reason

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that is below that that's
actually causing that.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people
sometimes will get realigned

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and they'll-- and
this happened to me.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I had patients
that would come in

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and I would realign
their spine, and they'd

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
come back the next week and it
would all be out of alignment

00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And that started me
really wondering--

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --what's
the mechanism here?

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: What's
really going on?

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's happening
to these people?

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And so that's another kind
of imbalance-- misalignment.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Any tissue that's misaligned
will cause trouble.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Another area is
nutritional and lifestyle.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So obviously if you're not
getting the right chemicals,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:90%
nutrients in the body--

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.586 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that might
be the easiest to fix.

00:18:20.586 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Oftentimes it is.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that people have
the most awareness about this.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I
was a kid growing up,

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:84%
my mom was considered
a health nut,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and people actually
thought she was a nut.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And people did think she
was crazy because vitamins,

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:34.730 align:middle line:90%
nobody needs those.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Now we all know we need those.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But different foods
and things like

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:84%
that, you've got
to make sure you're

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.500 align:middle line:90%
getting enough of those things.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And then another kind of
imbalance is toxicity.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:84%
If you have toxins
in the body, you

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:84%
need to move those out of the
body to be totally healthy.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Another kind of imbalance
has to do with the circuits

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:90%
in the systems of the body.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:84%
The body is very
highly organized.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.990 align:middle line:84%
There are acupuncture
circuits and systems,

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.726 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the
respiratory system

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and the digestive
system, and all

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:84%
those need to be
functioning right.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.790 align:middle line:84%
But another thing that we
found that's in the Body Code

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:84%
is the connection between the
spirit and the physical body.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
What I believe is
that within us, we

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.269 align:middle line:84%
have this spirit that
looks just like us.

00:19:19.269 --> 00:19:20.810 align:middle line:84%
If you could take
it out of your body

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.351 align:middle line:84%
and put it right
next to you, I think

00:19:22.351 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:90%
it would look exactly like you.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And I always used
to wonder, what's

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.594 align:middle line:90%
the interface between these two?

00:19:27.594 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when somebody dies
and you go to the funeral

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.968 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the person
lying there in the casket,

00:19:31.968 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:84%
obviously there's
something that's different.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.016 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And at the
moment of death, we

00:19:36.016 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:90%
lose a certain amount of weight.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe
that's that spirit.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And of course--

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the soul, right?

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.949 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: It's the soul, yeah.

00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Initially they called
it the chi or the qi,

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.415 align:middle line:84%
I think, or the prana, depending
on where you were in the world.

00:19:48.415 --> 00:19:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But that part of us--
you see, when we're alive

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and we're living in
our physical body,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.441 align:middle line:84%
those two need to
somehow connect.

00:19:57.441 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And I used to wonder about
this and ponder about this.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And we still don't
know how they connect,

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:90%
but they do on a profound level.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And what we have found
is that sometimes things

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.220 align:middle line:90%
can break down there.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.306 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things that is also

00:20:11.306 --> 00:20:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that we include
in the Body Code,

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:84%
that you can find those kinds
of disconnections and fix those.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, let me tell you
a story that really is

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:90%
what got this started for me.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:84%
My wife was really
sick with our youngest

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:90%
daughter who just moved out.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.205 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I, now, are empty
nesters for the first time.

00:20:28.205 --> 00:20:29.884 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
interesting so far.

00:20:29.884 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's strange.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.600 align:middle line:90%
It's strange.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:90%
I went through that too.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.179 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yeah,
it's strange so far.

00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:36.390 align:middle line:90%
But we're having a good time.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But when my wife was pregnant
with her 19 or so years ago,

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.560 align:middle line:84%
she was really sick
with morning sickness.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.852 align:middle line:84%
And she was begging
me to help her.

00:20:44.852 --> 00:20:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
about the things

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that we usually do to help
morning sickness, which

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:84%
don't really work all that
well, like the wrist bands

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:90%
and eating ginger and so on.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So I offered a silent
prayer about this.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, God, there's got to be
a better way to look at this

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.140 align:middle line:90%
and help this problem.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:10%
And I suddenly had
this information

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:08.130 align:middle line:10%
that flowed into
me, and it basically

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:10%
had to do with the
connection between the mother

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:17.144 align:middle line:10%
and the fetus, that if that
connection is not fully there--

00:21:17.144 --> 00:21:18.560 align:middle line:10%
and it's an energetic
connection--

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.790 align:middle line:10%
if that connection
is not fully there,

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.120 align:middle line:10%
then morning sickness
is the result.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK, well,
let's try this out.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So I worked on my
wife, and I was

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:90%
able to make the reconnections.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, instantly, the
morning sickness was gone.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:21:33.395 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And so I thought,
this is really amazing.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:90%
And every woman that I've--

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she felt great?

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Oh yeah,
she felt great.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:84%
A couple of days later, it kind
of started to come back again,

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and I rechecked her, and
another little connection

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:90%
needed to be made.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:84%
But we have practitioners
now who just practice,

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and this is their focus
and their specialty

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:84%
is fixing nausea or fixing
morning sickness just

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:90%
by making these reconnections.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:00.844 align:middle line:90%
So it's really an amazing thing.

00:22:00.844 --> 00:22:01.759 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:22:01.759 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The last
imbalance is called

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:90%
trapped emotions, isn't it?

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, the last
imbalance, really, we

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:84%
call energies, but it
includes trapped emotions,

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.625 align:middle line:84%
and it includes other
things, as well.

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:15.738 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: OK.

00:22:15.738 --> 00:22:18.208 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:33.050 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:84%
I believe, without
question, the single biggest

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:84%
underlying common
denominator for all of us,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:84%
with all the illnesses that we
suffer from, whether they're

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:84%
physical ailments such as
chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.140 align:middle line:84%
or asthma or infertility
or the aches and pains

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that we suffer from or the
depression, the anxiety,

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:84%
the panic attacks, the
phobias, the self-sabotage

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that so many of us
deal with, is actually

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.270 align:middle line:90%
what I call emotional baggage.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the trapped
emotional energies

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:84%
that are still with us
from those emotional events

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:84%
that we have passed through in
our lives, from our divorce,

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.840 align:middle line:84%
from our abuse as a child,
from our difficult work.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Those energy stay with
us and disrupt our lives

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and cause our diseases and
much of our self-sabotage.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.850 align:middle line:84%
It's really true that as we
start to release emotions,

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:84%
it is like peeling off
the layers of an onion.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Some of those may have occurred
when they were a child.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Some of those may have
happened during their divorce

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:84%
or during their working years or
during college or high school.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And eventually we are
able to get to a point

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:84%
where we no longer have
those trapped emotions, where

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:90%
the body is clear of those.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, it's like
stepping out of the old skin

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that we've been carrying
all these years,

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and we step out of
that and we become

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.892 align:middle line:84%
this person that we were really
intended to be in this world.

00:23:51.892 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
is about, and that's

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.250 align:middle line:90%
why this is so powerful.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That clip was from the
Gaia documentary "E-motion."

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.036 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean, though, Brad?

00:24:01.036 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, we all
have emotional baggage,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:84%
whether we remember
everything that's

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:11.390 align:middle line:84%
gone on in our lives that was
emotionally powerful or not.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And like I mentioned before,
some of the emotional baggage

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
that we're dragging
through our lives

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:84%
is from the lives
of our ancestors.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That far back?

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'll share
a story with you.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.820 align:middle line:84%
My daughter was
working on me one day.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And the Emotion Code can
be done at a distance.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:90%
And we have almost--

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.380 align:middle line:84%
we'll soon have
5,000 practitioners

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.394 align:middle line:84%
around the world in about 74
countries so far that are--

00:24:36.394 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --certified
in the Emotion Code.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You train them?

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yep.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they do the
Emotion Code, and they

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:84%
have clients in other
countries and so on because it

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:90%
can be done at a distance.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And it is all about entanglement
and quantum physics.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's the practical
application of that knowledge,

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:51.275 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:24:51.275 --> 00:24:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So I asked my daughter
to work on me one day.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And she was in Seattle,
and I was in Southern Utah

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:90%
where I work--

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she does
this, then, obviously?

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah, she does this.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And so this was a
number of years ago,

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.416 align:middle line:84%
two years after "The
Emotion Code" came out.

00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:90%
So she's working on me.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And right away she
finds that I have

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:84%
an inherited trapped
emotion of hopelessness.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And I had gotten it, she
finds through testing,

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:90%
from my father.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:90%
He got it from his mother.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:90%
She got it from her mother.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.080 align:middle line:90%
She got it from her mother.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.205 align:middle line:90%
She got it from her mother.

00:25:20.205 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back 22
generations from me.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yep-- to a
grandmother of ours

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that probably lived in
Ireland somewhere late 1400s.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And when my daughter arrived
at this conclusion, all

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.870 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden she could feel
the presence of this woman,

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:90%
this grandmother.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.360 align:middle line:84%
She could feel her
standing right next to her.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.690 align:middle line:90%
And she could feel her emotions.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.030 align:middle line:84%
She could feel how
desperate she was

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:84%
to have this emotional energy
released from her posterity,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
and she could also feel how
overwhelmed with gratitude

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.504 align:middle line:84%
this woman was that
this was being done.

00:25:56.504 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So my daughter
released that energy.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, she, my daughter,
had received it from me

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.460 align:middle line:90%
at conception.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And science is now bearing
this out that animals--

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
so far they're finding
that animals transfer

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.470 align:middle line:90%
energetic memories somehow.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:90%
They still don't know how.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's what we call
inherited trapped emotions.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, for me, it was one
of most powerful healings

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I have ever had because
all my life, George,

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I struggled with this background
feeling of hopelessness.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.056 align:middle line:10%
In fact, during--

00:26:27.056 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And did you
know you had this?

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.804 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: No, I just knew
that I struggled with it.

00:26:30.804 --> 00:26:32.612 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that
I had this emotion.

00:26:32.612 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I thought I
had been cleared out

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:84%
of all my emotional
baggage years before.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.633 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: But sometimes
things show up

00:26:38.633 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:90%
when they're supposed to.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.780 align:middle line:10%
And if you would have
asked me during the time,

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.120 align:middle line:10%
during the year or two that
I was writing "The Emotion

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:10%
Code," if you would have asked
me to describe it in one word

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:10%
how the project felt, I
would, without hesitation,

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.690 align:middle line:10%
have used that word.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.814 align:middle line:90%
I would have said hopeless.

00:26:52.814 --> 00:26:54.009 align:middle line:90%
It feels hopeless.

00:26:54.009 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And when she cleared
that emotion from me--

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every time
I go to write,

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.020 align:middle line:84%
every day, I would have
to listen for half an hour

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:84%
to an hour to really
positive motivational things

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.630 align:middle line:84%
to get pumped up to
be able to write,

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.640 align:middle line:90%
to overcome this hopelessness.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly it was like
the factory shut off.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:90%
The silence was deafening.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't feel
that energy anymore.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And I never knew.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:84%
It was always there in a
background way in my life

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.190 align:middle line:90%
until that was done.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.010 align:middle line:90%
It changed my life, actually.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:90%
And it changed hers, as well.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:25.880 align:middle line:90%
She was an artist, see.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:90%
She is an artist.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.550 align:middle line:84%
But she had never
painted anything

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.840 align:middle line:84%
until that energy was removed,
that hopeless energy from all

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:84%
those generations ago, 22
generations, hundreds of years

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.710 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And within a year, she had
an art showing in Seattle,

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and all this art was
just pouring out of her.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.005 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you think
about your own life--

00:27:46.005 --> 00:27:47.130 align:middle line:90%
think about your ancestors.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:90%
What did they go through?

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.169 align:middle line:84%
All of our ancestors went
through traumatic things

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:90%
at some point or another.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And the subconscious
mind of that individual, then,

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.200 align:middle line:84%
often will feel, OK,
this is important,

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
what happened to me just now
with the pogrom or with the war

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.950 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I need to share this
energy, this emotion,

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.480 align:middle line:84%
because it could save the life
of someone in my posterity.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.090 align:middle line:90%
It's all unconscious, right?

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.140 align:middle line:90%
But that's what happens.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:90%
That energy, then, is shared.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.205 align:middle line:90%
And it's really one energy.

00:28:14.205 --> 00:28:15.330 align:middle line:90%
But that's quantum physics.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:84%
One energy can be in an
infinite number of places.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So when it's released
from the living person,

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.870 align:middle line:84%
it releases from all of that
posterity all the way back.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:26.890 align:middle line:84%
This is what we
find on the testing.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite an amazing thing.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.460 align:middle line:84%
It's making-- when we
release an inherited emotion,

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.650 align:middle line:84%
it helps not only the
living human being,

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.760 align:middle line:84%
but there's this big
ripple effect that happens.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you what
I've come to believe.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this Earth,
of course, as you well know,

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.377 align:middle line:84%
is in this
transformational process.

00:28:46.377 --> 00:28:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Constantly.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to
get to this new world.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
it can't happen

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
without those that have
already lived on this world,

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.056 align:middle line:90%
They're all still around.

00:29:00.056 --> 00:29:00.930 align:middle line:90%
They're still around.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:90%
They're still here.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.377 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to transform
with the living and those

00:29:05.377 --> 00:29:06.210 align:middle line:90%
that have passed on.

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is just a little
way to help them, too.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.430 align:middle line:84%
At least this is what
we find on the testing.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Nelson,
you have talked

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:15.330 align:middle line:84%
about how important
the subconscious

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.660 align:middle line:90%
mind is for healing, as well.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.950 align:middle line:90%
How do you tap into that?

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's subconscious,
you're really not aware of it,

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.111 align:middle line:90%
but it's there.

00:29:24.111 --> 00:29:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Right.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:25.900 align:middle line:90%
That's really the key.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
future of all healing

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.380 align:middle line:84%
is going to be just that,
tapping into that subconscious

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.650 align:middle line:84%
mind that is wholly aware
with a perfect understanding

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:38.100 align:middle line:84%
of everything that needs to be
done to help the individual be

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.640 align:middle line:84%
well and get healthy and
so on and live the longest

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.030 align:middle line:90%
life possible.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So we use different methods
of doing that, of tapping

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.854 align:middle line:90%
into the subconscious mind.

00:29:46.854 --> 00:29:48.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the simplest
methods that I

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.650 align:middle line:84%
can share with
the audience right

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:84%
now is what we
call the sway test.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, a plant will grow towards
light coming in from a window.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.420 align:middle line:84%
A plant will grow away from
harsh negative sounds coming

00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.220 align:middle line:90%
out of a speaker.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.250 align:middle line:90%
They've proven that.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And the human body will
respond in the same way.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, if
you're holding thoughts

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:10.080 align:middle line:84%
of truth or positivity or
congruency and you're standing

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and you're very relaxed,
your subconscious mind

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:84%
will tend to move your
physical body forward.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.420 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to lean forward
towards those thoughts

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.090 align:middle line:84%
because they're perceived
as being in front of you

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.680 align:middle line:84%
because we're always
used to dealing

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.440 align:middle line:84%
with the world in front of
us, the work at our desk

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.740 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.990 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
the subconscious mind

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.042 align:middle line:84%
will tend to make
you sway backwards

00:30:32.042 --> 00:30:34.250 align:middle line:84%
if you're holding thoughts
of negativity or falsehood

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.840 align:middle line:90%
or incongruity.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.260 align:middle line:90%
So you can try this at home.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.140 align:middle line:84%
You can try thinking of
something negative, like war,

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and as you're holding that
thought, if you're standing

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
very relaxed, what will
happen is as you focus

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.870 align:middle line:84%
on that thought or any
negative thought that you want,

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.510 align:middle line:84%
any negative emotion that
you want, what will happen

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:84%
is you'll start
to sway backwards.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if you're
holding thoughts of love,

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:02.330 align:middle line:84%
unconditional love, gratitude,
thinking about maybe a person

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that you're overwhelmed
with gratitude for, maybe

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.654 align:middle line:84%
a parent or a loved
one, what will happen

00:31:07.654 --> 00:31:09.320 align:middle line:84%
is your body will
start to sway forward.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.089 align:middle line:90%
And you can try this at home.

00:31:12.089 --> 00:31:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But this is one of the ways you
can tap into the subconscious

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:19.340 align:middle line:84%
mind is you can ask questions
or make statements-- do I have

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.700 align:middle line:90%
a trapped emotion, for example.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And as you hold that
thought in your mind,

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:84%
as you're standing
there totally relaxed,

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.685 align:middle line:84%
your body will sway forward
for yes or back for no.

00:31:29.685 --> 00:31:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Now, we can
also use other methods.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.910 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of
self-testing methods

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.320 align:middle line:84%
that we teach in the Emotion
Code and the Body Code.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.980 align:middle line:84%
There's this one that we
call the ring in ring method

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:84%
where your body, you see,
will be slightly stronger when

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:47.680 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious mind is
radiating a yes answer.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the rings will
tend to stay together

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:90%
if you pull them apart.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.596 align:middle line:84%
If you say something
and the answer is no

00:31:55.596 --> 00:31:57.595 align:middle line:84%
or you're thinking of
something that's not true,

00:31:57.595 --> 00:32:00.360 align:middle line:84%
what will happen is your
body will be slightly weaker.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the rings will
tend to break apart, see.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
one-handed methods.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:84%
There's the flick
method, like this.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.170 align:middle line:84%
You can test, what we call
this one, the elbow test.

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.450 align:middle line:90%
You can press down for yes.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle line:84%
It will be strong on yes and
it will go weaker on no--

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.550 align:middle line:90%
lots of different methods.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:21.884 align:middle line:84%
Testing other people-- one
person can hold out their arm

00:32:21.884 --> 00:32:23.383 align:middle line:84%
and you can press
down on their arm.

00:32:23.383 --> 00:32:25.115 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you've
seen that many times.

00:32:25.115 --> 00:32:27.500 align:middle line:84%
If they say their name is
their name, they'll be strong.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.180 align:middle line:84%
If they say their name is
somebody else's, then they'll

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:90%
be weak.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But this is how we tap in
to the subconscious mind.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And the Body Code, starting with
the Emotion Code, of course,

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that's how we can find inherited
emotions that otherwise you'd

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.970 align:middle line:90%
never know about.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.540 align:middle line:84%
That's how we can find,
really, any kind of imbalance

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.540 align:middle line:84%
that might be going
on in the body.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's really how
the Body Code works.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.314 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing
thing about it is

00:32:53.314 --> 00:32:54.980 align:middle line:84%
you can find things
that otherwise you'd

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:90%
never, ever be able to find.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you a story.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.068 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman that
came in to see me.

00:32:59.068 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:84%
She'd been hospitalized for five
days with this terrific pain

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:03.470 align:middle line:90%
in her abdomen.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.670 align:middle line:90%
And there I am.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is not good.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Not good
at all, right?

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.321 align:middle line:84%
And it was really severe,
and they ran every test

00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:11.630 align:middle line:84%
that they could, kept
her there for a week.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And they finally
decided, you know what,

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.850 align:middle line:90%
all these tests are negative.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we think
maybe it's all in your head

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to release you.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.850 align:middle line:90%
She still had the pain.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And so she came in to see
me a couple of days later,

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.060 align:middle line:90%
and she's really in pain.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.184 align:middle line:90%
And I did some testing.

00:33:28.184 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that I found

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.220 align:middle line:84%
that I thought was incidental
was that she needed chromium.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have any at
my office at the time.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:36.710 align:middle line:90%
We were out of it.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I think
you need this,

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.160 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't think much of it.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So the next day she
came into my office--

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't know
how much she needed, right?

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I didn't know
how much she needed.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.780 align:middle line:90%
No, I had no idea.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.070 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was incidental.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:50.270 align:middle line:84%
The next day she comes in
and she's really in pain.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking, this woman,

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:57.460 align:middle line:84%
they must have missed something
really major in the hospital.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:90%
She's in so much pain.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something going on.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.326 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I didn't
know what else to do.

00:34:01.326 --> 00:34:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So I used the Body
Code and started

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:84%
figuring out what
her subconscious

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:90%
mind was trying to say.

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And out of all 867
nodes in the Body Code,

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.010 align:middle line:84%
it took me right to
the nutritional node.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And out of all the nutritional
elements on that chart,

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.239 align:middle line:90%
it went right to chromium.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.460 align:middle line:90%
And then I remembered.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.567 align:middle line:90%
So this showed up yesterday.

00:34:23.567 --> 00:34:24.366 align:middle line:90%
So you know what?

00:34:24.366 --> 00:34:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I think your body
really needs this.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.497 align:middle line:90%
I want you to leave right now.

00:34:27.497 --> 00:34:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Go down the street to
the health food store.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.382 align:middle line:90%
Buy some chromium.

00:34:30.382 --> 00:34:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Start popping.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Have them
give you some water.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Open it up.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.219 align:middle line:90%
Take some right there.

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.820 align:middle line:90%
George, 20 minutes later--

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: --this woman is--

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --literally jumping
up and down in my waiting room,

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.449 align:middle line:90%
saying, I'm fixed, I'm fixed.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:44.449 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just from that?

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.657 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: She said the
instant she took the chromium,

00:34:46.657 --> 00:34:47.690 align:middle line:90%
the pain was gone.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.648 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me-- she
said, how did that work?

00:34:49.648 --> 00:34:50.920 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I have no idea.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't know.

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:90%
That is amazing.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.679 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: I had no idea.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:56.929 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a show on
Gaia called "Open Minds,"

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:00.199 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Joe Dispenza was
on it talking about all

00:35:00.199 --> 00:35:01.490 align:middle line:90%
of what you've been mentioning.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.781 align:middle line:10%
>>JOE DISPENZA: Thoughts are
the language of the brain,

00:35:03.781 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:10%
and feelings are the
language of the body.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.010 align:middle line:10%
And how you think and how you
feel creates a state of being.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking certain
thoughts that make you happy,

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:84%
those thoughts will produce
certain chemicals in your body

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:84%
for you to begin to feel exactly
the way you were just thinking.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.020 align:middle line:84%
The moment you feel
the way you think,

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.000 align:middle line:84%
you begin to think
the way you feel.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.990 align:middle line:84%
The redundancy of that cycle,
Regina, over time, conditions

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:29.020 align:middle line:90%
the body to become the mind.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And once the body becomes the
mind, that's called a habit.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is science.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.430 align:middle line:84%
95% of who we are by the
time we're 35 years old

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:40.375 align:middle line:84%
is a set of memorized behaviors,
emotional reactions, beliefs,

00:35:40.375 --> 00:35:41.750 align:middle line:84%
perceptions, and
attitudes that--

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: 95%-- and
we think we have free will.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.138 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:45.138 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So they function like a
subconscious computer program.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So the great example
you can use is--

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.040 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to be
over 35 for this,

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.331 align:middle line:84%
but you may not be able to
consciously remember a phone

00:35:54.331 --> 00:35:56.930 align:middle line:84%
number, but you can pick up
the phone, look at the numbers,

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:58.325 align:middle line:84%
and your fingers
dial the number.

00:35:58.325 --> 00:35:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You've
practiced it so many times

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:03.780 align:middle line:84%
that your body knows
better than your brain.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes time
to change and people

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.020 align:middle line:84%
are using 5% of
their conscious mind

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to go against 95% of what they
programmed subconsciously,

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.040 align:middle line:84%
you can think
positively all you want,

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.690 align:middle line:84%
but if you've been
feeling negatively

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:21.080 align:middle line:84%
for the last 35 years, that's
mind and body in opposition.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.670 align:middle line:84%
You could create
your dream board

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and have all your beautiful
pictures of your future.

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:29.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you feel unworthy, that's
mind and body in opposition.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.670 align:middle line:84%
You have to recondition
the body to a new mind.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the process that

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.930 align:middle line:84%
makes this so unique
as human beings

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:38.510 align:middle line:84%
is a fact that we
can think about what

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.950 align:middle line:90%
we're thinking about.

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.695 align:middle line:90%
We can notice how we're acting.

00:36:41.695 --> 00:36:43.070 align:middle line:84%
We can pay attention
to how we're

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.440 align:middle line:84%
feeling, which means we can
modify our states of being

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.700 align:middle line:90%
to do a better job in life.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And that level of
metacognition or mindfulness,

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:51.830 align:middle line:84%
because the size of
the frontal lobe,

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.380 align:middle line:84%
allows us to begin to
observe who we're being

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.975 align:middle line:84%
so we can do a
better job in life.

00:36:55.975 --> 00:36:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm
beginning to realize

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:01.700 align:middle line:84%
that the mind is an amazing
factor in all of this.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Oh, absolutely.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:06.032 align:middle line:90%


00:37:06.032 --> 00:37:08.610 align:middle line:90%
It's the controlling factor.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:13.040 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind is,
like I said, where we live

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and where we spend
all of our time.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.620 align:middle line:84%
But the subconscious
mind is the part of us

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.580 align:middle line:84%
that we need to get aligned,
you see, with the conscious.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:23.991 align:middle line:90%
Let me say it this way.

00:37:23.991 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine that
this hand of mine

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.400 align:middle line:84%
represents your conscious
mind, and this hand

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.410 align:middle line:84%
represents your
subconscious mind.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, if with your conscious mind
you want to go this direction,

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.829 align:middle line:84%
but with your
subconscious mind--

00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It takes
you someplace else.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:38.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: If it's
going this way,

00:37:38.745 --> 00:37:40.820 align:middle line:84%
that's the direction
you're going to go.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.560 align:middle line:84%
But as you release
these imbalances,

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.560 align:middle line:84%
like trapped emotions and
other kinds of things,

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.320 align:middle line:84%
from your subconscious
mind, what happens

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:84%
is it brings it more
and more into alignment

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.039 align:middle line:90%
with the conscious mind.

00:37:53.039 --> 00:37:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And when the conscious
and the subconscious

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
are actually in
alignment, that's

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:01.520 align:middle line:84%
when things can really
start to manifest for you.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to the woman
who needed the chromium.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Right.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you know
exactly what she needed?

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.440 align:middle line:10%
Did you do a blood
chemistry test?

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: No.

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:13.760 align:middle line:84%
In the Body Code, you
see, the Body Code

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.620 align:middle line:90%
is a mind-mapping system.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.970 align:middle line:10%
And so at the first
page of the mind map,

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:10%
we have these six
kinds of imbalances.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And the way that it works is,
similar to the Emotion Code,

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.400 align:middle line:90%
we ask the subconscious mind--

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.470 align:middle line:84%
because it knows what's
in the Body Code,

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.660 align:middle line:84%
it knows what's in
the whole thing,

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.600 align:middle line:84%
all 867 nodes and
understands it perfectly--

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.910 align:middle line:84%
as soon as it came out,
the subconscious mind

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:41.060 align:middle line:84%
of every person knew what was in
there because the subconscious

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.280 align:middle line:84%
mind of every person is
tied into this database

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:90%
of universal intelligence.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I simply asked, well,
where do we need to go?

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:48.860 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And looking at the
Body Code, I asked,

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.030 align:middle line:84%
is it something
on the left side?

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:90%
We have the six nodes.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And it said, no, it
was on the right side.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Is it this one?

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.200 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:57.620 align:middle line:90%
This one?

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:58.460 align:middle line:90%
This one?

00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was probably testing
myself, I don't remember,

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:90%
but testing her either way.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.390 align:middle line:10%
And so that, then,
opens up another node.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:06.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a mind-mapping system.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.240 align:middle line:90%
There are multiple levels.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.999 align:middle line:90%
It brought up this next node.

00:39:09.999 --> 00:39:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
on the left side.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It was something
on the right side,

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.043 align:middle line:90%
according to the muscle testing.

00:39:14.043 --> 00:39:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Her subconscious mind
was taking me there,

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.680 align:middle line:90%
and we went to nutritional.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.420 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't foods or herbs.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.720 align:middle line:90%
It was nutrients.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.060 align:middle line:90%
So we went to nutrients.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.010 align:middle line:10%
And then that brings up a chart,
like the chart of emotions

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:26.810 align:middle line:10%
in the emotion--

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:27.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'm astounded by this.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.430 align:middle line:10%
This is amazing.

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:30.054 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: Column A,
column B-- oh yeah.

00:39:30.054 --> 00:39:33.360 align:middle line:10%
And so then we simply ask,
well, is it in column A?

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.160 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.750 align:middle line:10%
Is it in one of the odd rows?

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:36.830 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:37.880 align:middle line:90%
Is it in row one?

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.600 align:middle line:90%
Is it this nutrient?

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.400 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Is it this one?

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:41.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.900 align:middle line:10%
Oh, it's this one, chromium.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.360 align:middle line:10%
Oh, right.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.595 align:middle line:10%
This is not unusual.

00:39:45.595 --> 00:39:47.220 align:middle line:84%
There was another
woman that I saw once

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.060 align:middle line:84%
who had a problem
with a chronic cough,

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and it'd been going
on for a year.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:54.310 align:middle line:90%
And it was so bad.

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:55.890 align:middle line:90%
She was coughing all night long.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Her husband had moved
out of their bedroom

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.500 align:middle line:90%
to the other end of the house.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.300 align:middle line:90%
And she told me--

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was that
annoying for the guy.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: It was that bad.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.020 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't sleep.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, neither could she.

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But she told me-- she
said, I'm afraid that this

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:11.380 align:middle line:84%
is going to really possibly
end my marriage because it's

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.380 align:middle line:84%
so difficult. And she'd
been to different people

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't tell
her what was wrong.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like snoring.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:16.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:40:16.135 --> 00:40:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Probably worse, even.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.045 align:middle line:84%
And so I tested her
and found that she

00:40:21.045 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of a chemical
that was the underlying reason.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I say I tested, I'm
just asking her body questions

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and letting her subconscious
mind guide me to the answer,

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.500 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And what came up was
some kind of a chemical.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And so through intuition and
doing a little more testing,

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.480 align:middle line:90%
I figured out what it was.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:44.040 align:middle line:84%
The chemical was
Campho-Phenique.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And she became all
of a sudden pale.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me she
said, Campho-Phenique?

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.584 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah,
I think that's--

00:40:51.584 --> 00:40:53.000 align:middle line:84%
at least that's
what's showing up.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, I think you
have a problem with it.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.150 align:middle line:90%
And she said, well, you know--

00:40:56.150 --> 00:41:00.560 align:middle line:84%
she said, every night, I
take care of this old lady.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.270 align:middle line:84%
She says, I go over
there every night.

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And right as I'm
putting her to bed,

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.840 align:middle line:84%
the last thing
she likes me to do

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.100 align:middle line:84%
is rub her feet with
Campho-Phenique.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: And I said, OK, well--

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this lady's
breathing it in and everything.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.000 align:middle line:90%
And that was the toxin.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.370 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.344 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or it probably
gets through her skin.

00:41:16.344 --> 00:41:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Oh, totally, yeah.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:18.710 align:middle line:90%
So I released that from her.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was it,
no more trouble.

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was it.

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So you see, the
subconscious knows.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is--
believe me, George,

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.950 align:middle line:84%
this is the future of
all healing, I believe,

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:29.570 align:middle line:90%
is to finally--

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.790 align:middle line:84%
after all of these
years and thousands

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:35.970 align:middle line:84%
of years of mankind's existence,
we're finally figuring out,

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:41.210 align:middle line:84%
wow, our subconscious minds
know really what's wrong with us

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:42.320 align:middle line:90%
and what needs to be done.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a few
moments, you're

00:41:43.695 --> 00:41:45.410 align:middle line:84%
going to do a little
demonstration on me,

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'll have you
go through that.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:49.445 align:middle line:84%
Now, can anybody
learn the Body Code?

00:41:49.445 --> 00:41:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Absolutely.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can?

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, and
that was the message

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.600 align:middle line:84%
that I got-- make this available
to everyone everywhere.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.141 align:middle line:84%
So that's the mission
of our company,

00:41:56.141 --> 00:41:58.790 align:middle line:84%
see, is we're getting
this translated

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:02.240 align:middle line:84%
into different
languages, and our plan

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.910 align:middle line:84%
is to make it available
to everybody everywhere--

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:06.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:42:06.365 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: --as fast as we can.

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.158 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
there's nothing more

00:42:09.158 --> 00:42:12.320 align:middle line:84%
important than your health,
because without it, you

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.660 align:middle line:84%
can't take care of yourself,
you can't take care

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:16.010 align:middle line:90%
of the people you care about.

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me,
personally, Brad,

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.570 align:middle line:90%
is the most important thing.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: So true.

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The people you
care about depend on you.

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
feeling well, you're

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.880 align:middle line:84%
not going to be able
to do much for them.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
be able to fix that.

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Absolutely right.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, the beauty of this work,
the Emotion Code and the Body

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Code, as well, is that
it empowers people.

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Imagine being able to know why,
in the middle of the night,

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:48.600 align:middle line:84%
your child wakes up screaming
with some kind of a problem.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.140 align:middle line:84%
We have testimonials,
thousands of testimonials

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.540 align:middle line:84%
literally from all over the
world, and a lot of them

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:59.040 align:middle line:84%
are from parents who have found
that their child had something

00:42:59.040 --> 00:42:59.840 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.673 align:middle line:84%
They were able to release
that and fix that.

00:43:01.673 --> 00:43:02.930 align:middle line:90%
For example, leg aches--

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I was reading a testimonial
just the other day about a--

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cramps.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:06.892 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Leg cramps-- right.

00:43:06.892 --> 00:43:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I was reading a
testimonial the other day

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.080 align:middle line:84%
from a couple who wrote in
said that their daughter would

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.670 align:middle line:90%
get these terrible leg cramps.

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.560 align:middle line:84%
The husband was a
massage therapist.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So he would massage
this little girl's legs,

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.580 align:middle line:84%
but it would be a
very difficult thing.

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:23.160 align:middle line:90%
And it happened again.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.570 align:middle line:84%
It had been going
on for a while.

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And then she suddenly
has this realization.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.780 align:middle line:84%
You know what, maybe
there's something emotional.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And within three minutes,
the pain had all stopped.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.360 align:middle line:84%
The little girl had
stopped shaking with pain.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And they've never
come back, see.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.090 align:middle line:90%
And so think about this.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:42.830 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
here, George, really,

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:47.074 align:middle line:84%
is that that higher power,
call it the Creator or God

00:43:47.074 --> 00:43:47.990 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want--

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever it is.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.198 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: But I
believe that what's

00:43:50.198 --> 00:43:55.970 align:middle line:84%
happening is this healing work,
the Emotion Code and the Body

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Code, they're very unique
healing methods because they're

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:01.440 align:middle line:90%
incredibly simple, very simple.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.730 align:middle line:84%
They're very rapid, very fast,
and easily learned by anyone.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
the fact that there's

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:13.090 align:middle line:84%
so much healing that needs
to take place in this world.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:17.960 align:middle line:90%
And so this is an invention.

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.770 align:middle line:90%
These things are coming.

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:21.940 align:middle line:84%
They've come through
me just because I

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.320 align:middle line:90%
was the person chosen to do it.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But these things
aren't about me.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:29.110 align:middle line:84%
They're about everyone
else, you see,

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and they're about
giving back this power.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if everybody
in the world

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.900 align:middle line:84%
or even just a significant
number of people in the world

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.310 align:middle line:90%
can become healers.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.990 align:middle line:84%
That's where we need to go,
see, because the healing has

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.790 align:middle line:90%
to take place.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:45.280 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to get to
this next sort of iteration

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.570 align:middle line:90%
of the world, it has to happen.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:50.449 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you utilize
these techniques on yourself?

00:44:50.449 --> 00:44:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Oh, absolutely.

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:52.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Constantly?

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Well, whenever--

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.440 align:middle line:90%
I check myself periodically.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
fascinating things,

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.820 align:middle line:84%
for example, that we've
found in the Body Code

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.620 align:middle line:84%
is that anciently
the Chinese believed,

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:08.290 align:middle line:84%
the ancient physicians believed
that the organs and the body

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and the glands
were like officials

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.704 align:middle line:84%
in the kingdom of the body,
and different organs and glands

00:45:12.704 --> 00:45:14.620 align:middle line:84%
were subservient to
others, and there were all

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.400 align:middle line:90%
these interconnections, right?

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe they
were absolutely right.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that all the
organs, all the glands,

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.360 align:middle line:84%
all the tissues in your body,
they're all intelligent,

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually ask
them if they're happy or not.

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
use the Body Code.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.352 align:middle line:84%
We believe that this is
the most advanced form

00:45:36.352 --> 00:45:38.560 align:middle line:84%
of preventive medicine that's
available on the planet

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.580 align:middle line:84%
because when you actually
ask this person's organs

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and glands if they're happy,
decades before they'd ever

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:50.610 align:middle line:84%
need to really have major
intervention, they'll tell you.

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.711 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you know
what, I'm not happy.

00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's just done
through muscle testing.

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.585 align:middle line:84%
But if an organ or a gland
or some part of the body

00:45:56.585 --> 00:45:59.230 align:middle line:84%
is not happy, then we
can figure out why.

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:00.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is it?

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.169 align:middle line:84%
Is it because there's
emotional baggage there?

00:46:02.169 --> 00:46:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Is it because you don't
have the right nutrients?

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Is it because you got
toxicity going on?

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:08.800 align:middle line:90%
What is it that's happening?

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.810 align:middle line:90%
And the body will tell you.

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.012 align:middle line:84%
And what I did see--
for the last 10 years

00:46:13.012 --> 00:46:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that I was in practice, most
of the people that I saw

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.928 align:middle line:84%
had been told there
was no help for them,

00:46:16.928 --> 00:46:20.110 align:middle line:84%
no hope for them at all, that
what they had was incurable.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And yet, what I found was
by asking their bodies,

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.590 align:middle line:84%
by asking the subconscious
mind what they really needed

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and addressing
those needs, I was

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.070 align:middle line:84%
able to actually help almost
all of them with just--

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I could count the
exceptions on one hand.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how
powerful it is.

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's so much more simple
than we ever imagined, see,

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:43.540 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the
epiphany that hit you?

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Beyond when you
were a young boy,

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:84%
beyond as you got into
medicine and chiropractic, what

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:58.090 align:middle line:84%
was that aha moment that
hit you and you said,

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:01.201 align:middle line:84%
this is what I want
to do for a living?

00:47:01.201 --> 00:47:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Oh, well, it was when
I was healed of kidney disease

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.770 align:middle line:90%
by the two--

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:10.140 align:middle line:84%
they were really osteopathic
physicians that--

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.740 align:middle line:84%
if you remember, I think it
was in the early '60s or maybe

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:16.310 align:middle line:84%
late '50s when the osteopathic
profession was kind of engulfed

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:17.185 align:middle line:90%
by the AMA.

00:47:17.185 --> 00:47:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They hated them,
didn't they, for a while?

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Exactly.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.106 align:middle line:84%
And that's why rather than
trying to get rid of them

00:47:22.106 --> 00:47:24.460 align:middle line:84%
anymore, they said, you
can become like us and you

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.460 align:middle line:90%
can prescribe and so on.

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.360 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.620 align:middle line:84%
These two stayed out of
it, these two physicians,

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and so they practiced
out on the edge of town,

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:38.545 align:middle line:84%
in Great Falls, Montana where
I grew up, in a wheat field.

00:47:38.545 --> 00:47:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But yet, they
would have busloads

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.820 align:middle line:90%
of people coming to see them.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
ones who healed me.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you what happened.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.904 align:middle line:84%
I decided I knew that
they had fixed me

00:47:50.904 --> 00:47:52.070 align:middle line:90%
and that they had healed me.

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they had done
was exactly what I needed.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you know
what they had done?

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:57.096 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, they
were working on me,

00:47:57.096 --> 00:47:59.240 align:middle line:84%
realigning the
spine and giving me

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.400 align:middle line:90%
certain concoctions and things.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.670 align:middle line:84%
But I knew in my heart that
what they had done had fixed me,

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and I was well,
because the pains

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.250 align:middle line:84%
that I had would be like
being stabbed with a knife,

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.250 align:middle line:84%
would put me on the ground,
take my breath away.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:13.185 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible.

00:48:13.185 --> 00:48:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But within about
three weeks, the pains

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:16.790 align:middle line:84%
were much less frequent,
much less severe.

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And within about a month,
I didn't have any more pain

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:19.510 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:20.990 align:middle line:90%
I was only 13 years old.

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'd forgotten that
I'd ever been sick.

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And my parents took me
back to the hospital,

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and they ran all the tests
again, and, as I recall,

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:27.630 align:middle line:84%
they ran the tests twice,
and they said, well,

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:28.790 align:middle line:90%
it's a spontaneous remission.

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:30.164 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we did
must have helped.

00:48:30.164 --> 00:48:33.200 align:middle line:84%
But I knew these other
people had really helped me.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So I decided that's
what I wanted to do.

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember
lying on my back

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:39.780 align:middle line:84%
on their table saying,
when I grow up--

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.599 align:middle line:84%
13 years old-- when I grow up,
I want to do what you're doing.

00:48:42.599 --> 00:48:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
their response was?

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: They
said, no, you don't.

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.680 align:middle line:84%
They said, if you go
to chiropractic school

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.900 align:middle line:84%
or you go to some
healing school,

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.657 align:middle line:84%
they'll fill your head so
full of fixed ideas and dogmas

00:48:53.657 --> 00:48:56.240 align:middle line:84%
that you won't be able to think
for yourself when you get out.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'll forget.

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yeah, you'll
be like a zombie.

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:00.950 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought--

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:04.200 align:middle line:84%
so when I went to chiropractic
school, I was really on guard.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I thought, OK.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.166 align:middle line:84%
Teachers would say things
like, well, we figured out

00:49:07.166 --> 00:49:10.190 align:middle line:84%
this is the best way to do this,
and my internal response was,

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:13.205 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe, but maybe
there's a better way.

00:49:13.205 --> 00:49:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Find a better way.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: So I
was radically open

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.020 align:middle line:90%
when I went through school.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And I got a lot of ribbing from
my colleagues and classmates

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:22.710 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:26.060 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
where I needed

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:31.790 align:middle line:84%
to be to be able to bring these
healing methods into the world

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:35.360 align:middle line:84%
because they're radically
different from everything else.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Part of
your Body Code, you

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.140 align:middle line:90%
have an app that you work with.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.109 align:middle line:90%
Did you create it?

00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
it and you can tell us

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.090 align:middle line:90%
what we're looking at.

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: OK.

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you create this?

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, I
created this using

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.240 align:middle line:90%
some mind-mapping software.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we went
to programmers that helped

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.360 align:middle line:90%
us to get it into the system.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Here you can see we're
looking at the pathogen page.

00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:59.600 align:middle line:90%
And here's the main page.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Now we're looking
at misalignments.

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:03.930 align:middle line:90%
And any tissue can misalign.

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So they're all
represented there.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:08.235 align:middle line:84%
Here you can see we're going
into the bones of the body.

00:50:08.235 --> 00:50:09.860 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
various different ribs.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's pretty
elaborate, isn't it?

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: It really is.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:12.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.200 align:middle line:84%
It took me a year to
create the first one.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And here we're looking
at different nutrients,

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and you can see there's
chromium right there on the top.

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
find things, you see.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.300 align:middle line:84%
We totally allow the
subconscious mind

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.850 align:middle line:84%
to guide us and take us
wherever it wants to take us,

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and it is so much
smarter than we are.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.100 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:90%
So here's heavy metals.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
give you conclusions?

00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:39.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: Well, every time
you go into a certain area,

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:41.490 align:middle line:10%
you can click or just tap--

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:43.970 align:middle line:10%
it runs on all the different
devices, mobile devices and so

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:45.470 align:middle line:10%
on-- and it'll give
you explanations

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:46.400 align:middle line:10%
about what something might be.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.900 align:middle line:10%
For example here's
the crown chakra,

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:52.130 align:middle line:10%
and there's the explanation
about what it is and what to do

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:53.470 align:middle line:10%
and how to correct these things.

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's really this
tremendous knowledge base

00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:59.030 align:middle line:90%
that exists in this software.

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:01.020 align:middle line:84%
It's patented
software, by the way.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But it includes every
imbalance that I

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.290 align:middle line:90%
found during all those years.

00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:09.110 align:middle line:84%
It's been 30 years now as
a holistic chiropractic

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:10.160 align:middle line:90%
physician.

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a way
to really learn

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:16.910 align:middle line:84%
how the body works
at the same time

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.160 align:middle line:84%
that you're finding
things and fixing

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.070 align:middle line:90%
things that need to be fixed.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, is there something
that people would use at home?

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.636 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Absolutely,
they can use it at home.

00:51:25.636 --> 00:51:27.380 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the youngest
person that we

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.600 align:middle line:10%
know of who uses The
Body Code successfully

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.810 align:middle line:10%
is, I believe, six years old.

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Six years old?

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:34.811 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Six years old--

00:51:34.811 --> 00:51:36.320 align:middle line:90%
she lives in Mexico City.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And her mom told us that she
has The Body Code on her iPad,

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and her daughter will
use The Body Code

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and tap through and
find imbalances.

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:49.490 align:middle line:10%
And then she'll take the
iPad to her mom and say,

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.460 align:middle line:10%
Mommy, Daddy has this,
or you have this,

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:56.429 align:middle line:10%
and her mom will check and the
little girl is always right.

00:51:56.429 --> 00:51:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:00.092 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to do a
little demonstration on me.

00:52:00.092 --> 00:52:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to give it a try?

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.424 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:52:02.424 --> 00:52:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we'll feed in
some things that you need.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Sure.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So I have The Body
Code on my iPad here.

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: So the
first thing that we

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:17.570 align:middle line:84%
like to do, because this work
really has come from up above,

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:19.400 align:middle line:84%
we like to take
a moment and just

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.300 align:middle line:84%
make a connection with
that higher power.

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And it just takes a moment.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And just make sure
that we're connected.

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.636 align:middle line:90%
And then what we can do is--

00:52:29.636 --> 00:52:32.010 align:middle line:84%
you see, the human body puts
out this energy field that's

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:33.870 align:middle line:90%
about 12 feet in diameter.

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:36.400 align:middle line:84%
It extends out about 6 feet
from every side of the body.

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's
hitting you, right?

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: It's
hitting me right now.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So what I can do is
I can ask questions

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:43.285 align:middle line:84%
and I can get answers
on myself using--

00:52:43.285 --> 00:52:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll just use this method
called the ring in ring method.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: So let's
look at The Body Code.

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:50.940 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at these six
possible areas of imbalance

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.710 align:middle line:90%
that are going on for you.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just ask,
first of all, what is--

00:52:58.020 --> 00:52:59.670 align:middle line:84%
we'll let your
subconscious mind--

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:01.582 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious
mind is like Google.

00:53:01.582 --> 00:53:03.540 align:middle line:84%
We can ask a question,
it'll give us an answer.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:05.490 align:middle line:84%
So what's the biggest
single imbalance

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:08.760 align:middle line:84%
that you have going on
right now that we can fix?

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.530 align:middle line:10%
The single biggest
imbalance-- and now

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:12.030 align:middle line:10%
we look at The Body
Code and we ask,

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:17.100 align:middle line:10%
OK, is this imbalance on the
right side of the chart here?

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.140 align:middle line:10%
And your body says,
no, that's weak,

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.570 align:middle line:10%
see, because your
energy changes,

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:23.527 align:middle line:10%
and it immediately
shows up in my energy.

00:53:23.527 --> 00:53:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is just picking up
something from me right now?

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: No, just my body--

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:27.865 align:middle line:84%
I'm just picking
up your changes.

00:53:27.865 --> 00:53:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're doing it.

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:29.845 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: I'm just
picking it up.

00:53:29.845 --> 00:53:31.720 align:middle line:10%
I just ask the questions,
look at the chart.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.210 align:middle line:10%
So there's something on the
left side of this chart.

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.350 align:middle line:90%
So is it a toxin?

00:53:35.350 --> 00:53:36.150 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:38.010 align:middle line:90%
So it's not that category.

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Is it something in
circuits and systems.

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:41.160 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not it either.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's something in
the energies area.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:47.370 align:middle line:10%
So what we can do, then, is we
can tap on the Energies area

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:49.480 align:middle line:10%
and it brings up another chart.

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
the different kinds

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:52.921 align:middle line:90%
of energies that this could be.

00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:54.220 align:middle line:90%
So let's see what it is.

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
it is, no idea.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do I?

00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Consciously,
no, but your subconscious

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:00.660 align:middle line:90%
knows perfectly.

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And it's
taking us there, see.

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.746 align:middle line:84%
So is this something on the
left side of this chart?

00:54:04.746 --> 00:54:05.670 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So is it addictive heart
energy or an allergy

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:09.640 align:middle line:90%
or an intolerance?

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.440 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.920 align:middle line:10%
The only one left is emotions.

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.440 align:middle line:10%
So there's something
emotional going on with you.

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Is this a trapped emotion?

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.336 align:middle line:90%
So there's our emotion chart.

00:54:21.336 --> 00:54:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And so this is actually
now the Emotion Code, which

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.720 align:middle line:90%
is in inside of the Body Code.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So here's how we
figure out the emotion.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.040 align:middle line:84%
There are 60 emotions in
this chart divided up into--

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 60.

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.561 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --60-- divided up
into two columns and six rows.

00:54:33.561 --> 00:54:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But watch how quickly we can
figure out what the emotion is.

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Is the emotion in column A?

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And the answer manifesting
from your subconscious is no.

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could be on the
other side of the planet.

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.578 align:middle line:84%
We would do it just
a little differently,

00:54:44.578 --> 00:54:47.340 align:middle line:84%
but the answers would manifest
instantly just like this.

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So we know it's not in
column A. We just got

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:50.820 align:middle line:90%
rid of 30 emotions out of 60.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.770 align:middle line:84%
It's in column B. Is it in one
of the odd rows in column B,

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:54.570 align:middle line:90%
narrowing it down?

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So now we have 15
emotions left out of 60.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Is it in column B in row one?

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:00.030 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:01.357 align:middle line:90%
So is it in row three?

00:55:01.357 --> 00:55:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It's in row three, column B.
We have five emotions left.

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: So it's either
confusion, defensiveness,

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:07.690 align:middle line:84%
grief, self-abuse,
or stubbornness.

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what it is.

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:10.450 align:middle line:90%
Is the emotion confusion?

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:11.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Is it defensiveness?

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.440 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Is the emotion grief?

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:16.100 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Is it self-abuse?

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:17.900 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Is it stubbornness?

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:19.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that
means is, you see,

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:27.660 align:middle line:84%
when the subconscious mind
takes you to a column and a row

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and then you can't figure
out what those emotions are,

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.730 align:middle line:84%
it means that the
subconscious is taking you

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:35.130 align:middle line:84%
as far as it can
take you, but you

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:37.920 align:middle line:84%
have to use a special word
now to get the answer.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.734 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see
that happen a lot?

00:55:39.734 --> 00:55:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Quite a bit.

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.030 align:middle line:90%
The word is "inherited."

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:44.400 align:middle line:84%
This is how we find
inherited energy.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.820 align:middle line:90%
So is this an inherited emotion?

00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:46.620 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.300 align:middle line:90%
So is it inherited confusion?

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.200 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Is it inherited defensiveness?

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.840 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Is it inherited grief?

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:54.900 align:middle line:90%
It's inherited grief.

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.197 align:middle line:84%
So at conception, you
got this from somebody.

00:55:57.197 --> 00:55:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Did you get it from your mother?

00:55:58.530 --> 00:55:59.330 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:00.520 align:middle line:90%
It came from your father.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Did he get it from
somebody earlier?

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.420 align:middle line:90%
From his father?

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:05.846 align:middle line:84%
And did he get it
from somebody earlier?

00:56:05.846 --> 00:56:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes, from his father.

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So we have father,
father, father.

00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Did he get it from somebody
earlier, from his father?

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:14.072 align:middle line:84%
So now we have four
generations, that quickly.

00:56:14.072 --> 00:56:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Your father gave it
to you, but he got it

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.160 align:middle line:84%
from his dad, who got
it from his dad, who

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:17.993 align:middle line:90%
got it from his dad.

00:56:17.993 --> 00:56:21.055 align:middle line:84%
Does this go back further
in time in more generations?

00:56:21.055 --> 00:56:21.855 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:56:21.855 --> 00:56:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Does it go back 10 generations?

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:24.030 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Does it go back 20?

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:25.020 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:25.490 align:middle line:90%
15?

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:26.310 align:middle line:90%
14?

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:27.110 align:middle line:90%
13?

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:27.910 align:middle line:90%
12?

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:29.224 align:middle line:90%
It goes back 12 generations.

00:56:29.224 --> 00:56:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: 12 generations-- yeah.

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:34.050 align:middle line:90%
That's about-- yeah, well--

00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:34.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 500 years?

00:56:34.885 --> 00:56:36.755 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:56:36.755 --> 00:56:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, about that.

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:40.220 align:middle line:90%
So let's ask, now--

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.060 align:middle line:90%
let's see here.

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, 10 generations--

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, are
you saying something

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:44.420 align:middle line:90%
happened 500 years ago?

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: It would be
probably about 300 years ago,

00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:47.660 align:middle line:90%
give or take.

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:51.050 align:middle line:84%
They say you use about 25.5
years for a generation.

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:54.183 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And so something
happened about 12 generations

00:56:54.183 --> 00:56:58.010 align:middle line:84%
ago to a grandfather
of yours, and he

00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:59.801 align:middle line:84%
felt this tremendous
emotion of grief.

00:56:59.801 --> 00:57:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the great
things about the day

00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and age we live in is that
you can go to Ancestry.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:05.338 align:middle line:84%
You might even be able
to pinpoint who that was

00:57:05.338 --> 00:57:06.849 align:middle line:90%
and where he lived and so on.

00:57:06.849 --> 00:57:09.140 align:middle line:84%
But it might give you an idea
what might have happened,

00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:10.250 align:middle line:90%
but we don't know.

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that energy
of grief was so powerful

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that he shared that
with his son when

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.140 align:middle line:84%
he was conceived, who
shared it with his son,

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's been handed down
or shared down the line

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.300 align:middle line:90%
all the way down to you.

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And do we need to know
any more about this?

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:26.630 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:29.627 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have I probably
passed it on to my son?

00:57:29.627 --> 00:57:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Let's ask.

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Did you pass it to your son?

00:57:31.610 --> 00:57:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a daughter?

00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have two
daughters and a son.

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Two daughters--
did you share this

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:36.190 align:middle line:90%
with them, as well?

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:37.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:39.182 align:middle line:90%
So they all got this.

00:57:39.182 --> 00:57:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So do we need to know
anything else about this?

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:41.941 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:57:41.941 --> 00:57:43.398 align:middle line:84%
But let me share
something with you

00:57:43.398 --> 00:57:44.672 align:middle line:90%
that's really interesting, OK?

00:57:44.672 --> 00:57:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Is your father still
alive or has he passed on?

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, he died.

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: He's passed on.

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.785 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He died a
couple years ago.

00:57:48.785 --> 00:57:50.243 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: One of
the things that we

00:57:50.243 --> 00:57:53.140 align:middle line:84%
find is that when we
do this inherited work,

00:57:53.140 --> 00:58:00.010 align:middle line:84%
those ancestors usually show up
for the release because they're

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:02.320 align:middle line:84%
about have something
significant released from them,

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:06.490 align:middle line:84%
wherever they are whatever
energy, whatever they're doing.

00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But let's ask, is
your father here?

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.240 align:middle line:90%
He is.

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.500 align:middle line:90%
I get a yes.

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:13.375 align:middle line:84%
Are all those other
ancestors, those fathers,

00:58:13.375 --> 00:58:15.250 align:middle line:84%
grandfathers of yours,
are they all here too?

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:16.090 align:middle line:90%
They're all here.

00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go ahead
and release this.

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to
share a story with you.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: So to release this
now, I'm connected to you,

00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and they've told us
to stay in our chairs.

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.169 align:middle line:84%
So I'd come over
and do this on you.

00:58:30.169 --> 00:58:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's OK, I can
do this on myself.

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:35.560 align:middle line:84%
We do 10 swipes of the
fingertips or a magnet

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.260 align:middle line:84%
over the governing
meridian, and that releases

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.480 align:middle line:90%
this trapped emotional energy.

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.910 align:middle line:90%
And let's see.

00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:42.160 align:middle line:90%
I think that's about 10.

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
releasing it for me?

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I'm
releasing it from you.

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's ask, did we
release that from you?

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:47.250 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Did it clear from your dad?

00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:51.607 align:middle line:84%
Did it clear from his dad,
from all those grandfathers

00:58:51.607 --> 00:58:52.690 align:middle line:90%
of yours all the way back?

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it did.

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Did it also clear from your
son and your two daughters?

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:56.710 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:58:56.710 --> 00:59:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me share
a story with you.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I was at
a conference once

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and I was asking
for a volunteer,

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and this woman comes
up out of the audience.

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:09.600 align:middle line:90%
And she's got this--

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.860 align:middle line:90%
she limps up there.

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:13.500 align:middle line:84%
She's got a pain in her
hip that's about a nine

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.349 align:middle line:90%
on a zero to 10 scale.

00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And she says she's
had it for a year,

00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:18.723 align:middle line:84%
and she's been to
different people, doctors.

00:59:18.723 --> 00:59:20.850 align:middle line:84%
They haven't been able to
fix it or figure it out.

00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So I tune into her, and
I start testing her,

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and I find an
imbalance, and I fix it,

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and the pain goes
from a nine to a four.

00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing that I find

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:35.490 align:middle line:84%
is that she has an
inherited emotion of fear,

00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:37.060 align:middle line:90%
and it goes back--

00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was 12
generations, like this one.

00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:41.890 align:middle line:84%
You never know-- went
back 12 generations.

00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:43.740 align:middle line:90%
And so I muscle tested her.

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:44.940 align:middle line:90%
I had her hold out her arm.

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:46.648 align:middle line:84%
She'd gotten it from
her father, and he'd

00:59:46.648 --> 00:59:48.760 align:middle line:84%
gotten it from his father,
just like this one.

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I had her hold her arm out
and I said, OK, are those

00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:54.790 align:middle line:84%
grandfathers all here
with us right now?

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And the answer came back
very, very strong, yes.

00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I released the
emotion, and the pain

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.480 align:middle line:84%
was completely gone,
and she's literally

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:07.020 align:middle line:84%
dancing around the stage,
this woman who had limped up.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It was so bad before
that she'd literally

01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:13.180 align:middle line:84%
have to manually lift her leg
to get in and out of her car.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And so she eventually goes
back out to the audience,

01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I finish my lecture, and I
go back to our little booth

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.809 align:middle line:84%
that we have there
with some of my staff.

01:00:21.809 --> 01:00:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And about a minute after
I got back to the booth,

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:26.462 align:middle line:84%
a woman comes up to the booth
and here's what she says.

01:00:26.462 --> 01:00:27.670 align:middle line:90%
She says, listen, Dr. Nelson.

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:30.480 align:middle line:84%
She said, I want you
to know something.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.460 align:middle line:84%
She said, I was in the
audience there, and she said,

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.690 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know that I have
had this gift, this ability

01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:38.490 align:middle line:84%
to see spirits that
other people don't see,

01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:39.780 align:middle line:90%
and I've had it all my life.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And you've talked
to people like this.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.724 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And there
are more of these

01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that are coming out
of the woodwork now,

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:46.750 align:middle line:84%
people like this
that have this gift.

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
But she said, I
wanted you to know,

01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
she said, when you were talking
about those ancestors of hers,

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:53.170 align:middle line:84%
that they were on the
stage there with you,

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:54.414 align:middle line:90%
she said, I saw all of them.

01:00:54.414 --> 01:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
They were just
like you described.

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:56.940 align:middle line:90%
They were right there.

01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But, she said, there was
something else going on,

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that she said, I don't know if
you were aware of, she said,

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:06.780 align:middle line:84%
what I saw was
surrounding the stage were

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:13.190 align:middle line:84%
at least 200 spirits of this
woman's unborn descendants.

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And she said they were there
rejoicing that they were not

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:19.890 align:middle line:84%
going to have to take
on this crippling energy

01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:20.950 align:middle line:90%
from this woman.

01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And I just
thought, wow, no, I

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.760 align:middle line:90%
was not aware of that.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, in my
case, with this release,

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.322 align:middle line:90%
what will I feel or see?

01:01:30.322 --> 01:01:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: I don't know.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
But your subconscious
mind said that's what

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:33.920 align:middle line:90%
you needed to have done.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's gone now?

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.158 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Now, what
we can do is we

01:01:36.158 --> 01:01:38.619 align:middle line:84%
can ask where that energy
was because, you see,

01:01:38.619 --> 01:01:40.160 align:middle line:84%
when you have a
trapped emotion, it's

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.900 align:middle line:84%
like a little ball
of energy from about

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:45.020 align:middle line:84%
the size of a baseball to
maybe the size of a softball.

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And these will lodge and
reside somewhere in the body,

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.780 align:middle line:84%
usually in the trunk,
but you never know.

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But we can do is we
can get some more

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:53.270 align:middle line:90%
information about this emotion.

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Where was this
thing in your body?

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Was it on the left side
of your body, this energy?

01:01:58.290 --> 01:01:59.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:00.007 align:middle line:90%
Was it in the midline?

01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:00.806 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:02:00.806 --> 01:02:02.580 align:middle line:84%
It was on the right
side of your body.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So I like to use the diaphragm,
that thin sheet-like muscle.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a great divider between
upper and lower body.

01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So was this above
your diaphragm?

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:14.070 align:middle line:84%
No, it was in the
lower part there.

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:15.920 align:middle line:90%
So was it affecting the colon?

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Was it in the abdomen?

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Lower abdomen?

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Lower right abdomen?

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So here's-- I'll tell you
exactly what it was probably

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.880 align:middle line:90%
doing.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a little valve
down there called

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:28.250 align:middle line:90%
the ileocecal valve where--

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
when you eat food, it
goes in the stomach,

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.270 align:middle line:84%
then in the small intestine,
and it goes around and around,

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:33.686 align:middle line:84%
and eventually the
small intestine

01:02:33.686 --> 01:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
joins the large intestine in the
right lower area of the body.

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And right above the appendix
is where this little valve is.

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:43.180 align:middle line:90%
It's called the ileocecal valve.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.910 align:middle line:10%
This emotion would tend
to short out that valve.

01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:51.680 align:middle line:10%
And so that would
maybe tend to cause--

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.570 align:middle line:10%
could tend to
cause low back pain

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:56.120 align:middle line:10%
and/or maybe some
right hip pain for you,

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.730 align:middle line:10%
or it might tend to
create discomfort down

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:03.008 align:middle line:10%
in that right lower area
for you of the abdomen,

01:03:03.008 --> 01:03:06.860 align:middle line:10%
and/or it may cause
sinus drainage for you,

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:10.130 align:middle line:10%
because when people have this
phenomenon, this malfunctioning

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:13.550 align:middle line:10%
valve, fecal material,
it's supposed

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:14.979 align:middle line:10%
to go through that
valve, and then

01:03:14.979 --> 01:03:17.270 align:middle line:10%
that valve is supposed to
shut the door behind it so it

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:19.730 align:middle line:10%
doesn't back flow-- it's
supposed to be a one-way valve.

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:23.060 align:middle line:84%
When the valve malfunctions,
you tend to not eliminate

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.000 align:middle line:90%
as well as you should.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the body will start
to reabsorb waste materials

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.170 align:middle line:90%
into the blood.

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing that happens,

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.210 align:middle line:84%
they start to overflow
from the blood,

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and they overflow through
the nasal sinuses.

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:37.702 align:middle line:84%
So you'll tend-- not
everybody, but a lot

01:03:37.702 --> 01:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
of people who have
this kind of imbalance

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.520 align:middle line:90%
will tend to get sinus drainage.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And so their sinuses
might drain, drain, drain.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:45.151 align:middle line:84%
They might think
they have allergies.

01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:48.080 align:middle line:84%
They might take allergy
medication when in reality it's

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.720 align:middle line:84%
this valve that's about
as far from the sinuses

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.560 align:middle line:90%
as you can think.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.360 align:middle line:90%
So-- yeah.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So any of those issues,
I think this may

01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:56.222 align:middle line:90%
have actually manifested as.

01:03:56.222 --> 01:03:58.430 align:middle line:10%
