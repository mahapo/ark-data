>>BRUCE GOLDBERG:
Spirit guide is

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.600 align:middle line:84%
somebody who was human, went
through a very complicated

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.240 align:middle line:84%
procedure and evolved
spiritually enough where

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.500 align:middle line:90%
they can advise us.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.770 align:middle line:84%
My higher self and
spirit guides got

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.220 align:middle line:84%
me to become more of the past
life therapist energy healer

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.500 align:middle line:90%
rather than just a dentist.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:84%
This woman, I call
her Eileen, she

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:84%
was in the hospital
for pancreatic cancer.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling her, look,
there's nothing we can do.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:90%
You're toast.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, a young resident
comes, Dr. Hendricks.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:84%
He goes into his pocket,
pulls out a pen flashlight,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:84%
shines a blue-green laser beam
on her abdomen, and he leaves.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.555 align:middle line:84%
The oncologist calls her
up and says, no cancer.

00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Whoa.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Dr.
Henricks doesn't exist.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is
no Dr. Hendricks.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And nobody was
sent to her room that day.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.217 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That's
a spirit guide.

A very special
guest back with us,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Bruce Goldberg, who holds
advanced degrees in counseling

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:10%
psychology, conducts a thriving
international hypnotherapy

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:10%

been a practicing dentist.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And he specializes in
reincarnation, time travel,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness
of growing.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.535 align:middle line:90%
Bruce, welcome back.

00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Well thank you.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for allowing me
to reincarnate with you.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.568 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You reincarnate
quite well, my friend.

00:01:27.568 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, it
takes one to know one.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: I've been fine.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.693 align:middle line:84%
And today we're going
to be discussing

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
spirit guides, and
angels, and how

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
people can improve their life
by accessing spirit guides,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and by being all they
can be, all naturally

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:90%
and all karmically indicated.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a spirit guide?

00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So
let's separate it.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:10%
Spirit guide is somebody who
was human and had a life,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:10%
and then crossed into spirit
or clinically died, went

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:10%
through a very
complicated procedure,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:10%
and evolved spiritually enough
where they can advise us.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.670 align:middle line:90%
So they were human.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:84%
The difference between a
spirit guide and an angel

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
is an angel is a direct
messenger of God.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
It comes right from
the God energy complex.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:90%
So an angel was never human.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:90%
They are perfect energy sources.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.390 align:middle line:10%
So spirit guides, there's
a whole wide range of them.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:10%
And we can discuss them now.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:10%
You have what we call
the animal spirits.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Like the Native
American cultures

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.000 align:middle line:84%
will talk about how a
spirit guide can come across

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
as a wolf, or a eagle,
or a bear, et cetera.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Those are called protectors.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.900 align:middle line:90%
And they help us in our lives.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Then there are what we
call the chemist guides.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
The chemist guides
are the ones that

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.210 align:middle line:90%
deal with biochemical issues.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.440 align:middle line:84%
If you have cancer, you have
AIDS, or lupus, or any kind

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
of biochemical disorder,
the chemist guides

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:84%
can help you to eliminate
those from your life.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Then there are what we
call the doctor guides.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:84%
The doctor guides
help you overcome

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.632 align:middle line:84%
emotional, mental problems
and some spiritual issues.

00:02:49.632 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Then there are the
gatekeepers that

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:84%
give you psychic protection
from negative entities.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And finally there are
the messenger guides

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:84%
who help you with developing
your psychic abilities,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
like out of body
experiences, telepathy,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
going into past
and future lives,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
reading your Akashic
records, helping you

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:90%
in any kind of psychic gift.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So those are a
wide range of them.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce, do
these guides come to us

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.667 align:middle line:90%
or do we summon them up?

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well
they can come to you.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:84%
But I develop a technique--
my famous Superconscious Mind

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Tap--

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
where I train the patient
to access the higher self.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So the higher self,
the superconscious mind

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.867 align:middle line:84%
as we call it, brings
in the spirit guides.

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there are
many different types.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:84%
You actually have what we call
an inner band of spirit guides.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:84%
There's maybe a
dozen or so that work

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
with a person for the various
issues I just talked about.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And then as you
evolve spiritually,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
you change and you get
more advanced spirit

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.030 align:middle line:90%
guides coming in.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So the more you evolve, they
give you higher level guides

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:90%
to work with you.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Remember all this is
organized by the higher self.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:84%
The higher self is
like a dispatcher

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:90%
of the various guides.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the
angels spirit guides?

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:90%
The angels are separate.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.637 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned,
they come directly

00:03:54.637 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:90%
from the God energy complex.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So they're considered
to be messengers of God.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.210 align:middle line:84%
By the way, all
religions show angels.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:84%
They're always
ubiquitously represented.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Spirit guides are
pretty common, too.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But you have to separate an
angel which is a perfect energy

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
source from the
spirit guide which

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
was previously in the
human form and then just

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:90%
simply crossed into spirit.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Like a Buddha kind
of thing, think

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.130 align:middle line:90%
of that as a spirit guide.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've interviewed
author Corin Grillo

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
who talks about angels coming
to us from different dimensions.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:10%
- What do you think
of that, the fact

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.570 align:middle line:10%
that angels may come from
these other dimensions?

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.370 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Well I do agree that they
come from other dimensions

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:84%
or that the original source
is God, or creator, whatever

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:90%
you want to call it.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
point, it begins

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.020 align:middle line:84%
to separate, separate, separate
into different emanations.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:10%
And so angels are one
of the beautiful beings

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.380 align:middle line:10%
that have come from that.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:10%
Something else that
was interesting

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:10%
is that there's angels
that really are here

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.800 align:middle line:10%
to connect us with source,
connect us with love,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:10%
and connect us with our own
sovereign truth as a divinity

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:10%
here on Earth.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But I also have a
different insight

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:84%
about the dark side or
the demons, if you will,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:84%
that are the polar
opposite of angels.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.208 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things
that I have been shown

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:10%
is that sometimes it's not
just like the Bible says,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:10%
and that I believe that
there is, in a sense,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:10%
a grand plan in that those
energies were originally

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:10%
designed to help separate us,
to keep us separate from spirit,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:10%
from God, but not in a bad
way, but it's so that we

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:10%
can experience the other.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And so you need a
different energy in there

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
to make a separation between
source and the other.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.715 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that there's
a plan for all of that,

00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes that
the darkness is kind

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:90%
of like gone out of control.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like darkness gone
wild kind of thing.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.010 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of that, Bruce?

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well angels,
first of all, because they're

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:84%
from the God energy complex,
they can appear in an instant

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:90%
any time they want.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Now on the physical
level, if you

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.980 align:middle line:84%
want to deal with astrophysics,
they can go through a wormhole,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.440 align:middle line:84%
just like extraterrestrials
have come here

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:90%
going through a wormhole.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have to
travel the speed of light

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:90%
for a zillion years to be here.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Or they can go
through a stargate,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:84%
if you want to use
that term, too.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.440 align:middle line:90%
So yes, angels can appear here.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
the angel concept

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.240 align:middle line:84%
is that usually angels work
with large groups of people.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can have
a guardian angel.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But usually it's a spirit guide
that is much more frequent

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.353 align:middle line:90%
and around you statistically.

00:06:33.353 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For the individual.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.428 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: For the
individual, yes.

00:06:36.428 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Now let me show you
an example of how

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.463 align:middle line:90%
spirit guides can come back.

00:06:39.463 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So here's a patient of mine
I worked with years ago.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.588 align:middle line:90%
She was a photographer.

00:06:42.588 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
She was about 30 years old,
young, attractive woman.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And she goes into a past
life living in Utah in 1586.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.050 align:middle line:84%
In a Native American group,
she is a seer for the tribe.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But when she's not being a
seer in the physical body,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
she now becomes Blue Eagle,
a spirit guide for the tribe.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:84%
She speaks through
telepathy communication.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.190 align:middle line:84%
She sees into the
future as the seer.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And she sees the 21st century
with all the pollution,

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and wars, and all
the problems we have,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.190 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, was
very depressing for her.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
But the point was that she was
able to be a seer for her tribe

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as acting
as a spirit guide.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And her animal spirit
was a blue eagle.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.643 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example of a
past life regression that

00:07:25.643 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
served many-- by the
way, the end of the story

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:84%
is that after
working with her, she

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.790 align:middle line:84%
decided to give up her
photography business.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.680 align:middle line:84%
She went back to school and
now she's an acupuncturist.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doing what
she wants to do.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.638 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Which is a shamanic
discipline, energy healing.

00:07:38.638 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:84%
So you see how the
karmic indication

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:84%
of bringing her to
me and having her

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.965 align:middle line:84%
do her thing-- remember I do 1%
of the therapy, her higher self

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:90%
does 99%.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When
somebody comes to you,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.673 align:middle line:84%
do you know their outcome
before it even happens?

00:07:51.673 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: No, I
don't read them.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean technically I could
if I really wanted to,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:84%
but I don't want the patient
to develop co-dependency on me.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to come
across as a psychic.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I want them to be
psychically empowered

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:90%
and do it their own way.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But dealing with spirit guides,
let me give you another case

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
to show you-- a
very serious one--

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.280 align:middle line:84%
to show you how spirit guides
can actually work well.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.020 align:middle line:84%
This woman, I'll
call her Marissa--

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
not her real name--
she's 18 years old,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:90%
lives in Los Angeles.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And she's from a
very affluent family.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
When she goes to school,
she's made fun of,

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
because she's like a virgin,
very conservative, and very

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.213 align:middle line:90%
straight-laced.

00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:26.630 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't have any friends,
except for one friend Carla.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Carla is the opposite.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:90%
She's trying to corrupt her.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:34.038 align:middle line:84%
So one fine day, Carla's parents
has a home in Palm Springs.

00:08:34.038 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:90%
They went away for the weekend.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.828 align:middle line:90%
And Carla was there by herself.

00:08:36.828 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-oh, not good.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.445 align:middle line:90%
And how old is she?

00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Carla's
18, same age.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Troublemaker.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.782 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Troublemaker,
big troublemaker.

00:08:43.782 --> 00:08:45.757 align:middle line:84%
So she invites
Marissa to a party

00:08:45.757 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have on
a weekend, like a Sunday.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And Marissa doesn't
like parties,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
but she goes there's only
going to be 10 people there.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Well when Marissa shows
up, there's 150 people.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: There's drugs.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:90%
There's alcohol.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:90%
They're having sex.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.258 align:middle line:84%
They're doing all
kinds of creepy things.

00:08:58.258 --> 00:09:00.253 align:middle line:84%
So finally Carla
says, now you know,

00:09:00.253 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple of friends
of mine, Todd and James--

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:90%
as I call them.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:90%
Not their real names--

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.810 align:middle line:90%
and they have a present for you.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Marissa was a painter.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:84%
She was very
artistically involved.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So Carla supposedly was going to
give her a gift of some drawing

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:90%
that she got from some art fair.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And Todd and James were
going to give it to her.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So she figured,
well, that's normal.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:90%
She goes into the den.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
The guys lock the door and they
say we're going to rape you.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Now she's panicking.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.307 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't know what to do.

00:09:25.307 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:90%
They rip off her blouse.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Just then a pounding door,
somebody pounds at the door.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a cop.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.350 align:middle line:84%
He says, this is
the police, open up.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:34.618 align:middle line:90%
Everybody scampers away.

00:09:34.618 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine, OK, it's like
the mafia meeting here, right?

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.273 align:middle line:84%
So they're flushing the
drugs down the toilet.

00:09:39.273 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:84%
They're running out through
the back window and back door.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody complained.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: So the cop comes in.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Officer dressed her there.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.745 align:middle line:90%
And she looks at him.

00:09:45.745 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, ma'am
come here, I'm

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:90%
going to escort you to your car.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So she memorizes his name, his
badge number, and the patrol

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.645 align:middle line:90%
car number, right?

00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.377 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: She
goes into her car,

00:09:55.377 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:90%
drives home, a little shaken up.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Now after she arrives
home, a day or two later,

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:84%
she decides to call the police
department to thank him,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:90%
the officer.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:90%
And she gives him the name.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
They have no records of
the name of the officer.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:90%
There's no badge number.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:90%
There's no patrol car number.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And nobody was
sent to that house.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.340 align:middle line:90%
That was a spirit guide.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And clearly
there was somebody there.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:16.847 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:10:16.847 --> 00:10:18.305 align:middle line:84%
Spirit guide can
manifest himself--

00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:19.263 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shape shifted.

00:10:19.263 --> 00:10:20.763 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's
sort of like you're

00:10:20.763 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:84%
manifesting your astral
energy so that you

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.930 align:middle line:90%
can make himself solidified.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Like when you do bilocation,
these people who are out

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.110 align:middle line:84%
of body experiences, you can
magnify your astral body,

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.630 align:middle line:84%
make it so solid that people
can actually shake your hand

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.430 align:middle line:90%
and touch you.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think other
people see the spirit guide too

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.498 align:middle line:90%
or is it just the individual?

00:10:37.498 --> 00:10:39.665 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Anyone could
have seen the spirit guide.

00:10:39.665 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Now in your normal
form in an astral body,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:84%
let's say, you have to be
in a hypnotic level or very

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
psychically sensitive
to see them.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
But he was like as
physical as you and I,

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.938 align:middle line:84%
even though it was his
astral body condensed form.

00:10:52.938 --> 00:10:54.230 align:middle line:90%
The point is he saved the life.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.557 align:middle line:90%
Now the end of the story--

00:10:55.557 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:90%
I work with Marissa.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we found out
that he was a spirit guide.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.800 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years later,
she met Warren, got married.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
the proud parents

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:84%
of a son and daughter and having
a very nice, healthy, happy

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.825 align:middle line:84%
So you can see how spirit
guides can function.

00:11:11.825 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But here's another
example of a chemist guide

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.950 align:middle line:90%
that I want to report.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:90%
This woman, I call her Eileen.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.730 align:middle line:84%
She was in the hospital
for pancreatic cancer.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Now pancreatic cancer--

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the worst.

00:11:20.565 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: No, no, actually
lung cancer is number one.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Colon cancer is number two.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Pancreatic is number three.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
good, regardless.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's a high
mortality rate, trust me.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.140 align:middle line:84%
That's what killed
Patrick Swayze, the actor.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So she's
in the hospital.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling her, look,
there's nothing we can do.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.648 align:middle line:84%
We're just going
to wrap things up.

00:11:34.648 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Go on around the world cruise.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Enjoy your life
for whatever days you have.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So she's
getting ready to leave.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile a young
resident comes in.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
He's about 32, 33 years old,
tall guy, piercing blue eyes.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hendricks is his
label on his jacket,

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:90%
on his medical jacket.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:84%
He says, ma'am, I have to
do a quick test here for you

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.013 align:middle line:90%
before you leave.

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well, I
wasn't informed of that.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.030 align:middle line:84%
He says, it won't
take much time.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.850 align:middle line:84%
He goes into his pocket,
pulls out a pen flashlight,

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
shines a blue-green laser
beam on her pancreatic tissue,

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:84%
on her stomach, or her
area on her abdomen.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:90%
And then he puts the pen away.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, what is this?

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:90%
He just looks at her and smiles.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:90%
And he leaves.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:90%
So now she goes home.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:84%
The oncologist calls
her up and says, ma'am,

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:90%
we have a problem here.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to come
back to the hospital.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.800 align:middle line:84%
The lab tests that we did
on you show no cancer.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
There is obviously a mistake,
so I have to run the test again.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We got to test her.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.028 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: She goes
back, runs the test.

00:12:31.028 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:90%
No cancer.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now she also said
what about that young intern?

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:90%
What did he do?

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.275 align:middle line:90%
He goes what intern?

00:12:38.275 --> 00:12:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Hendricks doesn't exit.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
no Dr. Hendricks.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And nobody was
sent to her room that day.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That's
the spirit guide.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.755 align:middle line:90%
Now you can say it's an angel.

00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:90%
But that was 20 years ago.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.230 align:middle line:90%
She's still alive, by the way.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.902 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it God
that does this?

00:12:51.902 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yeah, indirectly.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:90%
It's actually the higher self.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:54.910 align:middle line:90%
You have to understand.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
The higher self is a remnant
of the God energy complex,

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:90%
almost like an angel.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the perfect
part of our soul.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we eventually
ascend, you're

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
going to merge with your
higher self and become one.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And now your perfect
energy, which

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:84%
gives you the option
of staying here

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.600 align:middle line:84%
as a spirit guide like a Buddha
or going back to the higher

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%
plane to rejoin the God
energy complex from whence

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:90%
we came originally.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On Gaia's
"Inspiration,"

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Sonia Choquette explains how
our spirit guides can help us.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:10%
- You have to listen to
them and let them in though.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:10%
So step one, ask.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:24.460 align:middle line:10%
- Absolutely

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:10%
- Step one, ask.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.585 align:middle line:10%
- Number one, you
have to be open.

00:13:27.585 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:84%
That's like turning
the radio on.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the first step.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Be open to that I have help.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Step two, expect it.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:90%
That's a big step.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.800 align:middle line:90%
I always expect to be helped.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's my big mission.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:90%
- That's a big one.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.498 align:middle line:90%
That's a leap of faith.

00:13:46.498 --> 00:13:48.010 align:middle line:90%
- I've got to change that one.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Expect to be helped.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Third-- this is another big
one-- trust what you get.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Trust when the guides
are helping you.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever
think, that's strange.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.190 align:middle line:90%
God, how did that happen?

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:90%
That was weird.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:90%
That was a guide.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Well that was synchronistic.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:90%
That was a guide.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh that was a fun accident.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.770 align:middle line:90%
That was a guide.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So give it up and
acknowledge that.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:90%
So I live in a different world.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:10%
Einstein said, you can
live in two dimensions--

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:10%
either nothing is a miracle
or everything's a miracle.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:10%
So I choose the door that's
everything's a miracle.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:10%
And if you would choose that
door and ask for your guides,

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:10%
they show up.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:10%
And it's crazy in how many ways.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You agree
with her, Bruce?

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Sure.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to understand
something about spirit guides.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of
things to consider.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.650 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they're
here to assist us.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:84%
They're not here to
control your life.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:90%
You can ignore them.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:42.640 align:middle line:90%
You can test them.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they encourage
you to test them

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:90%
to show you that they're real.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to
separate them from lower--

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think it
would be wise to ignore them.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Would it be?

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Well people do that.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people don't
want to really be helped.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:90%
They get into that mentality.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
But spirit guides will give you
advice about how to help you.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:90%
They can arrange opportunities.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:90%
They're always going to be--

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.060 align:middle line:84%
an emotional
experience with they

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:84%
will always be one
of love and kindness.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:05.260 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:90%
So those are spirit guides.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Now let's separate that
from lower astral entities.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Because my practice
focuses on healing,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
when I'm bringing
in spirit guides,

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing this for the purpose
of training the patient

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:90%
to heal themselves.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Remember they do 99%
of the work, I do 1%.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:84%
But the higher self and the
spirit guides are involved.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You motivate them.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So anyway, so now
people will say, well, gee,

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%
doctor I contacted this or I
had the spirit guide contact

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:90%
and I want to share it with you.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Now they tell me the story.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:90%
So I want to separate.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're dealing with
a lower astral entity,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.550 align:middle line:90%
they can read your mind.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So they know
everything about you.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.520 align:middle line:90%
They can try to scam you.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:90%
But this is what they can't do.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.390 align:middle line:84%
They can't create feelings
of unconditional love.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.673 align:middle line:84%
All they can create is
feelings of anxiety.

00:15:42.673 --> 00:15:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And plus they do a lot of things
that a spirit guide would never

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:84%
They're very foul
languaged towards God.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.073 align:middle line:90%
They try to manipulate you.

00:15:50.073 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The spirit guides are?

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No, no.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Low astrals.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The low astrals.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I'm
trying to separate so

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
when people get what
they think is a guide,

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.860 align:middle line:84%
but it's really a low astral
to keep away from them.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They also
try to control you.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:90%
You'll have bad luck.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.920 align:middle line:90%
You'll have nightmares.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.990 align:middle line:84%
You'll have all
kinds of problems.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes red glittery
appearance in the eyes

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.860 align:middle line:84%
shows as the lower astral,
either you or somebody close

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So everything is based on
negativity and bad luck.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.445 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the spirit
guide is the opposite.

00:16:16.445 --> 00:16:18.320 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
good luck, good fortune.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:90%
You can meet a soulmate.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Your business will expand.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Your relationship with
your family will improve.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So you want to separate the
spirit guide from the lower

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.320 align:middle line:90%
astral.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.528 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want those
spirit guards all around you.

00:16:29.528 --> 00:16:30.328 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:16:30.328 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:84%
With a lower
astral, you can just

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.470 align:middle line:90%
say, bug off, get away from me.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:34.500 align:middle line:90%
And they will leave.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Because if they
fail with you, they

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:84%
get beaten up on the
lower astral plane.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's no incentive
to deal with people

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:90%
that are spiritually evolved.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they will move
on to the next poor person.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.183 align:middle line:84%
There's 7.4 billion
people on this planet.

00:16:45.183 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of
people to choose from.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
The point is that
you want to always

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:90%
be psychically protected.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.985 align:middle line:84%
When I work with
my patients, train

00:16:50.985 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:84%
them to connect with
their higher self,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm obviously doing protection
techniques, higher chakras

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.920 align:middle line:84%
link, and other
techniques to help

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:84%
them to deal with only spirit
guides and positive entities

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.810 align:middle line:90%
when they're not with me.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're using the spirit
guides as a form of healer

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:84%
and an adjunct to
their higher self.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've talked in the
past about the Akashic records.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Do spirit guides
read your records?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.045 align:middle line:90%
Do they know all about you?

00:17:15.045 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The spirit
guides, not only

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:84%
do they know all about you, but
very often your spirit guides

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
have been with
you in past lives.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:84%
Very often the spirit guide
will present themselves

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
in clothing of a couple
of years ago because that

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.145 align:middle line:90%
was their favorite past life.

00:17:27.145 --> 00:17:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So you've had a
karmic connection

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of these
spirit guides.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.328 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, they can read
your Akashic records

00:17:32.328 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:90%
but they don't like to do that.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.203 align:middle line:90%
They want to empower you.

00:17:35.203 --> 00:17:36.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
to just give you--

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.060 align:middle line:84%
they want you to
learn how to fish

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:84%
rather than giving you
free fish, so to speak.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So they will train you
how to be more psychic.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, I mentioned
the messenger guide

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
is the one that helps you
develop your psychic abilities.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:84%
This would be accessing
the Akashic records,

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:84%
or developing
telepathy, or regression

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.950 align:middle line:90%
progressions, et cetera.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So they want you to learn
how to do it yourself

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:90%
so you're not codependent.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:84%
The last thing a spirit
guide wants to do

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
is to make you
codependent on them

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.228 align:middle line:90%
or to have you worship them.

00:18:04.228 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:90%
And the same with angels.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:84%
They don't want you to
worship them either.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
They just want you to
grow spiritually and help

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.950 align:middle line:90%
others around you.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is it to
have access to your past life?

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well it's
really not that important.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:84%
What's important is to have
access to your karmic purpose.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.460 align:middle line:84%
You see if you review
your past lives, that's

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:84%
like watching the
History Channel.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.243 align:middle line:84%
But you're really not going
to learn that much from them

00:18:27.243 --> 00:18:29.120 align:middle line:84%
because the technology
today is so different.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%
What's really important
is to access your higher

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.500 align:middle line:84%
self to raise the quality
of your soul's level--

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
we call this the frequency
vibrational rate--

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.950 align:middle line:84%
to become more spiritual,
more psychically empowered,

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and to remove the one
thing that keeps you

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.140 align:middle line:84%
in the karmic cycle,
which is fear.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Everything I deal with--

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fear does that.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.643 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --deals with
resolving and eliminating

00:18:47.643 --> 00:18:50.750 align:middle line:84%
or reducing as much as possible
to the eventual elimination

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:90%
of the fear.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spirit guides,
do we have the same ones

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.330 align:middle line:90%
all the time?

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.913 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: No, as
I mentioned before,

00:18:56.913 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:10%
you have an inner
band of spirit guides.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And let's say you have
them for a couple of years

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and now all of a sudden
you made an epiphany,

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:84%
you made a major breakthrough,
as I use that term

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.250 align:middle line:90%
with energy in my practice.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And now these guides are
no longer relevant to you.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.855 align:middle line:84%
So now you move up
to the next level

00:19:12.855 --> 00:19:15.480 align:middle line:84%
just like going from high school
to college to graduate school,

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So you have a different
band of spirit guides

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.410 align:middle line:84%
all dispatched and negotiated
by your higher self.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self brings
you the guides to you.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Now what I do is I
train patients to go

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:90%
to what I call a sanctuary.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:10%
This is like a conference
room in the fifth dimension

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:10%
on the upper astral plane.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:10%
You meet with your higher self.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:10%
The higher self
evaluates you and says,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.580 align:middle line:10%
OK, you need an abundance
guide, or a relationship guide,

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:10%
or a chemist guide.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And then it brings in the
various spirit guides.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.873 align:middle line:84%
And I help the patient
to do that, you see,

00:19:43.873 --> 00:19:46.040 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, deals
with the healing of whatever

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:84%
issues they have that
they approached me

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:90%
with in the first place.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's all based upon
using the spirit guide

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:84%
as an adjunct to the
higher self to help

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:84%
you to be all you can be and to
raise the frequency vibrational

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:90%
rate of your soul's energy.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had
a patient with you when

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.390 align:middle line:90%
their spirit guide shows up?

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.758 align:middle line:84%
And then how do you know
that it's happening?

00:20:07.758 --> 00:20:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: They usually don't.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:84%
No, they don't show up while
they're in session with me.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
They can access them and
communicate with them.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.770 align:middle line:84%
But I don't see them
physically appear

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:84%
or they don't come in
there is like a hologram.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.350 align:middle line:84%
They will be able to
communicate with them

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:90%
on the upper astral plane.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And they can even
get some advice then,

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.920 align:middle line:84%
but usually the advice is given
to them in the dream levels

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
disturb their life.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll have
a cognitive insight

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day like,
Oh, maybe I should go there.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.260 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't thinking of doing that.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's the synchronicity.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.720 align:middle line:90%
That's how they function.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:84%
They want it to be
synchronistic and a part

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.760 align:middle line:84%
of your life rather than you
being obsessed with them.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if they did that
the other way, people would

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
be obsessed and
saying, OK, I'm just

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:90%
waiting for my spirit guide.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And that would interfere
with your life.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:90%
And they don't want to do that.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.773 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
that the spirit guide has

00:20:53.773 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:90%
entered that person's life?

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, you
can see the changes.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: When you see
changes like in Marissa's case--

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:84%
the one I told you
about the 18-year-old

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.310 align:middle line:84%
who went to Palm Springs
for that particular party.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.440 align:middle line:84%
When I worked with
her, she was depressed.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.700 align:middle line:90%
She had insomnia.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.452 align:middle line:90%
She was very shy.

00:21:09.452 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:84%
She had a lot of
self-image issues.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And then she blossomed as a very
empowered and very psychically

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:90%
empowered young lady.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
she met Warren

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and got married and
has two children now.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So her personality
changed dramatically.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:90%
This is a 180-degree shift.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: It is.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.515 align:middle line:84%
Not because of me, I'm
1%, because of the 99%.

00:21:29.515 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You draw
it out of them.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:31.745 align:middle line:90%
You get it out of them.

00:21:31.745 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yeah,
it's sort of like

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.475 align:middle line:84%
because of my dental
background I extract it.

00:21:34.475 --> 00:21:35.275 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:21:35.275 --> 00:21:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I like that.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Without the novocaine.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Without
the blood, too.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spirit
guides, when we look

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.690 align:middle line:84%
at our past lives and
our parallel lives,

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:84%
are they always good
things or sometimes bad?

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.182 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: No, actually, one
of the reasons why I don't like

00:21:49.182 --> 00:21:51.740 align:middle line:84%
to review past lives a whole
lot because people say, look,

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.040 align:middle line:90%
doctor--

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You like future lives.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, let's
talk about the past first.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So let's
say you have a problem.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.765 align:middle line:84%
You want to go to the past
life to see the problem.

00:21:57.765 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have a
lousy ending to that life.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:84%
The origin of
somebody who is afraid

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:84%
of water probably drowned in a
past life or some relationship

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.790 align:middle line:90%
issue.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Somebody murdered them
or abandoned them.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's not a lot of fun.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Now the future is different
because the future is plastic.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:90%
You can change it.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And you can, for
example, the famous case

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with you on the radio
about, Tammy, this woman,

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.220 align:middle line:84%
July 17, 1996, she was going
to go on TWA flight 800.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But I worked
with her prior to that.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:84%
She proceeded with
the trip to Paris.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.297 align:middle line:84%
And she said I'm not
going on that flight.

00:22:26.297 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:90%
I said change your flight.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:84%
She would have been
231 on the death level.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So that was going into an
age progression in this life,

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.790 align:middle line:84%
but you can also go
into future life.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.262 align:middle line:84%
Like your Dexter Monterey

>>NOORY: The future
talk show host.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: That's right.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.495 align:middle line:84%

jumpsuit, and your hologram.

00:22:41.495 --> 00:22:42.703 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And my high ratings.

00:22:42.703 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And your

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Nice ratings.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So my point is that,
look, one of the things

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I do for the benefit
of your viewers,

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I do a monthly podcast
now, the second Sunday

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.350 align:middle line:84%
of the month where I
cover a different topic.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And I do a group hypnosis
at the same time.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:90%
So they can benefit from that.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:84%
They can also go and check
out my YouTube channel

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.973 align:middle line:84%
and see actual clips
of what they can do.

00:23:03.973 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:84%
You can see patients
who have gone

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.640 align:middle line:90%
through different experiences.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And I teach them how
to do this themselves

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:84%
so they can be instructed
in the art of self-hypnosis.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And they can rise
above it and not

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.620 align:middle line:84%
be dependent on
me or anyone else.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the purpose of this
is short-term self-directed

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:84%
therapy so that people can
go on with their lives,

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
spiritually grow,
empower themselves.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:90%
And remember, get rid of fear.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:90%
That's a biggie.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.110 align:middle line:84%
That keeps you in
the karmic cycle.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That holds
you back, doesn't it?

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well it
causes all the problems.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:84%
There's only two
emotions in the universe.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:32.730 align:middle line:90%
You think of it.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Fear causes all the problems.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Unconditional love
leads to ascension.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:84%
You want to always go
to unconditional love.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well these spirit
guides that we have,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.143 align:middle line:84%
is there an advantage
to having one?

00:23:43.143 --> 00:23:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well you
have more than one.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.240 align:middle line:84%
You have like a
dozen at one time.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:46.590 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is--

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The more the merrier?

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's
like, let's say,

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
invest in something.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.028 align:middle line:84%
You want a financial
advisor or an attorney

00:23:53.028 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:90%
to help you with the contracts.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:84%
You have people who
advise you on things

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:90%
that you don't know much about.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.207 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit
guides, because they

00:23:59.207 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:84%
are in the fifth dimension
they can perceive

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.100 align:middle line:84%
our past, present, and future,
and even parallel lives,

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.975 align:middle line:90%
they can advise us.

00:24:04.975 --> 00:24:06.350 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to control you,

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:84%
but they can say, maybe, you
should take a different path

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:90%
and consider this.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.620 align:middle line:84%
They're just giving
you a consider.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.680 align:middle line:90%
You make the decision.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:90%
You have free will.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.240 align:middle line:90%
You always have free will.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.660 align:middle line:84%
You can always reject what
spirit guides advise you.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.270 align:middle line:84%
That is not a good concept,
because these spirit guides

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.100 align:middle line:90%
are really very well trained.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:90%
And yes, there is a hierarchy.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
better than others.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.020 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going to get into
trouble with the spirit guide

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:90%
content.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Whereas you would get in trouble
with a lower astral entity.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm trying to show
you how you can differentiate.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Whenever an entity appears
and you feel uncomfortable,

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:90%
move on.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.950 align:middle line:90%
That is a lower astral.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.170 align:middle line:84%
If you feel
unconditional love, you

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:84%
feel spiritual, you
feel very positive,

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with either
a spirit guide, an angel,

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.230 align:middle line:90%
or your higher self, either one.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.098 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the spirit guides
help us out of our fears?

00:24:54.098 --> 00:24:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes,
that is their point.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:84%
What they're trying
to do is they're

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:84%
trying to train you to
connect with the higher self

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.950 align:middle line:84%
to raise the soul's
energy to a higher level.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I call this a
major breakthrough.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.647 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, then
you have absolutely no fears.

00:25:07.647 --> 00:25:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you're doing
that, now you're

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:90%
on the path to ascension.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:84%

250,000 years, how do you know?

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:90%
- Right?

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Is there a guy standing
there with a big clock?

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.460 align:middle line:84%
- Or a book that says this is
what happens 250,00 years ago.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.750 align:middle line:10%
And you're like
that's where I was?

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:10%
- No.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:84%
My guides tell me where we are
and what the time period is.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:10%
- And they say this is--
and what did you see?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:10%
- Well I mean the whole
landscape is different.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And everything has a
different look to it.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:10%
Where it was once desert,
it's green and lush.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about a time period

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.370 align:middle line:84%
where giants really
did walk the earth.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of that perception
of seeing that particular time

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.240 align:middle line:90%
is intimidating.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:10%
I remember standing
with my guides

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:10%
and hiding because
I was so intimidated

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:10%
by what I was seeing.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:10%
Giants.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:10%
- So the foliage was
larger, the beings.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:10%
Was this around dinosaurs
or way before that?

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.160 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah, yeah, before.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:26.960 align:middle line:10%
- Before that.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:10%
- And it was lush
and full of foliage.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.530 align:middle line:90%
And you felt small?

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:36.930 align:middle line:90%
- Very, very small and scared.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.820 align:middle line:10%
- In a totally unfamiliar land.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:10%
And did you ever go to other
planets, not just this one?

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.990 align:middle line:10%
- Yes.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:10%
Many times.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:10%
I've been to Pleiades, and
Orion, and a few other places.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.140 align:middle line:10%
The most amazing
thing that I feel

00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:01.930 align:middle line:10%
has come to me as a spirit
traveler is that humans

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:10%
were brought to Earth.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:84%
They came to Earth
20 million years ago.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.350 align:middle line:90%
- Brought to Earth?

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.390 align:middle line:90%
- Well they came in a ship.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So the ship-- yes,
somebody flew the ship.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:14.110 align:middle line:10%
They were brought in.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:17.020 align:middle line:10%
Humans are as much
extraterrestrial

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.200 align:middle line:10%
as extraterrestrials.

They're not going
to give up on you.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.098 align:middle line:90%
You can just ignore them.

00:27:29.098 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:84%
By the way in
reference to that clip,

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
remember you had Atlantis
and Lemuria going back

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:90%
a couple of 100,000 years.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you had other
civilizations, the Hyperborean

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and Polarian, and these
go back millions of years.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.780 align:middle line:84%
The Scandinavians talk about
their Valkyrian, their gods,

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:90%
from ancient times.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're talking about.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.970 align:middle line:10%
But basically you understand
the spirit guides will never

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.470 align:middle line:10%
push anything on you.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:51.400 align:middle line:90%
They advise you.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:84%
If you reject them
and just ignore them,

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.970 align:middle line:90%
they will come back.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.935 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self
will help negotiate.

00:27:56.935 --> 00:27:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going
to be much more likely.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.377 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
always say test them.

00:28:00.377 --> 00:28:01.960 align:middle line:84%
They want you to
test them to show you

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:84%
that they're not a lower astral,
that they're here for you.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you test them
and they pass their test,

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:84%
then you're more
likely to trust them.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know you've
connected with a spirit guide?

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:12.988 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well
number one, you're

00:28:12.988 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:84%
going to get to feelings
of love versus fear.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, whatever
advice they give you,

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.320 align:middle line:84%
if you test them on a small
level, it will work out.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:90%
It will come true.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And it will help you
rather than hinder you.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So now you're dealing
with what's the odds?

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:84%
When I see my patients,
a lot of times

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.550 align:middle line:84%
they have really
uncomfortable lives.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.500 align:middle line:84%
They had a lot of
failures, frustrated.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:32.790 align:middle line:90%
They're depressed.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you
wouldn't be seeing them

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:90%
for crying out loud.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
remember, America's

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:84%
the most depressed
country in the world.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.840 align:middle line:84%
We're the richest,
most powerful.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.132 align:middle line:90%
We're still the most depressed.

00:28:39.132 --> 00:28:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So when they start
making inroads

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:43.270 align:middle line:84%
into that then all
of a sudden they're

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:45.850 align:middle line:84%
starting to get less and less
depressed, more confident, more

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:48.880 align:middle line:84%
positive, because of the
interaction of their higher

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.880 align:middle line:84%
self and then the spirit guides,
now they're a happy camper.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
starting to be much more

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:84%
trusting towards the spirit
guides, and they make changes.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I see dramatic changes
in my practice all the time.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean I see it like every
day, or every week anyway

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:90%
in my practice.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
thing that keeps me

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.490 align:middle line:84%
very positively motivated and
empowered with this practice.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
got into dentistry,

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, did you ever think
you'd be doing this?

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: No, I had a
very complicated epiphany

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.772 align:middle line:84%
which I describe in my "Past
Lives Future Lives Reveal"

00:29:18.772 --> 00:29:19.572 align:middle line:90%
book.

00:29:19.572 --> 00:29:20.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a long story.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:22.118 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say
that there were things

00:29:22.118 --> 00:29:25.000 align:middle line:84%
that my higher self
and spirit guides

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:84%
got me to orient or
reorient my life to become

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.460 align:middle line:84%
more of the past life therapist,
progression therapist, energy

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:84%
healer rather than
just a dentist.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.562 align:middle line:90%
So it's a long story.

00:29:37.562 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
bore you with that.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say that
I had my own epiphany,

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.608 align:middle line:84%
because when I was in
dental school there

00:29:42.608 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:84%
was no way in God's green Earth
that I would be assuming that I

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.350 align:middle line:84%
would be doing this
and working with you

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.628 align:middle line:84%
or doing the kind
of practice I have.

00:29:49.628 --> 00:29:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I would have thought I would
be a dentist for 40 years.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:84%
But thank goodness my
career path has changed

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.710 align:middle line:90%
after 13 years of dentistry.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this for
a real long time, decades.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: And this is my love.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And my patients,
they appreciate me.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And I appreciate them.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.550 align:middle line:90%
And I appreciate you.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're glad
you took this path.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:09.405 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yeah.

00:30:09.405 --> 00:30:11.843 align:middle line:84%
This was the yellow brick
road, as they would say, OK?

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:14.260 align:middle line:84%
By the way, let me give you
an example, a very famous one,

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:90%
of spirit guide contact--

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.390 align:middle line:84%
the author Robert
Louis Stevenson.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: When he was a kid,
a child, he had nightmares.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And he had these
little spirit guides

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:84%
called Brownies that
came into his life that

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.410 align:middle line:90%
helped overcome the nightmares.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Then when he was an adult,
these Brownies-- because he

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.970 align:middle line:84%
was very insecure
about his writing,

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:34.510 align:middle line:84%
these Brownies gave
him the inspiration

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:84%
to write "The Strange Case
of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde,"

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.330 align:middle line:84%
which is what he's
most known for.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:42.730 align:middle line:84%
That was his Brownies,
spirit guides,

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.100 align:middle line:84%
they were little creatures
that came across there.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.720 align:middle line:84%
They can manifest
any way they want.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
By the way, spirit guide can
manifest as a colored light.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.950 align:middle line:90%
It can be a white light.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.150 align:middle line:90%
It can be the rainbow colors.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:56.630 align:middle line:84%
It can be anything to help
you to feel comfortable.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Some people like the
religious figures--

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:02.120 align:middle line:84%
a Buddha, Muhammad, or
Jesus, or Moses, or whatever.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.262 align:middle line:84%
Anything that will make
you feel comfortable,

00:31:05.262 --> 00:31:07.470 align:middle line:84%
because remember they can
read your mind so they know

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.180 align:middle line:84%
what you like and
what you are going

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.680 align:middle line:90%
to be more comfortable with.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And therefore they will try to
make you more adjusted and more

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:84%
open-minded in reference to
their assistance, because they

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.210 align:middle line:90%
want to help You

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they like to help
a lot with health issues?

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yeah, well we
have talked about the chemist

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.900 align:middle line:84%
guides as an example, the case
of the hospital with Eileen

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.790 align:middle line:84%
with the pancreatic
cancer, for example.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But even lower cases, very
simple issues-- allergies,

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:84%
irritable bowel syndrome,
chronic fatigue, anemia issues.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Any of the biochemical issues
that are around, these chemist

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.980 align:middle line:84%
guides, these are
the chemist ones,

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.438 align:middle line:84%
they're the ones
that can help you.

00:31:42.438 --> 00:31:44.130 align:middle line:84%
The doctor one is the
one that helps you

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.005 align:middle line:84%
with the mental and
emotional issues and even

00:31:46.005 --> 00:31:47.070 align:middle line:90%
some spiritual issues.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So those two are
very popular guides

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.330 align:middle line:84%
that usually are part of an
inner band of spirit guides

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:52.260 align:middle line:90%
that work with people.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What percent do you
think people heed the advice

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:57.480 align:middle line:90%
or don't take it?

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.938 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I don't
have any stats.

00:31:58.938 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you my patients, OK?

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would think most
of yours heed your advice.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: My patients are not
a statistically representative

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.470 align:middle line:84%
sample, because they're
obviously highly motivated--

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because of you.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well the Gaia, your
audience, when they come to me,

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of your Gaia
viewers come to me.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.360 align:middle line:84%
They are very highly
motivated, much

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.688 align:middle line:90%
more spiritually sophisticated.

00:32:13.688 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sharp as a tack.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.522 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And they
have better attitudes.

00:32:16.522 --> 00:32:19.020 align:middle line:84%
The average person is
very cynical and depressed

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.290 align:middle line:90%
in America today.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.940 align:middle line:10%
So I think a lot of them would
ignore their spirit guides

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.160 align:middle line:10%
unless they went through
some sort of an epiphany

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.330 align:middle line:10%
or something happened.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So shows like this
will help educate them

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.020 align:middle line:84%
as to why they should
listen to them,

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.190 align:middle line:84%
test them, and see how good
they are, and then continue

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.230 align:middle line:84%
working with them to
benefit their lives.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.813 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've
been doing this,

00:32:38.813 --> 00:32:40.935 align:middle line:84%
do you have your own
spirit guides personally?

00:32:40.935 --> 00:32:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yeah.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have
they done for you?

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:44.573 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well
they've introduced me

00:32:44.573 --> 00:32:45.540 align:middle line:90%
to you, number one.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.218 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well that was magical.

00:32:47.218 --> 00:32:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Remember--
a quick story.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.683 align:middle line:84%
So in the old days,
back in the '90s,

00:32:50.683 --> 00:32:53.100 align:middle line:84%
I would be interviewing with
Art Bell on "Coast to Coast,"

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:53.900 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.200 align:middle line:90%
And then he retired.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And then so I was interviewing
with some of the subhosts--

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, Mike Siegel.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yeah.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And the woman from
the San Francisco--

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Barbara Simpson?

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.647 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Barbara Simpson.

00:33:04.647 --> 00:33:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I said to
myself, you know

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:84%
what I'd really like
to do is I'd really

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.580 align:middle line:84%
like to have a regular permanent
host that I can work with.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean not that I didn't--

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.288 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any
problems with it,

00:33:14.288 --> 00:33:16.270 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted to have
the regular host.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, OK,
higher self, fix it up.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing
I know, Lisa Lyons

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.355 align:middle line:84%
from the network
from Oregon calls me

00:33:23.355 --> 00:33:25.772 align:middle line:84%
and she goes, I'm going to
hook you up with George Noory.

00:33:25.772 --> 00:33:27.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who you
were in those days.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't familiar with
the St. Louis experience.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I came from
a local station.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: THE NIGHTHAWK remember?

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: THE NIGHTHAWK.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.530 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know who you were then.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I don't usually know
hosts unless I work with them.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.175 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, there's
like 10,000 hosts here.

00:33:38.175 --> 00:33:40.010 align:middle line:90%
So I said who is this George?

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.890 align:middle line:84%
She goes I think you're
going to like him.

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Well guess what?

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, we like each other.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.780 align:middle line:84%
But the spirit
guides, I think was

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.077 align:middle line:84%
the one that stimulated
her to hook me up with you.

00:33:48.077 --> 00:33:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To hook you up with me.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.030 align:middle line:90%
And we clicked from the get-go.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: 18 years.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:52.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.692 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember
those first shows.

00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.984 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You know what
you did that was interesting?

00:33:55.984 --> 00:33:58.860 align:middle line:84%
In 2011, I was in Bangalore,
India, doing a workshop.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And you had me on
"Coast to Coast."

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.830 align:middle line:90%
They're 12 and 1/2 hours ahead.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.360 align:middle line:90%
So we did a little quick phone--

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:03.680 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.805 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: I was in India.

00:34:04.805 --> 00:34:06.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was really fun workshop.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Those workshops are
on my YouTube channel.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.477 align:middle line:90%
They can actually see.

00:34:09.477 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:90%
It's really fun.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can see all
these-- like there was

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:90%
900 people in this audience.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.719 align:middle line:84%
They were all
extremely motivated.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.179 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also dealing with
things like Rama Empire

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:21.025 align:middle line:84%
and things that relate
to ancient Hindu history.

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:21.900 align:middle line:90%
They can learn a lot.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And I like to educate
people to show them

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.409 align:middle line:90%
that knowledge is power.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:90%
It always is.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
people have in fear

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.679 align:middle line:84%
is because they don't
have the knowledge

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and they're scared of either
the media brainwashing,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.400 align:middle line:84%
or the negativity of society, or
energy vampires in their life.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to help them
to rise above that so they

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:42.920 align:middle line:84%
can be more
spiritually empowered,

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.475 align:middle line:90%
or I call psychically empowered.

00:34:44.475 --> 00:34:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about some of your cases.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.632 align:middle line:84%
What is the Christmas
angel in uniform story?

00:34:48.632 --> 00:34:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well that was the
story of Marissa, the one who

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.199 align:middle line:90%
went to Palm Springs.

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:54.588 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That
Sunday, that party

00:34:54.588 --> 00:34:57.570 align:middle line:84%
was actually right during
the Christmas holidays.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.700 align:middle line:90%
So that was the Christmas angel.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
the Hollywood angel?

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well this
is different now.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.947 align:middle line:84%
So there's a man, I'll call
him Sam, not his real name.

00:35:04.947 --> 00:35:06.030 align:middle line:90%
And he lives in Hollywood.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:08.595 align:middle line:84%
Now you know Hollywood is
not a very nice neighborhood.

00:35:08.595 --> 00:35:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a tough area.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.872 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Drug dealers,
crimes there like crazy.

00:35:11.872 --> 00:35:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like an
inner city within itself.

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Sam was a
very low income person.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And he was living in an
apartment in a really bad area

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:90%
off of Hollywood Boulevard.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And he used to go to
a convenience store

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.750 align:middle line:90%
to get his food shopping--

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: His day-to-day stuff.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.875 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --sandwiches,
munchies, whatever.

00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So he's going back
to his apartment

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.540 align:middle line:90%
from the convenience store.

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Walking?

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Walking.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.450 align:middle line:90%
He had no car.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are three muggers
that come up to him.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.437 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, poor guy.

00:35:36.437 --> 00:35:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And they
say, come over here.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.390 align:middle line:90%
And now he's in an alley.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Not good.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't go.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: One
pulls out a knife.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.883 align:middle line:84%
This is like "Crocodile Dundee"
kind of knife, big knife.

00:35:45.883 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big one, Jim Bowie.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: He said
let me get your wallet

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
hurt you real badly.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.115 align:middle line:90%
So now Sam is panicking.

00:35:53.115 --> 00:35:54.240 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know what to do.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.760 align:middle line:84%
The next thing he knows
right in front of them,

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.230 align:middle line:84%
a human being appears
out of nowhere.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.160 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: OK, 6 foot,
6 and 1/2 feet tall guy.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:90%
And he looks at the muggers.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:07.340 align:middle line:84%
They freeze,
suspended animation.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.220 align:middle line:90%
And he says, go home.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.477 align:middle line:84%
Sam runs as fast as he could
to get to his apartment.

00:36:11.477 --> 00:36:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Looks around,
the guys are still frozen.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:15.535 align:middle line:90%
The spirit guide disappears.

00:36:15.535 --> 00:36:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You mean like this?

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.140 align:middle line:90%
Locked like that?

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Like this.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.660 align:middle line:90%
"Men in Black" time, you know?

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit guide,
which I assume it was,

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.250 align:middle line:84%
disappeared right
before his eyes.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And those guys were
still like this.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:26.590 align:middle line:90%
And he just ran away.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.740 align:middle line:90%
And he obviously was saved.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.170 align:middle line:90%
So that was in Hollywood.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:84%
A lot of bad things
happen in Hollywood.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.320 align:middle line:90%
That was the Hollywood angel.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:90%
I eventually worked with him.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.668 align:middle line:90%
He came to a workshop of mine.

00:36:34.668 --> 00:36:35.710 align:middle line:90%
And he told me the story.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
relate that to you.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a famous one
about an actor, Gordon MacRae.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know if
you know who he is.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah,
I remember him.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.347 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: He was a
song and dance guy.

00:36:43.347 --> 00:36:45.310 align:middle line:84%
He was in "Carousel,"
"South Pacific," right?

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And he was in the Army Air
Corps right after World War II.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.320 align:middle line:90%
And he was a pilot.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.210 align:middle line:90%
And the co-pilot had--

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.982 align:middle line:90%
apparently, they were flying.

00:36:53.982 --> 00:36:54.940 align:middle line:90%
And there was problems.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And he froze, he just panicked--
not Gordon, but the co-pilot.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.930 align:middle line:84%
His hands were on the controls
and the plane was diving.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stuck like
he was glued to it.

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The airport control
tower people please, please you

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.360 align:middle line:90%
guys got to jump.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.320 align:middle line:90%
You guys can't do this.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: So Gordon said, no.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.870 align:middle line:90%
One of the guys jumped.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And because the altitude
was too low, he died.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Gordon used his--

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Gordon was a strong guy.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.530 align:middle line:84%
He peeled off the guy's
hand from the controls,

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:21.820 align:middle line:90%
pulled the thing back.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And he and his two other
buddies, whatever, was saved.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He landed
the plane safely.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But he
was instructed not

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.713 align:middle line:90%
to jump by the spirit guide.

00:37:29.713 --> 00:37:30.880 align:middle line:90%
See that was the difference.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He would
have been dead.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: He would
have been dead.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.450 align:middle line:84%
By the way, Gordon's
daughter Meredith MacRae

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:37.697 align:middle line:84%
used to do a show on
Channel 9 in Los Angeles.

00:37:37.697 --> 00:37:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And I had the pleasure
of interviewing

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.020 align:middle line:90%
with her back in the '80s.

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So her family tree
carried on here.

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is or
was William Blake?

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well William Blake
was a writer and poet in the--

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.060 align:middle line:90%
1757 to 1827 was his years.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:56.470 align:middle line:84%
He did these copper
engravings, beautiful books

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.490 align:middle line:90%
that were illustrated.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:01.030 align:middle line:84%
He contacted his
late brother Robert.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.530 align:middle line:84%
again, like a
spirit guide, Robert

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.990 align:middle line:84%
was advising him on how to
do the copper engraving.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But what he did was
very interesting.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.960 align:middle line:84%
He had this vision of what
he calls the Hall of Los--

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.070 align:middle line:90%
L-O-S.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: L-O-S.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:14.758 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And this is
actually on the astral plane,

00:38:14.758 --> 00:38:17.440 align:middle line:84%
the upper astral plane where
these figures are frozen.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And as you look at them, they
illustrate your own past lives.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So what I think
the Hall of Los was

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:27.430 align:middle line:84%
was the causal plane where the
Akashic records are actually

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:28.340 align:middle line:90%
stored.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So he would actually help
people, his own as well as

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.010 align:middle line:84%
other people, review
of their past lives

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.990 align:middle line:90%
through this Hall of Los.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually a
spirit guide aspect here.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.592 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You must have a
million stories, Bruce.

00:38:40.592 --> 00:38:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, if you
look at spirit guides,

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.190 align:middle line:84%
they go back forever
in our history.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:51.130 align:middle line:84%
You go back to Egypt, Sumeria,
the Middle Eastern cultures,

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:52.870 align:middle line:90%
these things are not new.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.700 align:middle line:84%
They use the word
"New Age," "New Age"

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.530 align:middle line:90%
is actually a very bad name.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.600 align:middle line:84%
These principles have
been around forever.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism, for example, goes
back 50,000 years in Siberia

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:03.360 align:middle line:90%
for the origin of shamanism.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:84%
All of these disciplines-- my
discipline is energy healing.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.420 align:middle line:90%
It's shamanism.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.488 align:middle line:84%
Everything is,
acupuncture, everything,

00:39:09.488 --> 00:39:10.405 align:middle line:90%
they're all shamanism.

00:39:10.405 --> 00:39:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From all these
cases, what have you learned?

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Is there a common denominator
of what's happening here?

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: There is
a common denominator.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.470 align:middle line:84%
The first is you want to
access your higher self.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self comes from
the God energy complex.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:24.670 align:middle line:90%
It's you in your perfect form.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And you will eventually emerge
with that when you ascend.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, your higher self
functions as a dispatcher

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.485 align:middle line:90%
to bring in the spirit guides.

00:39:32.485 --> 00:39:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And it can actually
bring in an angel entity,

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.950 align:middle line:90%
although usually that's rare.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.660 align:middle line:84%
The spirit guides
are much more common.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I've also learned to ignore
all the negativity that you

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.540 align:middle line:84%
get from the mainstream
media, and people

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.350 align:middle line:84%
whining and complaining
about their lives.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge and constant.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Ignore that.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.480 align:middle line:84%
You go through your
own spiritual growth.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.910 align:middle line:84%
When you access
your higher self,

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and you do your self-hypnosis
or your meditation--

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.750 align:middle line:84%
they're both really
the same technique--

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:58.515 align:middle line:90%
then you can be all you can be.

00:39:58.515 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:90%
You can raise your spirituality.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Again my practice in life
is focusing on healing.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:04.940 align:middle line:84%
You can heal yourself
of little things

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and then move on
to the big things.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can affect your family
and your friends around you.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the more
you are empowered--

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:84%
this is the law of
attraction again--

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.250 align:middle line:84%
the more you're going
to empower other people,

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.355 align:middle line:84%
and the less likely you are
to be an energy vampire,

00:40:18.355 --> 00:40:20.230 align:middle line:84%
to drain people, which
is what you see a lot.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.063 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:40:21.063 --> 00:40:22.420 align:middle line:90%
This audience loves you, Bruce.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.670 align:middle line:90%
How do they get a hold of you?

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.180 align:middle line:84%
How can they get
to your website?

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.555 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They could go to
my home page on my website--

00:40:27.555 --> 00:40:29.350 align:middle line:90%
DrBruceGoldberg.com.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.450 align:middle line:84%
They can click on my
Facebook page there,

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:34.000 align:middle line:84%
the YouTube channel
with about 50 videos

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.160 align:middle line:84%
that we mentioned about
all the techniques I do.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.610 align:middle line:10%
Obviously my books and
CDs and my webinars,

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.490 align:middle line:10%
my monthly webinars,
are all on there.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.240 align:middle line:10%
They can experience
those because I always

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.500 align:middle line:10%
do hypnosis on that.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.420 align:middle line:10%
And they can contact
me through email

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.280 align:middle line:10%
or they can call my
toll free number.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.433 align:middle line:10%
The 1-800-KARMA4U is
my toll free number.

00:40:50.433 --> 00:40:52.350 align:middle line:10%
They can do any of those
things to contact me.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Bruce, keep
doing what you're doing.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.583 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: And keep doing
what you're doing, my friend.

00:40:56.583 --> 00:40:59.660 align:middle line:84%
You are the best and my
immediate best buddy here.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank you for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: My pleasure.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.367 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And having spirit
guides all over the place

00:41:04.367 --> 00:41:07.030 align:middle line:84%
to help us is kind of a nice
sobering effect, isn't it?

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.072 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: That's right.

00:41:08.072 --> 00:41:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And also that the presence
of Dexter Monterey

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:11.770 align:middle line:90%
always builds up my day, too.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.228 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dexter Monterey is me
in the future as a talk show

00:41:14.228 --> 00:41:15.028 align:middle line:90%
host.

00:41:15.028 --> 00:41:16.900 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.950 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]
