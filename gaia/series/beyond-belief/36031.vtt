>> George Noory: November
22nd, 1963, I was 13 years old.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I was in the English
class and my teacher,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.834 align:middle line:84%
Ms. Leonard [assumed spelling]
came into the class crying.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.903 align:middle line:90%
We didn't understand why.

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:39.006 align:middle line:84%
She had said that
President John F. Kennedy had

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:90%
been assassinated.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.842 align:middle line:90%
Well, through the minds

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.044 align:middle line:84%
of a little 13-year-old we
really didn't understand the

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.514 align:middle line:84%
scope of what she was really
talking about but later

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.751 align:middle line:90%
on in our lives, we surely did.

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:58.091 align:middle line:84%
A situation that has changed
the face of this planet.

>> [Background Music] This is
Walter Cronkite in our newsroom.

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:03.964 align:middle line:84%
And, there has been an
attempt as perhaps you know now

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:05.699 align:middle line:84%
on the life of President
Kennedy.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:09.002 align:middle line:84%
He was wounded in an automobile
driving from Dallas airport

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.306 align:middle line:84%
into downtown Dallas along with
Governor Connally of Texas.

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.641 align:middle line:84%
They were taken to
Parkland Hospital there

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.611 align:middle line:84%
where their condition
is as yet unknown.

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:20.047 align:middle line:84%
We have not been told of
their condition at Dallas.

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:23.516 align:middle line:84%
In a downtown hotel room, a
group who had been gathered

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:26.119 align:middle line:84%
to hear President Kennedy
and was awaiting his arrival.

now where Eddie Barker

in now as to the actual
condition of the President.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:41.301 align:middle line:84%
One is that he is dead;
this cannot be confirmed.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.403 align:middle line:84%
Another is that Governor
Connally is

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:44.805 align:middle line:90%
in the operating room.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.573 align:middle line:90%
This we have not confirmed.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:49.609 align:middle line:84%
The President was
whisked from the scene

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.412 align:middle line:90%
of an attempted assassination

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.382 align:middle line:84%
or assassination depending
upon his condition of course

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:59.786 align:middle line:84%
at this hour by bus
to Parkland hospital.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:04.358 align:middle line:84%

is in the emergency room

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:09.396 align:middle line:84%

on the first floor of Parkland.

Thank you.

>> GN: That video clip,
I'm sure for a lot

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:37.556 align:middle line:90%
of people brings chills.

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:38.992 align:middle line:90%
I was 13 years old.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:42.596 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really understand the
scope of what was going on.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:45.866 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, after
school me and my buddies we went

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.168 align:middle line:84%
out and we played ice
hockey in Detroit.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.803 align:middle line:84%
You know, just playing
in the streets,

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:52.005 align:middle line:90%
just skating up and down.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:52.773 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Sure.

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:54.141 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Our parents cried.

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:57.511 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this country has
ever been the same, has it?

00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:02.149 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: It was a threshold moment
and as I explained on the book.

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.785 align:middle line:84%
We've changed as a
nation fundamentally.

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:06.186 align:middle line:90%
It was the end of innocence.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the triumph of
what I call the New World Order.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.626 align:middle line:84%
We'll explain that
as we go along.

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.561 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: But everything changed.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.497 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was 17
and I had driven

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:18.965 align:middle line:90%
to school, high school that day.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.901 align:middle line:84%
And when I-- I couldn't
believe it

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:22.402 align:middle line:90%
when the announcement came on.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:25.072 align:middle line:84%
It's just too incredible
to absorb.

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:26.573 align:middle line:90%
I had seen the Kennedys.

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
My father was a labor
union, a lobbyist.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.145 align:middle line:84%
He was public relations
director of Brotherhood

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:35.248 align:middle line:84%
of Railroad Trainmen
in Cleveland.

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.984 align:middle line:84%
But like I was in the car,
and I turned on the radio

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:41.088 align:middle line:84%
and they were playing
the first ingau--

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:42.889 align:middle line:90%
is all the Inaugural Address.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.056 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:45.425 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: And he said, "Well, OK.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:49.563 align:middle line:84%
Then he had to be dead" because
why would you be playing all

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:51.631 align:middle line:84%
those recap of the
inaugural-- oh it was--

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:55.035 align:middle line:84%
and it was hard to even
continue functioning

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:59.206 align:middle line:84%
when I'd seen Kennedy, my
dad was very influential,

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:02.976 align:middle line:84%
and the union was at
Kennedy's election,

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.444 align:middle line:84%
and there was great
hope, I mean,

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.214 align:middle line:84%
he had really changed
fundamentally.

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:08.782 align:middle line:84%
The direction the
of the country--

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:09.583 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It was [inaudible]..

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.651 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: It felt different.

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.787 align:middle line:84%
You know, when it comes
the Eisenhower period.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:15.489 align:middle line:84%
I like Eisenhower
as a president.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.059 align:middle line:84%
I thought he was quite
good, but this was new.

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:90%
This was fresh.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.598 align:middle line:84%
It was young and the
ideas were invigorating.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:29.236 align:middle line:84%
So that for Kennedy to be killed
was almost an impossibility.

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:30.337 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:32.139 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: I could never
imagine it could happen.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.209 align:middle line:84%
And then at one stroke,
one day, a lightning coming

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.444 align:middle line:90%
from the skies, it were--

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:38.512 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It shattered our country.

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:39.479 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: It shattered the country.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.614 align:middle line:90%
We've never been the same.

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.781 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: No.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.383 align:middle line:84%
I remember the Frank
Sinatra song, High Hopes.

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:44.751 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.687 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That he changed into
John Kennedy's campaign song.

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:48.622 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: His campaign song.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.023 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And it was
just remarkable

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:55.295 align:middle line:84%
but what really struck me
Jerry, even at that age of 13,

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:59.299 align:middle line:84%
being at home watching the
video of Lee Harvey Oswald--

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.634 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.302 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- being carted through
the Dallas Police station,

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.604 align:middle line:84%
getting shot to death
by Jack Ruby.

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%
All of it was so surreal.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.211 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you imagine
the alleged assassin

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:14.414 align:middle line:84%
of our president being
carted through an area

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:17.684 align:middle line:84%
where people could actually get
to him, it didn't make sense.

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:20.287 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Well, the reporters
were crowding the halls

00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:25.425 align:middle line:84%
of the Dallas Police Department
and in fact Jack Ruby was in one

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:29.829 align:middle line:84%
of the so-called press
conferences as a press reporter

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.231 align:middle line:90%
as it were, asking a question.

00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:32.365 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Yeah, and he
wasn't a reporter.

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.733 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: He was not.

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.368 align:middle line:90%
He was a nightclub operator.

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:35.936 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Nightclub operator.

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:37.304 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Right.

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:39.039 align:middle line:84%
But he-- you know, wine and
dine all the police and it was

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.974 align:middle line:90%
at a constant figure--

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:41.908 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.109 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- in the
Police Department.

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:45.078 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, when Lee
Harvey Oswald said things

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:49.683 align:middle line:84%
like I remember watching,
when Oswald said "Well,

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:52.719 align:middle line:84%
I have not been charged with
shooting the president?"

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.621 align:middle line:84%
Someone said that to
me I think he said.

00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:58.258 align:middle line:84%
And someone shouts "You
have been charged with it"

00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:01.595 align:middle line:84%
as Oswald looks disgusted
at that moment.

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:02.629 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:03.997 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Like, he just
totally looks at--

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:05.298 align:middle line:84%
at that when I was watching
that, I said, "Wait a minute,

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:07.567 align:middle line:84%
this is not the reaction
of a guy

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:09.803 align:middle line:84%
who has just shot
the president."

00:06:09.803 --> 00:06:12.973 align:middle line:90%
And also he said "I'm a patsy."

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:15.442 align:middle line:84%
He was going through the hall
and he screamed "I'm a patsy."

00:06:15.442 --> 00:06:16.443 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:17.644 align:middle line:84%
What kind of a person
would say that?

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:20.113 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Now that hit me too
watching it and saying,

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:25.285 align:middle line:84%
you know, this-- then when
the-- when Ruby shot Oswald,

00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:26.987 align:middle line:84%
that's Sunday morning,
I was watching it live.

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:28.021 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: He had to be shut up.

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:29.222 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.491 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Well, and it was a
moment people can relate

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:34.928 align:middle line:84%
to younger people today
who were not alive then

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:37.696 align:middle line:84%
when the first plane flew
into the World Trade Center,

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:39.898 align:middle line:84%
I said "Well, it could be
anything" I mean I heard it--

00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:41.768 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: It could been an
accident, a horrible accident.

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:44.271 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: A plane flew into
the Empire State building

00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:45.672 align:middle line:90%
in World War II.

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:46.573 align:middle line:90%
OK, that happened.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.407 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.708 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: But then, turning on TV

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the second
plane hit--

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.011 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Then you knew.

00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:51.845 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: -- terrorism.

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:53.246 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And then the Pentagon.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.882 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: And then you immediately,
it was clear this was an attack.

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:56.683 align:middle line:90%
We were at war.

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:58.018 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:06:58.018 --> 00:07:03.023 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Well, also when Ruby
jumped out and shot Oswald,

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:05.725 align:middle line:84%
and instantly, he
say, "Mob hit."

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.327 align:middle line:84%
The chain-- it reframed
the whole--

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:08.662 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Absolutely.

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:11.364 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- incident because
suddenly, this was a silencing.

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:12.666 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That they
called covered it up.

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:14.768 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: It covered--
and also when--

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:17.671 align:middle line:84%
when Oswald is coming
out, I didn't put this

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:84%
in the book 'cause
I couldn't prove it

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.777 align:middle line:84%
but I was confident even
at that time, Oswald looks

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:24.878 align:middle line:90%
in the direction of Ruby--

00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:26.179 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: He stared at
him and he did see him.

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:27.314 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- and he
did recognize him.

00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:28.114 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.182 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: And then, you know,

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:31.885 align:middle line:84%
suddenly Ruby jumps
out and shoots him.

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:34.788 align:middle line:84%
And of course Oswald
has no instant to react,

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.089 align:middle line:90%
he's immediately shot--

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:37.324 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:39.326 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- collapses but
that was clearly a mob hit.

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:42.829 align:middle line:84%
And the way Ruby
subsequently acted,

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:45.598 align:middle line:84%
the things Ruby subsequently
said, you know,

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:48.368 align:middle line:84%
if you really want to know
this it reaches highest levels

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:51.204 align:middle line:84%
of government and you'll
never know the truth of this

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:53.673 align:middle line:84%
if you don't take
me to Washington

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:54.908 align:middle line:90%
where I could be secure.

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:55.975 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.111 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: And then, he
also made a comment;

00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:00.613 align:middle line:84%
Ruby did that this
would never happen

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
if Adlai Stevenson had
been vice president.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.518 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:08.588 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: So you know, Ruby was
telegraphing whenever a camera

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:10.123 align:middle line:90%
was on him.

00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:13.893 align:middle line:84%
In those moments between trials
or going to do an appearance

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:17.497 align:middle line:84%
on the trial just like Oswald
was trying to telegraph--

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.832 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.767 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: He said, I'm waiting
for someone to come forward.

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:22.936 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: It's an amazing story and
we're going to talk about all

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.771 align:middle line:90%
of that that led up to that.

00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:27.474 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back a little
bit, John F. Kennedy--

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:28.608 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Right.

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:29.509 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- he is a
Senator of Massachusetts.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.313 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: He decides he is going
to run for president primarily

00:08:33.313 --> 00:08:36.182 align:middle line:84%
because I guess he was
being pushed by his father.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.584 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:08:37.584 --> 00:08:41.855 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And his career and off he
goes, he was a Roman Catholic.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:43.356 align:middle line:84%
He had a strike against
in there.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.458 align:middle line:84%
There had never been a
Roman Catholic president

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:90%
in this country before.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.497 align:middle line:84%
And off he goes and
he gets the--

00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:53.833 align:middle line:84%
he gets the nomination of
the Democratic Convention,

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
does extremely well, Lyndon
Johnson comes in second.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:58.571 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:08:59.839 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: There has been talk

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:02.442 align:middle line:84%
that Kennedy selected
Johnson 'cause he knew he had

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:04.944 align:middle line:90%
to take Texas and the South.

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:07.347 align:middle line:84%
Other people say
that Edgar Hoover,

00:09:07.347 --> 00:09:11.217 align:middle line:84%
J. Edgar Hoover basically
said to Kennedy "I'm going

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:14.587 align:middle line:84%
to release reports of your
womanizing unless you take

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:16.556 align:middle line:90%
Johnson as your running mate."

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:17.957 align:middle line:90%
What's the truth there?

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:20.059 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Well, I think there was
pressure from Johnson as well

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:23.496 align:middle line:84%
and J. Edgar Hoover could
well have participated.

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:24.998 align:middle line:90%
Johnson wouldn't have hesitated

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:28.334 align:middle line:84%
to let Kennedy know he
would release information--

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:29.035 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:30.403 align:middle line:90%
They hated each other.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.706 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Oh they were-- Bobby
especially hated Lyndon Johnson.

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:36.409 align:middle line:84%
Bobby could never
stand Lyndon Johnson.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And the-- putting Johnson on the
ticket, remember the conventions

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.982 align:middle line:84%
in those days were
really fought out.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:45.919 align:middle line:84%
And it was not clear that
John Kennedy was going

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.888 align:middle line:84%
to get the nomination until
the convention started.

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:52.459 align:middle line:84%
They have floor fight and so
the concessions being made were

00:09:52.459 --> 00:09:56.463 align:middle line:84%
being made while the
convention was ongoing.

00:09:56.463 --> 00:09:58.631 align:middle line:90%
And the pressure put Lyndon

00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:01.668 align:middle line:84%
on the ticket was enormous
'cause what Lyndon Johnson

00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:03.536 align:middle line:84%
wanted more than anything
else was to be president.

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:04.304 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes.

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:05.605 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: He is power hungry.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.242 align:middle line:84%
He is, you know, all kinds
of his own history unfolds.

00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:11.344 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing about this
that's interesting George,

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:15.281 align:middle line:84%
it's fascinating and I do cover
this extensively in the book is

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:19.285 align:middle line:90%
that John Kennedy knew in 1956,

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:22.322 align:middle line:84%
he had lost the vice
presidential nomination

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:23.256 align:middle line:90%
to Estes Kefauver.

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:24.557 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: And Kefauver was a
senator, had crime hearings.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.128 align:middle line:90%
He had televised crime hearings.

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:31.331 align:middle line:84%
I remember watching
them as a kid.

00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Kennedy family
knew they needed publicity

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.835 align:middle line:90%
and they needed some forum.

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.103 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:39.839 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: So when the-- the
whole issue of the mob moving

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:43.877 align:middle line:84%
into the team search came up,
and it started with a family

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:46.079 align:middle line:84%
that I've write about
I've known extensively

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:48.414 align:middle line:84%
but it's largely
ignored in the history

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:84%
but very important;
the Elkins family.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle line:90%
JB Elkins was the chief witness

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.955 align:middle line:84%
in the McClellan
Committee Hearings.

00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:59.492 align:middle line:84%
February 1957, Bobby
Kennedy was the council--

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.627 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Hated Hoffa

00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:02.829 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Hated Hoffa and
this was the beginning

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.364 align:middle line:90%
of going after Hoffa.

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:08.568 align:middle line:84%
But it was a pact between the
western mob, the Protestants,

00:11:08.568 --> 00:11:13.172 align:middle line:84%
the Elkins mob and the Kennedys
in which they were also going

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:16.476 align:middle line:84%
after the Eastern mobs
which were the Italians--

00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:17.677 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.445 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- the Jews who had
not accepted Joe Kennedy

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:20.713 align:middle line:90%
when he was [inaudible].

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:21.915 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And those were the
folks who were into Cuba.

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:24.517 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Exactly, and
see with Meyer Lansky,

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.853 align:middle line:90%
you know, running the casinos.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So at any rate, John Kennedy
used the McClellan Committee

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.526 align:middle line:84%
Hearings to launch
his political career.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And that was an immediate
association that turned him

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.568 align:middle line:84%
against the Eastern mobs, father
against the Eastern mob kind

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:42.769 align:middle line:90%
of like a grudge master--

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- and will get
back at these guys--

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.572 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:47.407 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- who didn't
accept me in the '30s.

00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So when Bobby Kennedy
was Attorney General,

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.947 align:middle line:84%
basically the father of
Joseph Kennedy said go

00:11:53.947 --> 00:11:55.882 align:middle line:84%
after the Eastern mobs and
they continue to-- he did--

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:58.952 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, and they
brilliantly set up Kennedy

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:84%
to get the publicity as a
strong law enforcement ally.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.124 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:06.125 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, and
it was brilliant.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.627 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: The first
issue of Life Magazine

00:12:07.627 --> 00:12:09.762 align:middle line:84%
that Jack Kennedy
is on the cover.

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:13.333 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the 1957,
you go into that magazine

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:16.035 align:middle line:84%
and it has an article on
McClellan Committee Hearings,

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:18.471 align:middle line:84%
it's got a full page
picture of JB Elkins.

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:19.439 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:20.673 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: And Bobby
Kennedy and his book

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:84%
"The Enemy Within" says
this was the best witness,

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.146 align:middle line:84%
he had the best information even
though Elkins was a criminal,

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:28.314 align:middle line:90%
that all have been researched,

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:30.917 align:middle line:84%
they exposed it all
at the hearing.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:35.455 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, the-- the
story of Kennedy's launch

00:12:35.455 --> 00:12:38.191 align:middle line:84%
in the politics would
not have happened

00:12:38.191 --> 00:12:40.526 align:middle line:84%
without the McClellan
Committee Hearings

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:43.796 align:middle line:84%
and without the Elkins family
and all the information

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:46.733 align:middle line:84%
that permitted them to go
after Hoffa and the mob.

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:50.069 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So jump forward a few
years, Kennedy gets elected.

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.073 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: He defeats Nixon by
the closest margin ever.

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:55.174 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: With the help of he mob.

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: With the help
of the mob in Chicago.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.011 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:12:58.011 --> 00:12:59.379 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And everything else.

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:02.615 align:middle line:84%
So he is in, unbeknownst to
him at the time, Richard Nixon

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.918 align:middle line:84%
who was the vice president
is working on the Bay of Pigs

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.023 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And in the debates,
Kennedy is talking about it

00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:12.625 align:middle line:84%
and Nixon is talking
about how bad it would be

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.994 align:middle line:84%
to attack Cuba when
it was his plan.

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:16.329 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Right.

00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:17.563 align:middle line:84%
Well, see that's another-- I
told that story in the book.

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:20.933 align:middle line:84%
It has not really been
told as in a much detailed.

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.802 align:middle line:90%
The Kennedy family learned

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.538 align:middle line:84%
that Richard Nixon had
been planning the Bay

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:28.608 align:middle line:84%
of Pigs Invasion as
an October surprised.

00:13:28.608 --> 00:13:29.709 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yup.

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:32.045 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: I got him to,
Dick Bissell, CIA and--

00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:34.013 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And had it'd
been successful,

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:36.015 align:middle line:84%
it would have catapulted
him to a president.

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Well, if Nixon
have done the Bay of Pigs,

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.552 align:middle line:90%
he probably would have succeeded

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:41.087 align:middle line:84%
because Nixon would
not have hesitated--

00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:42.388 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: He would reinforce--

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:46.059 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- to use US military
and force to take Castro.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:47.126 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Exactly.

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: And he would
have been a big hero

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.431 align:middle line:90%
because this was early on 1960.

00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:52.832 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: There were
no missiles in Cuba.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:57.103 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: No missiles and we would
have in a sense liberated Cuba

00:13:57.103 --> 00:13:59.338 align:middle line:84%
from communism, all
the refugees--

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.406 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: The Cubans
in Miami wanted.

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:02.408 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: It would have
been a huge success.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:05.778 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy family realized that
if Nixon got to pull this off,

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:90%
he probably lose the election.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.414 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:10.383 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: And they were tipped
off including Elkins family

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:14.087 align:middle line:84%
and others notified them that
this plan was in the works.

00:14:14.087 --> 00:14:17.523 align:middle line:84%
So John Kennedy in the fourth
debate, complete surprises,

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.025 align:middle line:90%
I think we should invade Cuba.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:20.259 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Beautiful, brilliant.

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:22.161 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Brilliant, and
Nixon who, you know,

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:23.362 align:middle line:90%
who was in the debate--

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:25.198 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: He is got to say
"I can't agree with them."

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.299 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: We can't--
it'd be irresponsible,

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:90%
we can't invade Cuba.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.334 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:29.635 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: So Nixon gets
out of the debate.

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:33.806 align:middle line:84%
He is leaving because also
Kennedy had an intelligence

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:37.443 align:middle line:84%
briefing from Allen Dulles
who was head of the CIA.

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:38.778 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Whom he fired?

00:14:38.778 --> 00:14:39.345 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Later.

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:40.413 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Later.

00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:42.281 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: But Kennedy
family made, you know,

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:46.953 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy has made Dulles, tell
him about the Bay of Pigs

00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:47.887 align:middle line:90%
which they knew about.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.122 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: You know, but Dulles
probably wasn't planning

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.993 align:middle line:84%
to disclose that but once they
knew the Kennedy's demanded a

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:56.362 align:middle line:84%
briefing on the Bay
of Pigs Invasion.

00:14:56.362 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So now we fast forward, and
John Kennedy is the president.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.837 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA comes over and says
"Remember that little invasion

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:08.207 align:middle line:84%
that we, you know,
you jumps as on."

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:10.576 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, Nixon was
leaving in six crises,

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Nixon goes on and on about
how dishonest Kennedy was,

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:84%
how horrible this was
to trick him this way.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.218 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And deep down,
he is biting his tongue.

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:20.453 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: He is just
angry as it can be.

00:15:20.453 --> 00:15:22.355 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Surely, we got a
little video of Allen Dulles

00:15:22.355 --> 00:15:23.489 align:middle line:84%
who was then the
head of the CIA.

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:24.457 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:15:24.457 --> 00:15:26.826 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We got to
take a look at this.

00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I've asked Mr. Allen Dulles
to stay on, the director

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.966 align:middle line:84%
of the Central Intelligence
Agency

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:36.669 align:middle line:84%
and he was exceeded
to that request.

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:41.974 align:middle line:84%
He served every president since
Wilson in a variety of capacity

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and the continuity of
stability and direction

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:84%
in this particular
post is imperative.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.182 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So he decides
to keep Dulles

00:15:49.182 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:90%
but he ends up firing the guy.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.253 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Yes, well see, it
probably his big mistake

00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:56.789 align:middle line:84%
for John Kennedy to
have kept Allen Dulles.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:16:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Allen Dulles was never
on John Kennedy's side.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.963 align:middle line:84%
Allen Dulles was playing
for his own team ever.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.532 align:middle line:84%
We will get into
this but Allen Dulles

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:10.369 align:middle line:84%
and his brother John Foster
Dulles had been primarily

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:12.338 align:middle line:84%
responsible for financing
the Nazis.

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:14.774 align:middle line:90%
We financed Hitler.

00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:16.742 align:middle line:84%
Wall Street, Brown
Brothers Harriman,--

00:16:16.742 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.645 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- the Harriman Brothers
firm and the other partners

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:23.382 align:middle line:84%
by the way in this firm were
Prescott Bush and George Walker.

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:24.483 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.853 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: The patriarchs
of the Bush family,

00:16:26.853 --> 00:16:29.555 align:middle line:90%
Connecticut Yale got together--

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Were supporters
of the Nazi?

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.761 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: And that we're running
with the Nazis Union Bank

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:38.331 align:middle line:84%
which Roosevelt has
it closed down.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:42.435 align:middle line:84%
It took him months after Pearl
Harbor to close this bank down

00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:46.038 align:middle line:84%
but the Dulles and the Bushes
were running a Nazi bank

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:48.808 align:middle line:84%
in New York, it's a
clearing house for Hitler.

00:16:48.808 --> 00:16:50.476 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Why don't they
get him for treason?

00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:53.246 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Well, in this period
of time, we weren't war with--

00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:54.212 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: With the Nazis.

00:16:54.212 --> 00:16:55.448 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- the Nazis
and of course,

00:16:55.448 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:84%
they were saying we
were rebuilding Europe

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.751 align:middle line:90%
and this was our hall Fascism--

00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:01.087 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:17:01.087 --> 00:17:02.889 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- at that time, did
not necessarily looked today

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:05.525 align:middle line:90%
as Fascism as it does today.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:07.326 align:middle line:84%
But at any rate, they
bought into the Hitler.

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
The original New World
Order, the original idea

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.299 align:middle line:84%
that this was a new
order of things.

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:14.634 align:middle line:90%
It was Hitler's idea.

00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:16.568 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, you talked about
the New World Order Jerry;

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:18.704 align:middle line:84%
I want us to look at a
little clip about that.

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:22.174 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at this
New World Order theory.

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:24.043 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: I'm just going to make
one point 'cause I want to kind

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:84%
of jump into the middle of the
book which is that my accusation

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.415 align:middle line:84%
on Jack Kennedy who
was the first victim

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:31.484 align:middle line:90%
of the New World Order.

00:17:31.484 --> 00:17:37.156 align:middle line:84%
And there was Allen Dulles who
Kennedy fired from the CIA,

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:42.328 align:middle line:84%
a CIA Director after the Bay
of Pigs fiasco that was one

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:45.431 align:middle line:84%
of the mastermind behind the
plot, as well as under Johnson

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:48.801 align:middle line:84%
and then they can conjunction
with various elements of the mob

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.603 align:middle line:90%
that it turned on Kennedy.

00:17:50.603 --> 00:17:53.773 align:middle line:84%
I only got this New World Order
theory 'cause it's been my

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:58.611 align:middle line:84%
fundamental hypothesis about the
assassination since it happened,

00:17:58.611 --> 00:18:01.347 align:middle line:84%
a Warren Commission
was it cover of.

00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:05.718 align:middle line:84%
And that is that-- there
was evidence provided

00:18:05.718 --> 00:18:10.022 align:middle line:84%
to the committee that Lee
Harvey Oswald was an FBI agent.

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:12.091 align:middle line:84%
They even had his
number for the FBI.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:15.595 align:middle line:84%
He was being paid 200 dollars
a month as an informant

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and that there was a
huge CIA file existence.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.268 align:middle line:84%
They had Lee Harvey
Oswald's CIA number.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.235 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, there's
no question,

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:24.503 align:middle line:90%
something was going on there.

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:25.304 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: There's no question.

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:28.274 align:middle line:90%
The whole Warren Commission

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:31.377 align:middle line:84%
which included Allen
Dulles after he was fired--

00:18:31.377 --> 00:18:32.144 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:33.279 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: -- by Jack Kennedy.

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Tell me, there's
not a conflict there.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.816 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Of course and
the whole purpose was

00:18:36.816 --> 00:18:39.018 align:middle line:90%
to make sure no information

00:18:39.018 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:84%
about the assassination
ever got back

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.955 align:middle line:90%
to the CIA, implicated the CIA.

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:44.156 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Exactly:

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:49.095 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: I mean, Oswald
supposed to assassins file

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:52.765 align:middle line:84%
with the CIA is about
50,000 pages

00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:90%
and it was started in 1960.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.935 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Wasn't he a double agent?

00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:59.572 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Yes, in fact, James
Angleton who maintained the file

00:18:59.572 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
of the CIA, maybe the closest
associate of Allen Dulles

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:08.481 align:middle line:84%
to the CIA was maintaining files
of what we call this, you know,

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.684 align:middle line:84%
fake defectors and were double
agents who were recruiting

00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:14.086 align:middle line:84%
from the military,
who are really loyal

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:16.856 align:middle line:84%
to the United States but they
said they were going to give

00:19:16.856 --> 00:19:19.158 align:middle line:84%
up their citizenship
and go to Russia

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.993 align:middle line:90%
in order to penetrate the KGB.

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.028 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:19:22.028 --> 00:19:22.862 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: And Oswald
was in that program.

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:23.796 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: He was one of those.

00:19:23.796 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: He was one of those.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.965 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes.

00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:27.767 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: So, there was never
any doubt but I've always felt

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:84%
that Oswald was most
likely working even closest

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.506 align:middle line:84%
with Naval Intelligence
so I say so on the book.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:37.109 align:middle line:84%
And good reason to believe he
was associated with the FBI,

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:39.578 align:middle line:84%
he was making 200
dollars a month,

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:42.014 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't seem like
a lot today.

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:42.548 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:43.949 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yeah.

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:48.854 align:middle line:84%
But he-- the FBI in Dallas even
destroyed part, they burned part

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:53.292 align:middle line:84%
of Oswald's file when he
became noticed as the assassin.

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:57.897 align:middle line:84%
But the whole point was the
Warren Commission, Lee Rankin,

00:19:57.897 --> 00:20:00.332 align:middle line:84%
the chief counsel
writes a memo and says,

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:03.035 align:middle line:84%
"We have this information,
what are we going to do it?"

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:06.472 align:middle line:84%
On January 27, 1964, the
Warren Commission meets

00:20:06.472 --> 00:20:09.809 align:middle line:84%
in executive session
and Allan Dulles says,

00:20:09.809 --> 00:20:11.744 align:middle line:84%
"This information
is just too damaging

00:20:11.744 --> 00:20:14.246 align:middle line:84%
to the agencies,
the FBI and CIA.

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:16.782 align:middle line:84%
We can't let the American
people know this."

00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:19.318 align:middle line:84%
So the Warren Commission
lies and says,

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:22.721 align:middle line:84%
"Oswald has no connection
with the CIA

00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:26.358 align:middle line:84%
and the FBI even though the
evidence was on the table.

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:30.663 align:middle line:84%
Now, well, this goes back to
reframe Oswald, Oswald first

00:20:30.663 --> 00:20:33.365 align:middle line:84%
of all I think was in the lunch
room through the whole shooting.

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:35.568 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That's where he was
spotted after the shooting.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:36.602 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Precisely.

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:37.737 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: He's on the
second floor, right?

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.538 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: One of the police
jumps off the motorcycle

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:42.475 align:middle line:84%
in the motorcade, runs
into the building,

00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:45.177 align:middle line:84%
gets one of the supervisors
from the building.

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:47.947 align:middle line:84%
These guys run upstairs and on
the second floor there is Oswald

00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:51.484 align:middle line:84%
in the lunch room drinking
a Coca Cola not being upset,

00:20:51.484 --> 00:20:53.853 align:middle line:84%
not looking like he
just ran down the stairs

00:20:53.853 --> 00:20:56.222 align:middle line:90%
after shooting the president.

00:20:56.222 --> 00:20:59.525 align:middle line:84%
And Oswald very calm, but
these guys say he works here.

00:20:59.525 --> 00:21:02.628 align:middle line:84%
He's not part of the deal
and the comp of the business,

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:84%

ran off to look--

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:05.865 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And a killer.

00:21:05.865 --> 00:21:06.899 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: He was calm, collected,

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:09.168 align:middle line:84%
and he walks out
of the building.

00:21:09.168 --> 00:21:10.503 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:21:10.503 --> 00:21:13.172 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: He comes out of the
front door, calmly walks out.

00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:16.108 align:middle line:84%
In fact there was someone-- one
of the reporters was looking

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.711 align:middle line:84%
for a phone and Oswald
directs him

00:21:18.711 --> 00:21:21.981 align:middle line:84%
to a phone inside the Texas
School Book Depository,

00:21:21.981 --> 00:21:25.818 align:middle line:84%

to take a bus home.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:28.621 align:middle line:90%
He takes a cab where the bus is.

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.589 align:middle line:90%

00:25:28.961 --> 00:25:32.765 align:middle line:84%

in Chicago-- I mean that--

00:25:32.765 --> 00:25:35.768 align:middle line:84%

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:49.281 align:middle line:84%
The security not even
that tight to begin with--

00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:52.785 align:middle line:84%
I mean the motorcade should
have been questioned to go

00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:56.455 align:middle line:84%
through this whole Dealey
Plaza area to begin with except

00:25:56.455 --> 00:25:59.391 align:middle line:84%
that it was the closest way
to get onto the freeway.

00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:06.832 align:middle line:84%
down Houston Street from

00:26:06.832 --> 00:26:11.703 align:middle line:84%

00:26:17.309 --> 00:26:19.711 align:middle line:84%

go through it fast

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.252 align:middle line:84%

00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:28.454 align:middle line:90%

00:26:28.454 --> 00:26:32.124 align:middle line:84%

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.668 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: It's obvious because
you can see the red lights go

00:26:42.668 --> 00:26:43.469 align:middle line:90%
on in the limo [inaudible]--

00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:44.269 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And it turned around.

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: It turned around.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.338 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And he said
he didn't do that.

00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:48.273 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: He turned around
completely around.

00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:49.842 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Now he's dead,
that driver is dead.

00:26:49.842 --> 00:26:50.843 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes, he is.

00:26:50.843 --> 00:26:52.177 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That Secret
Service driver.

00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:53.245 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:26:53.245 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
He's dead but the--
watching the videos

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.050 align:middle line:84%
of it there was a completely
lack of performance in terms

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:01.653 align:middle line:84%
of what you expect of the
Secret Service that day.

00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:04.356 align:middle line:84%
They should have all
been much more on alert.

00:27:04.356 --> 00:27:06.058 align:middle line:84%
They should have been
at the limousine.

00:27:06.058 --> 00:27:08.927 align:middle line:84%
The motorcycle should have
been on either side so you got

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:10.929 align:middle line:90%
to have instant response.

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:13.332 align:middle line:84%
Instead with the
shooting occurs,

00:27:13.332 --> 00:27:14.867 align:middle line:84%
all the agents are
looking around

00:27:14.867 --> 00:27:16.835 align:middle line:84%
and looking back,
looking at Kennedy.

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Making the fireworks,

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.638 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know
what was going on.

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:20.405 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yeah.

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:22.341 align:middle line:90%
And the ability to respond

00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:25.043 align:middle line:84%
in those situations
instantly is a difference

00:27:25.043 --> 00:27:27.112 align:middle line:84%
between saving a
president's life

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:28.714 align:middle line:84%
and having the president
be killed.

00:27:28.714 --> 00:27:32.017 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Were all those
full pause done on purpose

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:84%
or were they just
silly stupidness sense?

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.756 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: I think it was
a whole high up ordered

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:38.991 align:middle line:90%
that this was not going to be--

00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:39.758 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right,

00:27:39.758 --> 00:27:40.859 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: -- tight security.

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: The rank and
file obviously looked

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.427 align:middle line:90%
like they're confused.

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:43.362 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: They want
to do their job.

00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:44.129 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: You can see them--

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:45.898 align:middle line:90%
I mean they're objecting

00:27:45.898 --> 00:27:47.833 align:middle line:84%
that the guy is shrugging
his shoulders.

00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.234 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you let me do my job?

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:50.068 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:51.103 align:middle line:90%
What do you calling me off for?

00:27:51.103 --> 00:27:53.772 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: It's so--
it has to be a high

00:27:53.772 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:84%
up orders including
along the motorcade

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.978 align:middle line:84%
when there are windows
that could be opened.

00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:03.749 align:middle line:84%
There should have been much
greater security all along the

00:28:03.749 --> 00:28:07.719 align:middle line:84%
route for any building that
could have an open window

00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:09.221 align:middle line:84%
and clearly there
are many of them.

00:28:09.221 --> 00:28:10.856 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are as in--

00:28:10.856 --> 00:28:13.325 align:middle line:84%
waving out of the
windows through downtown.

00:28:13.325 --> 00:28:15.327 align:middle line:84%
It was all open window
the entire--

00:28:15.327 --> 00:28:18.297 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: There were witnesses who
said they saw several gunmens--

00:28:18.297 --> 00:28:19.231 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:19.798 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- walking
around up there.

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:20.232 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Right.

00:28:20.232 --> 00:28:21.366 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:22.701 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- a couple in
the Grassy Knoll area.

00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:25.237 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: Several of witnesses,
I point them out of the book

00:28:25.237 --> 00:28:29.441 align:middle line:84%
that they were multiple people
observed in that sixth floor.

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:32.411 align:middle line:84%
It's unlikely that that's
where the fatal shots came

00:28:32.411 --> 00:28:37.749 align:middle line:84%
from because if you really had
one sniper Lee Harvey Oswald,

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:41.353 align:middle line:84%
lone shy shooter, I don't
think he fired a shot that day.

00:28:41.353 --> 00:28:44.356 align:middle line:84%
The best shot would be
coming down Houston Street.

00:28:44.356 --> 00:28:45.991 align:middle line:90%
The car is coming right

00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:84%
down toward the Texas
School Book Depository

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.562 align:middle line:90%
and then makes a sharp left.

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:52.397 align:middle line:84%
The car is almost
at a standstill.

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:55.901 align:middle line:84%
You're looking down you got a
full body shot on everybody--

00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:57.135 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:59.838 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: -- and that's the
best angle from that window.

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:02.908 align:middle line:84%
Instead you wait until
the car goes, you know,

00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:05.978 align:middle line:84%
several hundred yards
down the road

00:29:05.978 --> 00:29:09.247 align:middle line:90%
on Elm Street behind the tree.

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:11.483 align:middle line:84%
And you got-- then
you start shooting

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:13.885 align:middle line:84%
and you only see the back of the
head, the shoulders at the back

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:15.454 align:middle line:84%
of the head-- I mean
this is not a video game.

00:29:15.454 --> 00:29:16.521 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And what everybody--

00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:17.556 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: You're not going
to get more points

00:29:17.556 --> 00:29:18.657 align:middle line:90%
for difficulty of shot.

00:29:18.657 --> 00:29:20.192 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What everybody
was saying Jerry too

00:29:20.192 --> 00:29:22.761 align:middle line:84%
as they saw the gunmen
walking around--

00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:24.062 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: Yes.

00:29:24.062 --> 00:29:25.831 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- on the street but
they all thought they were

00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:26.798 align:middle line:90%
Secret Service.

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:27.899 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: And they thought
they were --

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:31.269 align:middle line:84%
and there were also
Secret Service present.

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:33.338 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there
were no Secret Service

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:35.674 align:middle line:84%
at the Texas School Book
Depository or Dealey Plaza.

00:29:35.674 --> 00:29:36.441 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:37.075 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: They weren't there.

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:38.477 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's crazy.

00:29:38.477 --> 00:29:39.878 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: They were riding either
with the limousine or they were

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:42.981 align:middle line:84%
at the airport or at the-- where
Kennedy was going to give speech

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:44.983 align:middle line:90%
at the trade center, Trade Mart.

00:29:44.983 --> 00:29:47.519 align:middle line:84%
But no Secret Service
were on the Knoll

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:50.322 align:middle line:84%
yet people are showing
identification saying,

00:29:50.322 --> 00:29:51.256 align:middle line:90%
we're Secret Service.

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:53.191 align:middle line:90%
You can't stand here.

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:57.129 align:middle line:84%
You can't be here, and
telling people where to stand.

00:29:57.129 --> 00:30:01.233 align:middle line:84%
That to me was also very
suspicious as if you're staging

00:30:01.233 --> 00:30:04.536 align:middle line:84%
or you're managing how the
shooting is going to be.

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:05.737 align:middle line:84%
You know where the
shooters are going to be.

00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:08.440 align:middle line:84%
You know you can't afford
to have anybody standing

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and it was all orchestrated
that way by the security forces.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.045 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's a tragedy.

00:30:13.045 --> 00:30:14.579 align:middle line:90%
>> JC: And how do people walk

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:17.716 align:middle line:84%
around with identification
saying they're Secret Service

00:30:17.716 --> 00:30:19.818 align:middle line:84%
as the Warren Commission
doesn't investigate.

00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:20.819 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Doesn't investigate.

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> JC: It doesn't
investigate that.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.388 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We're talking with
Jerry Corsi, his book,

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:90%
"Who Really Killed Kennedy?"

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:29.061 align:middle line:84%
It's just a fascinating
story of his investigation

00:30:29.061 --> 00:30:32.264 align:middle line:84%
into what happened leading
up to November 22nd,

00:30:32.264 --> 00:30:35.901 align:middle line:90%
1963 and thereafter as well.

00:30:35.901 --> 00:30:38.603 align:middle line:84%
There's much more to
talk about on this story.

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:42.274 align:middle line:84%
You just stay tune to Beyond
Belief here on Gaiam TV.
