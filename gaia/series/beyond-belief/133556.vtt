left the hospital in Dallas,

but we do not know to
where he has proceeded.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Presumably, he will be taking
the oath of office shortly

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.855 align:middle line:84%

>>GEORGE NOORY: I
was 13 years old when

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.710 align:middle line:10%
that happened, when I saw
Walter Cronkite on CBS News so

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:10%
emotional.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:10%
In my history in
broadcasting, it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:10%
was the only time that I've seen
Walter Cronkite that emotional.

about the JFK assassination

right here on "Beyond Belief."

>>Lamar Waldron has
spent decades unraveling

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.710 align:middle line:84%
one of the most fascinating
conspiracies of all time--

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:90%
the assassination of JFK.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:10%
He and co-author Thom Hartmann
have earned widespread praise

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:10%
for their meticulous research in
the book "Ultimate Sacrifice."

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:10%
Their follow-up work,
"Legacy of Secrecy"

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:10%
is under development
as a feature film.

They found evidence
establishing plans

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:10%
for a coup in Cuba

back to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Lamar, thank you for joining us.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate it.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMAR WALDRON: Great
to be with you, George.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.863 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your work here,
"The Hidden History

00:02:03.863 --> 00:02:07.345 align:middle line:84%
of the JFK Assassination"
is absolutely riveting.

00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot
of books written

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
about the JFK
assassination, but you

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.874 align:middle line:90%
seem to put it all together.

00:02:12.874 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Well, this
book was basically

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:10%
about trying to tie
everything together

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.090 align:middle line:10%
in a book that was
less than 900 pages.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like that.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Well, because
my first two books,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.133 align:middle line:10%
"Ultimate Sacrifice"
and "Legacy of Secrecy"

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:10%
were both over 900 pages.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:10%
And each had 2,000 end notes.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:10%
But I felt like I needed to
write a book that just really

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:10%
laid out the basic,
exciting story

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.670 align:middle line:10%
and didn't get bogged down with
a lot of incredible detail,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:10%
which is useful for historians
and JFK researchers,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:10%
but that the general public
might have trouble following.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So this book really
just lays out,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:84%
here's who killed JFK,
here's why they did it,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
here's how they
did it, and here's

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
how they got away
with it and why

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
the cover-up didn't
just start then

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.117 align:middle line:90%
but is continuing to this day.

00:02:57.117 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.740 align:middle line:84%
How old were you when
JFK was assassinated?

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: I believe
I was nine years old.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.670 align:middle line:10%
And I was sitting in
a school classroom,

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:10%
and they came in and talked,
and we were just all kind

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.010 align:middle line:10%
of stunned.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.397 align:middle line:10%
Because JFK to a 9-year-old
in the early '60s--

00:03:16.397 --> 00:03:17.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You don't get it.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Well, I
didn't fully grasp

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:10%
when the assassination
was, but he

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:10%
was the combination of
the most famous movie

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:10%
star and the biggest
superhero on the planet.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.129 align:middle line:84%
Because he was on
TV all the time.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
He was on the cover
of every magazine

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.170 align:middle line:90%
with his beautiful wife.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:90%
And so we just-- it was Camelot.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:90%
And how could this happen?

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:90%
It was shocking.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I was playing
hooky from church

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:84%
a couple of days later
on Sunday morning,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
pretending to be--
I had a little cold,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
but I pretended it
was a lot worse,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:84%
first time my parents had
ever let me stay home alone.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.261 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching
cartoons, which

00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
was the whole reason
I wanted to stay home

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:90%
from church that morning.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly the news breaks in.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm nine years old, home
alone for the first time,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:84%
parents were going to come
back quick because I'm there

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.530 align:middle line:90%
by myself.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:84%
But cartoons, cuts
into the news,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:90%
they're showing the transfer.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you see this
guy come out of the crowd

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:90%
and shoot Oswald.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And obviously the
newscasters were all shocked.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
traumatic to me.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:84%
But I really didn't
have any more interest

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.580 align:middle line:84%
in the assassination
than anyone else

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:84%
until around the 25th
anniversary in 1988.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:84%
I figured there are experts,
there are historians,

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
there are investigators
looking into all this.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:90%
They've got it figured out.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.360 align:middle line:84%
For the 25th anniversary, my
sometimes-collaborator Tom

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Hartmann and I just
started to dig in,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:84%
first thinking we write
a historical novel,

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.099 align:middle line:84%
and then many,
many years later--

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this
full time [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.098 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You haven't stopped.

00:04:53.098 --> 00:04:55.610 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Well, you can't
stop, because there are so

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:10%
many files that
have been released,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.930 align:middle line:10%
but a lot of the best ones
are still kept secret.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And my mission in life now is to
get all of those files released

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
while I can still enjoy
them, but certainly

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.490 align:middle line:84%
so that other people
can so the government

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
doesn't keep making the same
mistakes decade after decade,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.170 align:middle line:90%
year after year.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was 13 years old.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I was an English
class, Ms. Leonard,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
when she came in crying,
telling us about that.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And we at 13 did
not quite apprehend

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and grasp the
complexity of all this.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I found her last year,
Lamar, on Facebook.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And after all these years,
I had to ask her what

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:90%
that moment was like for her.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:90%
And she remembered it.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:90%
She remembered it.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't remember that
we were in class with her

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:84%
at that specific time, but
she remembered the episode

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:90%
and what happened.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And this country has
never been the same

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:90%
since that tragedy occurred.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And I-- as you have found out
subsequently, it was a coup.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
It was a plan to get rid of a
president for various reasons,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:90%
which we'll get into.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But this was the first time
that this country was literally

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:90%
taken over.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And they decided, and they
went for it, didn't they?

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: They did.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And other countries
have gone through this.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.545 align:middle line:84%
They did it in other
countries before.

00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, this was--

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Some of them
initiated by us, by the way.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Well,
that's exactly right.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And then other people
would assassinate

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:90%
the people we put into power.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And I do remember a
former Harvard classmate

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:84%
of Kennedy, Bernard
Fensterwald, who was later

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
a Senate investigator who
founded a very important center

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.425 align:middle line:84%
in Washington with James Lesar
the Assassination Records

00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:45.620 align:middle line:90%
and Research Center.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.060 align:middle line:84%
He said it's really
scary when you

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.630 align:middle line:84%
look at how many American
elections have been decided

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
since JFK at the end
of the barrel of a gun,

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:84%
that if JFK hadn't been
killed, the '64 election would

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:90%
have been different.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:84%
If Nixon hadn't
committed treason in '68

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:84%
to prolong the Vietnam
War, Hubert Humphrey

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:84%
might have been elected
with the Iranian hostages

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:90%
and that situation.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So it is kind of scary--
and then Gerald Ford even

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:84%
being alive to run after
escaping two assassination

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.600 align:middle line:90%
attempts.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So we like to think of
America as a stable democracy,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.960 align:middle line:84%
but until we get
all the facts out

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and all the documents out,
we don't have all the facts.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.130 align:middle line:90%
And things could happen again.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:90%
And they keep on happening.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Kennedy
was a very strange person.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.541 align:middle line:84%
His father, of
course, as you know,

00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:84%
pushed him and influenced
him after brother Joe

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:90%
died in World War II.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that
father Joe wanted

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.140 align:middle line:84%
to push into politics
and the presidency.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
He then had to fall
down to brother John,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:90%
JFK, when Joseph got killed.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:84%
But Joseph Kennedy
did everything he

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.930 align:middle line:90%
could to get his son elected.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:84%
He was a congressman,
was a senator.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And Kennedy used his
influence with the Mob

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and with Prohibition to
generate a lot of money

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:84%
that he used as an
influence for Kennedy.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.742 align:middle line:84%
But they bought that
election in 1960.

00:08:11.742 --> 00:08:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Well, now, we
do have to be careful.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I wound
up, oddly enough,

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.550 align:middle line:84%
while I've written three JFK
books, I did a lot of research

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
from my Nixon book, "The
Hidden History of Watergate,"

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:84%
on the '60 election
specifically.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
surprised to find out

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.770 align:middle line:84%
that several things that a
lot of people believe really

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
don't bear out once
you dig deep into them.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:84%
Because the Mafia,
as you just said,

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:39.179 align:middle line:84%
they like to claim credit
for electing JFK in 1960.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:84%
However, that's what
the Mafia claims.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:84%
The Mafia's relationship with
Joe Kennedy was very complex.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a love-hate.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.798 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: It was a
love-hate, because he

00:08:48.798 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:84%
had the respect and the access
to normal business and society

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.670 align:middle line:84%
channels that the
Mafia didn't have.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.560 align:middle line:90%
So it was totally a love-hate.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And Joe Kennedy was essentially
the Bill Gates of his time.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So as I found out,
sure, the Chicago Mafia

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.400 align:middle line:84%
claimed they carried
Illinois for JFK.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:10%
But when political scientists
looked at the actual vote

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.070 align:middle line:10%
tallies, and as
one of them said,

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.720 align:middle line:10%
the fact that the Democrats
in Chicago would need Mafia

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.049 align:middle line:10%
help to carry Chicago
overwhelmingly when you already

00:09:24.049 --> 00:09:25.340 align:middle line:10%
have the mayor in your pocket--

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.631 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It was probably
going to happen anyway, right?

00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:32.000 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Right, because Mayor
Daley, super powerful-- he

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.230 align:middle line:10%
was big for JFK.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So the Mafia actually
did not-- not only

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.810 align:middle line:84%
did they not help
JFK get elected,

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.849 align:middle line:84%
they had given tons of
money and their support--

00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
try to assassinate

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Castro-- for Richard Nixon.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Because it was in the '50s
when the Mafia basically

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:84%
got to run wild under
the Nixon-Eisenhower

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower had heart
trouble, so he even

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.129 align:middle line:84%
had to leave things to Nixon,
vice president, for a while.

00:10:00.129 --> 00:10:02.420 align:middle line:84%
J. Edgar Hoover was saying
the Mafia didn't even exist.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:84%
The Mafia ran wild in
America, ran wild in Cuba.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was only John
and Robert Kennedy

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.960 align:middle line:84%
who went after the Mafia
in the Senate hearings

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:84%
where were Senator John
F. Kennedy and his council

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.825 align:middle line:84%
brother Bobby, they would
drag up Carlos Marcello

00:10:18.825 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:90%
and Sam Giancana.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Kennedy had a
relationship with the Mob.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.015 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was having
sexual relations--

00:10:26.015 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Well, let's
clarify that, George.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --with
Giancana's girlfriend.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Again, we have to
draw distinction between having

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:84%
relations with Sam
Giancana's girlfriend, which

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.030 align:middle line:84%
was a set-up, by
the way-- I mean,

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.844 align:middle line:84%
Sam Giancana's man in
Hollywood and Vegas,

00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:84%
big role in the
assassination, was

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Johnny Roselli, suave
guy, dapper Mafia don

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:90%
sort of guy, ladies' man.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:84%
The list of women Johnny
Roselli had been with starts

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.670 align:middle line:84%
with Marilyn Monroe
and goes on from there.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually a
set-up, because they

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
knew the kind of woman who
would appeal to John F. Kennedy.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would be a woman
who had two arms and two legs.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.436 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Well,
no, she actually--

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
after everything.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.601 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: She actually
had a lot of Jackie

00:11:13.601 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:84%
about her, Judith
Campbell Exner,

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.410 align:middle line:84%
for some of your listeners
who may not know.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that was actually
kind of a set-up.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So JFK had a relationship
with Marilyn Monroe

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:90%
and Judy Campbell, totally.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:84%
But JFK went after the mafia,
I think, for two big reasons.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:84%
One was to make a
name for himself.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.449 align:middle line:90%
And Bobby pushed it.

00:11:33.449 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: And Bobby pushed it.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:84%
The other was, I mean, they were
well aware of all of the rumors

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.140 align:middle line:84%
about their father
and the Mafia.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.694 align:middle line:84%
So this was one way they
had to counter those rumors.

00:11:44.694 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Look, we're going to
go after the Mafia.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
give credit to JFK,

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't just an
empty campaign promise.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Once he was elected and he
appointed his brother Bobby

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy attorney general,
they went after the Mafia,

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.520 align:middle line:84%
specifically the Mob heads
of Chicago, Tampa, and New

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Orleans and Texas.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And Hoffa.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.866 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: And
Hoffa-- well, Hoffa

00:12:05.866 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:84%
was the ally of all
of those people.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I knew
Hoffa, by the way.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: That's interesting.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.019 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'll get into that.

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: So they actually
went after these guys

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
with a ferocity that
America had never seen

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.470 align:middle line:90%
and has never seen since.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Mafia had a
relationship with Richard Nixon,

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:84%
with the CIA, with a couple
of JFK's girlfriends for sure.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:90%
But JFK and Bobby were dead-set.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.460 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to get rid of the
Mafia in the United States,

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and they put tens of millions
of dollars and hundreds of men

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and women to try and do that.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Leading up to the
assassination on November 22,

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:84%
1963, prior to Kennedy being
elected under the Eisenhower

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.700 align:middle line:84%
administration, they
put the Bay of Pigs

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:90%
plan together to try to do that.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:10%
And the assassination of Fidel
Castro, as you illustrated.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Very important, the
assassination of Fidel Castro.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.505 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All of those, too,
they never seemed to give up.

00:13:01.505 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:10%
Kennedy gets word
about the Bay of Pigs

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:10%
and literally uses
that in debates

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:10%
to destroy Nixon, who
can't admit in the debates

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.390 align:middle line:10%
that something's going on.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So Kennedy looks like
the presidential hero.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going into Cuba,
we're going to do this,

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and we need to do
something like that.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line is
Kennedy takes office,

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and the Bay of Pigs situation,
the invasion of Cuba,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.280 align:middle line:84%
collapses, and they blame
Kennedy for not giving them

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:90%
the air support.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: I'm so glad
you brought that up,

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.720 align:middle line:84%
because that's what I had always
believed, until I spent months

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:84%
digging into just that very
thing for "The Hidden History

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:90%
of Watergate."

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
Bay of Pigs Invasion

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
planned at the time of the
presidential debates in 1960.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.300 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:84%
What there was
was Richard Nixon.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:84%
The election would be
in November of '60.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:84%
In August of '60, Richard Nixon
ordered the Mafia to amp up

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:84%
their assassination attempts
against Fidel Castro that had

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:84%
been going on since '59 and to
basically use the Mafia to kill

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Fidel Castro, gangland style,
before the '60 election,

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:18.070 align:middle line:84%
because he knew that compared
to this young, fresh senator,

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.239 align:middle line:84%
if we had American troops
going into Cuba to keep order--

00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:23.155 align:middle line:84%
because there was a lot
of American companies,

00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:90%
people interest--

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would
help his election.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.445 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Yeah, we would
stick with the experienced vice

00:14:27.445 --> 00:14:30.610 align:middle line:84%
president of eight years instead
of this young, untested--

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:90%
so he ordered that.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So there was no invasion
because there was no need.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there would be a small
force of maybe 100 people

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.690 align:middle line:84%
that would go in to help secure
the government after Fidel

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:90%
was killed.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:47.150 align:middle line:84%
But there was no big invasion
until after the election.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:84%
The head of the CIA, Allen
Dulles, and his number two

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:90%
man--

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who Kennedy fired.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Well,
after the Bay of Pigs.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.835 align:middle line:84%
So after the election,
they were like, well,

00:14:56.835 --> 00:14:58.960 align:middle line:84%
we can't tell the new
president that we were trying

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to help his opponent by hiring
the Mafia to kill Fidel,

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.750 align:middle line:84%
so we'll say, well, we're
going to have this invasion.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So after the invasion,
suddenly this 100-man force

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.850 align:middle line:84%
grows by 10 or 20
fold and becomes

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.050 align:middle line:90%
the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.250 align:middle line:84%
But as you mentioned, Allen
Dulles, the head of the CIA,

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
did not tell JFK,
oh, in addition

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.597 align:middle line:84%
to this invasion
that can never work,

00:15:25.597 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:90%
we're going to kill Fidel.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.054 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what they thought.

00:15:28.054 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, 2,000, 3,000,
however many Cuban exiles,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:84%
they can never conquer Fidel's
100,000-man army and militia.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.713 align:middle line:84%
But if Fidel and his
brother and Che are dead--

00:15:38.713 --> 00:15:40.462 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could
do whatever they want.

00:15:40.462 --> 00:15:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Yeah,
then the president

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:84%
will be forced to
send in the Marines

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:90%
to help maintain control.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:90%
So they kept doing that.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:10%
But involved in
those CIA mafia plots

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:10%
where Johnny Roselli, the
Mafia don of Tampa and much

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:10%
of Florida, Santo
Trafficante, Jr.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And Marcello.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.380 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: And Carlos Marcello
of New Orleans and Texas.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of
all this preparation

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:84%
to assassinate Fidel that JFK
and Bobby know nothing about,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.790 align:middle line:84%
JFK and Bobby have
Marcello, when

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:84%
he goes to it to
register as an alien--

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
because he was born outside
of the United States.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.340 align:middle line:84%
He had a fake Guatemalan
birth certificate.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So he went to register
as a resident alien.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think they sent
him back there, didn't they?

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.555 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into that.

00:16:25.555 --> 00:16:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: They hustled him
on a plane with his attorney

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:90%
and dumped him down there.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
The country they dumped
him in threw him out.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.740 align:middle line:84%
He winds up-- America's most
powerful godfather winds up

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.040 align:middle line:84%
trudging through the jungle
with his attorney in his Gucci

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.037 align:middle line:90%
loafers, swearing total--

00:16:42.037 --> 00:16:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's going to get even.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: You
can't do this to me.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And he sneaks back in, and he's
going to make good on that.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was in doing
that, the plot, the CIA mafia

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:84%
plot to kill Fidel
Castro, got disrupted.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.992 align:middle line:84%
Because Marcello was
out, E. Howard Hunt--

00:17:00.992 --> 00:17:03.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and Castro was
aware of all these things,

00:17:03.325 --> 00:17:04.125 align:middle line:90%
wasn't he?

00:17:04.125 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Well, right
before the Bay of Pigs,

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:84%
he arrested, according to
some estimates, 50,000 people.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who could possibly
be a threat to him,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:90%
he arrested them.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He got rid of them.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: So that
couldn't happen.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.599 align:middle line:84%
E. Howard Hunt was
the CIA's main man

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.910 align:middle line:90%
for the CIA mafia plots.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.369 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to see the
more democratically-minded

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Cuban exiles in.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So he dropped out, along with
his aide, Bernard Barker, who

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:90%
was working for Trafficante.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole CIA Mafia
plot thing didn't happen.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.390 align:middle line:90%
Bay of Pigs failed.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:42.880 align:middle line:10%
JFK fires the head of the CIA,
but the new head of the CIA

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.880 align:middle line:10%
is not told that CIA
official Richard Helms, who

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.380 align:middle line:10%
had kind of escaped the
taint of the plot failure,

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.370 align:middle line:10%
continues those plots.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.911 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He's
continuing the program.

00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:55.494 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Into '62, into '63--

00:17:55.494 --> 00:17:56.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: On their own.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.784 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Not
just until the day

00:17:57.784 --> 00:18:00.670 align:middle line:10%
that JFK died, but
for months after JFK,

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:10%
without telling his
own CIA director

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:10%
or the president
or Robert Kennedy.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So now let's get us
onto that very fateful day

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:90%
on November 22, 1963.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is the motorcade in
Dallas on that fateful day

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.260 align:middle line:90%
in Dealey Plaza.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.560 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, the
motorcade is coming down.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:90%
There he is.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Abraham Zapruder,
an elderly man,

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.690 align:middle line:84%
is standing there with
his 8-millimeter camera,

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
capturing what would be
very capturable nowadays

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.770 align:middle line:84%
with video smart
phones and everything.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And then he gets shot.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And the nation was just
in horror with that.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:84%
If I recall, Lamar, wasn't
it the "Look" magazine story

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:53.309 align:middle line:84%
about the film that got
everybody to know about it?

00:18:53.309 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: It was
actually "Life" magazine.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.141 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Life" magazine.

00:18:56.141 --> 00:18:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: And Dan Rather was
the first reporter to see it.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.870 align:middle line:90%
And he reported it.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.200 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, while
you're showing this,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.470 align:middle line:84%
he reported JFK, because he was,
of course, shot from behind,

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.307 align:middle line:84%
was thrown violently
forward, almost

00:19:08.307 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:84%
into the seat in front of
him, which, of course, doesn't

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.050 align:middle line:90%
happen at all.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:90%
That was just Dan Rather.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But the American public,
aside from a few frames

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:84%
in "Life" magazine
that bought the film

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't let
anyone else use it,

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.380 align:middle line:84%
didn't get to actually see
what we're seeing right now--

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
fatal shot right there.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: --until
mid 1970s when

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Geraldo Rivera put a bootleg
copy on late-night television.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.347 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't even commonly
seen, really, until the 1980s.

00:19:35.347 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I still
have to tell you,

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:84%
looking at that in
slow motion, to me,

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:84%
clearly he was shot from
the front in the head.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: Of course.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:49.130 align:middle line:84%
No doubt at least two
shots came from the front.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:84%
JFK's two closest aides in
the limo right behind him,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.390 align:middle line:84%
perfect view, yeah,
they said the first shot

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and the last shot
came from the front.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Secret
Service was on standby.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:84%
There was a scene of a
Secret Service agent walking

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:84%
alongside, jogging alongside the
limousine, told to stand back.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's putting his
hands up in the air,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:84%
like, what are
you talking about?

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.430 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: And not only Powers
and O'Donnell, the two closest

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
JFK aides in the
limo behind him,

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:84%
but one of the Secret Service
agents in the limo behind JFK

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
also said that at least one
shot came from the front.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt that one
shot came from-- probably

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:90%
at least two came from behind.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:90%
One missed the limo entirely.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And there was that back wound
six inches below JFK's collar.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:84%
That definitely
came from behind.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.730 align:middle line:84%
So there was at least
two shots from behind.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But the two fatal shots
that hit JFK, clearly both

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle line:84%
came from the front, as medical
testimony and evidence and eye

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:84%
witnesses have
shown conclusively.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That it was a
triangular shoot, as they say.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Well, yeah,
he was right there.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was Oswald indeed
a patsy, as he says he was?

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Of course he was,
and not only a patsy for Dallas.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:84%
He was a patsy for
the first two attempts

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.985 align:middle line:84%
to kill JFK in Chicago
three weeks before Dallas.

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there was
one in Florida, right?

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.740 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: And in Tampa,
Florida, four days

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.989 align:middle line:10%
before Dallas.

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Each of those two attempts
had their own patsies.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:29.010 align:middle line:84%
There was another ex-Marine
in Chicago arrested

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:84%
the morning of the
planned-- he had just

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:90%
gotten this troubled ex-Marine.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:90%
He had a rifle.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:90%
He had a pistol.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:84%
He had 3,000 rounds
of ammunition.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.350 align:middle line:84%
He had just gotten a job
at a warehouse overlooking

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:84%
JFK's motorcade route,
many parallels to Oswald.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:84%
They moved to YMCAs
at the same time.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Thomas Vallee was his name.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.360 align:middle line:90%
He was going to be the patsy.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.485 align:middle line:84%
But if something had
happened to Thomas Vallee,

00:21:54.485 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:84%
there had already
been an attempt

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.050 align:middle line:84%
to leak Oswald to
Chicago, and I'm

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:84%
sure they would have
gotten Oswald to Chicago

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:90%
on that Saturday.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:84%
But the Secret Service,
including Abraham Bolden,

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
the first African-American
presidential Secret Service

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.010 align:middle line:84%
agent, they had found out
that there was an attempt.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:84%
So JFK didn't just
cancel his motorcade

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.300 align:middle line:84%
at the last minute,
his press secretary

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Pierre Salinger told me, but
he canceled the entire trip

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.994 align:middle line:84%
because they knew that
there were at least--

00:22:24.994 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was too violent.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Well, there were
two assassins at large,

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:84%
potentially four, and plus
this Vallee, the ex-Marine,

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:90%
had been arrested.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:35.670 align:middle line:90%
Now he would be a patsy as well.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Flash head to Tampa, Florida.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Oswald, as we should all
know, had no driver's license

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:42.810 align:middle line:90%
and no car.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was
living hand to mouth.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:90%
So he couldn't drive.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
He had no money
for a plane ticket.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:90%
But in Tampa, Florida--

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he here, too?

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Well,
there was a report

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:84%
that surfaced later from an FBI
informant that he was in Tampa.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:10%
The reason was there was a guy
with two dozen similarities

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:10%
to Oswald, Gilberto Policarpo
Lopez, approximately

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.180 align:middle line:10%
the same age, approximately
same physical description,

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:10%
a Cuban exile in Tampa.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:10%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --the picture
of Oswald coming out

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:10%
of the Mexican embassy?

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.880 align:middle line:10%
Remember that picture?

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: It's not that
person, but you'll be surprised.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Gilberto Lopez, just as
Oswald made a strange trip

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
to the Mexican embassy trying
to get into Cuba two months

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.480 align:middle line:84%
before the assassination,
Gilberto Lopez

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.350 align:middle line:84%
would make a similar trip
after the assassination.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Gilberto Lopez left his wife
the same time as Oswald,

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:84%
got involved with
fair play for Cuba

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:84%
same time as Oswald--
so many parallels.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.950 align:middle line:84%
But again, if anything had
happened to Gilberto Lopez

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.447 align:middle line:84%
so he couldn't be
the patsy, somebody

00:23:49.447 --> 00:23:50.530 align:middle line:90%
was laying the groundwork.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Oswald is--

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
the back-up patsy.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: Right.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Oswald's whereabouts on
the Sunday before Dallas,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.930 align:middle line:84%
which is the Sunday before
the Tampa attempt as well,

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.360 align:middle line:90%
are totally unknown to this day.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And he was probably
being kept on ice

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:84%
in case they needed
to take him to Tampa.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
But as the Tampa chief
of police told me,

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.322 align:middle line:84%
and a contemporary
news article bears out,

00:24:12.322 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:84%
the Tampa police
and Secret Service

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
found out about the
assassination attempt

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:19.110 align:middle line:90%
against JFK in Tampa.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But JFK was giving a very
important speech that night

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
to an ally very high in
the Cuban government,

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
getting ready to
overthrow Fidel Castro.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:32.470 align:middle line:10%
So JFK couldn't very well
cancel this motorcade in Tampa,

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:10%
give that speech in
Florida with words

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.770 align:middle line:10%
the CIA had helped
him craft, designed

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.290 align:middle line:10%
to reassure the number-three
man in Cuba that he

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.820 align:middle line:10%
should overthrow Fidel.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And so JFK went through
with that motorcade.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Jackie was not there--
very, very tense.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at the
place the assassination

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
was planned for in Tampa,
or the Floridan Hotel.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.320 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the Texas School
Book Depository, only twice

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.965 align:middle line:84%
as big, every window opened,
the hotel was packed.

00:25:01.965 --> 00:25:03.340 align:middle line:84%
The chief of police
told me there

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:90%
was no way we could secure it.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.610 align:middle line:84%
There was a hard left turn just
like in Dallas under the School

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:10.410 align:middle line:90%
Book Depository.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.451 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is where
the shot would have been.

00:25:12.451 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: And in
fact, the shooting--

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:19.530 align:middle line:10%
you could tell
the Floridan Hotel

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:10%
was one block farther away from
that turn than the School Book

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.630 align:middle line:10%
Depository.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But you'll notice the shooting
doesn't start in Dallas

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.430 align:middle line:84%
until the limo is pretty far
away from the School Book

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Depository in the
exact place it would

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:84%
have been if the assassination
had occurred in Tampa.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So the assassins had
been practicing first

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.360 align:middle line:84%
for Chicago, then
for Tampa, and that's

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:84%
why they waited--
because you could

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
have shot JFK when he was taking
that turn under the School Book

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Depository.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.000 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't-- Dallas was
the backup plan for the backup

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:52.800 align:middle line:90%
plan.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.841 align:middle line:90%
It had all been planned--

00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there
another plan after Dallas

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.260 align:middle line:90%
if that didn't succeed?

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: There was
no plan after Dallas,

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:90%
so it had to succeed.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.580 align:middle line:84%
The coup in Cuba
that JFK was backing

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:84%
with the head of the Cuban
army was set for December 1,

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.367 align:middle line:84%
not long after Dallas
on November 27.

00:26:11.367 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that was
called off, obviously.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.029 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: Obviously called off.

00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason for
so much of the secrecy.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So no, it had to
occur in Dallas.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:84%
But get this-- so
most people don't

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.330 align:middle line:84%
realize that JFK Secret
Service detail went out

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:28.290 align:middle line:84%
drinking in Fort
Worth till 2:00 AM,

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:32.940 align:middle line:84%
4:00 AM, 5:00 AM on the night
before the assassination,

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.082 align:middle line:84%
not exactly what you need
to have great reflexes.

00:26:37.082 --> 00:26:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're all hung over.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Well,
not all, but some.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was an associate of Jack
Ruby's that ran this place.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Some of Ruby's
strippers came over.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They all
know everybody.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: And
so-- but the reason

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.465 align:middle line:84%
they all went out
drinking, though--

00:26:56.465 --> 00:26:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and I do want to
make this clear,

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.298 align:middle line:84%
because I think
most Secret Service

00:26:59.298 --> 00:27:00.660 align:middle line:90%
agents try to do a good job.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.290 align:middle line:90%
And they risk they lives.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with that.

00:27:02.415 --> 00:27:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: And there had been
the big threat in Chicago.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.560 align:middle line:10%
JFK had to cancel not just the
motorcade, but the whole trip.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But they knew then,
something's going on here.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.269 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Well, but get this.

00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So in Tampa, they knew
active shooter, OK?

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta say the lookout
in Tampa, the alert listed

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:84%
was much closer to Oswald
than first lookout in Dallas.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were the
shooters in Tampa the same

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.665 align:middle line:90%
that went to Dallas?

00:27:24.665 --> 00:27:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Yeah, I mean,
they're the same shooters.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's one plan, shoot JFK
from a tall building overlooking

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:84%
that kind of left turn,
in three cities, one plan.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But the Secret Service, there
was no active threat in Dallas.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So after those two
tense situations

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.960 align:middle line:84%
in Chicago and Tampa,
they did feel like, OK, we

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.006 align:middle line:90%
can kick back and relax.

00:27:50.006 --> 00:27:51.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ah, they
let their guard down.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: And that also told
Marcelo's associates in Dallas,

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:10%
OK, the fact that they're
going out drinking late

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.640 align:middle line:10%
instead of being
super alert means,

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.860 align:middle line:10%
OK, finally we can
do-- because it was

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:10%
their third and last chance.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:84%
This had to happen
before December 1,

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.675 align:middle line:84%
because it was that
secret coup plan that

00:28:11.675 --> 00:28:13.050 align:middle line:84%
was going to force
the government

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:18.150 align:middle line:84%
to cover up so much then and
later and now to prevent World

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:90%
War III.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me
ask you questions.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Give me yes or no
answers specifically.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Was the Mob involved in
Kennedy's assassination?

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: Definitely.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.382 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The CIA?

00:28:29.382 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: What we
can say right now is--

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes or no?

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: --at a lower level.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So the CIA not at a high level,
but what I would call a medium

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:38.850 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Secret Service?

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: No.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some members
of government--

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:84%
did they know
about it, like LBJ?

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: No, and later
on I can explain why.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.869 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
Castro-- was he involved?

00:28:51.869 --> 00:28:52.785 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: Not at all.

00:28:52.785 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
so primarily you're

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.830 align:middle line:90%
saying it was Mob-driven.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.510 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: And we have to
remember that the three

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:04.620 align:middle line:10%
mobsters who later confessed,
three Mob leaders who later

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.120 align:middle line:10%
confessed their roles-- because
there are other confessions,

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.290 align:middle line:10%
but the three Mob leaders,
Marcello of Louisiana

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.050 align:middle line:10%
and Texas, Trafficante of
Florida, and Johnny Roselli,

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.050 align:middle line:10%
the Chicago Mafia's man in LA--

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All dead now.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.120 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: All dead.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:25.050 align:middle line:10%
But they all confessed, but they
were all CIA assets in the CIA

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:25.920 align:middle line:10%
Mafia plots--

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: To kill Castro.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: So what they
were able to do was use--

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.200 align:middle line:84%
so when Jack Ruby meets
with Johnny Roselli in Miami

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:39.060 align:middle line:84%
in October of 1963, the
FBI has to back off,

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.910 align:middle line:84%
because the CIA
is like, oh, hey,

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.061 align:middle line:84%
Roselli is working for us, so
back off on your surveillance.

00:29:44.061 --> 00:29:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's one of our guys.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.518 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: And so we have
all this great surveillance

00:29:47.518 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:84%
on Johnny Roselli in the fall of
'63, except when he's in Miami.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.550 align:middle line:90%
That's never been released.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:90%
And he's meeting with Jack Ruby.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.980 align:middle line:84%
They think it's
about killing Castro,

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.560 align:middle line:90%
but no, it's about killing JFK.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So those three Mobsters,
they were all CIA assets,

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:07.140 align:middle line:84%
but they were basically
playing the CIA leaders,

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.440 align:middle line:84%
like Richard Helms, the
number-three man in the CIA.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.860 align:middle line:84%
He was the highest guy that even
knew about the CIA Mafia plots

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:90%
in '63.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:84%
JFK CIA director John
McCone, he liked JFK.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:84%
He knew nothing about
CIA Mafia plots.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:10%
He and his number-two man,
they were out of the loop.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.950 align:middle line:10%
It was Richard Helms who would
later become head of the CIA.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:32.160 align:middle line:10%
He was keeping all that
from his bosses in the CIA

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.430 align:middle line:10%
and from JFK and from Bobby,
because he figured, well,

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.620 align:middle line:10%
once Castro is dead, nobody
is going to mind anyway.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
those lower-level people

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:45.420 align:middle line:84%
in the CIA, three of whom
essentially confessed--

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:84%
David Morales the head of
operations at the Miami CIA

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.130 align:middle line:90%
station.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The largest CIA
station in the world

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:90%
was not in some foreign country.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.440 align:middle line:90%
It was in Miami.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Miami, yeah.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: And the ruthless
chief of operations

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.210 align:middle line:84%
there was a guy named
David Morales, who

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.800 align:middle line:84%
was best friends
with Johnny Roselli.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And so Morales was involved
with the CIA Mafia plots,

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.740 align:middle line:84%
like his good friend
Johnny Roselli.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.936 align:middle line:84%
But Morales hated JFK
because of the Bay of Pigs.

00:31:13.936 --> 00:31:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Again, the Bay of Pigs didn't
fail because of airstrikes.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:20.730 align:middle line:84%
It failed because Castro
wasn't assassinated by the CIA.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.800 align:middle line:90%
But Morales blamed JFK.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So Morales later on confessed
that he was involved.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.959 align:middle line:84%
E. Howard Hunt, a
name most of your--

00:31:29.959 --> 00:31:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who apparently
told his son.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't there a deathbed
confession here

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:34.800 align:middle line:90%
of his involvement?

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.140 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Well, Hunt's
so-called confession

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.460 align:middle line:10%
is more troubling.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's because he left out
the fact that his chief aide

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.270 align:middle line:84%
during Watergate and in the
early '60s and in the CIA Mafia

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.335 align:middle line:84%
plot, Bernard Barker,
was a longtime--

00:31:51.335 --> 00:31:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are all
Watergate people. [LAUGHING]

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.793 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: All Watergate people.

00:31:54.793 --> 00:31:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Bernard Barker had been
working for the Mafia

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.005 align:middle line:84%
since the late 1940s and was
working for Santo Trafficante.

00:32:01.005 --> 00:32:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Hunt himself, when the CIA
Mafia plot started in '60,

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.950 align:middle line:90%
he had no Mafia background.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.580 align:middle line:84%
He was an expert in overthrowing
foreign governments-- no Mafia

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.380 align:middle line:90%
background.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.189 align:middle line:84%
So the CIA said, look,
here's this Bernard Barker.

00:32:12.189 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:84%
He's been working with
the Mafia for years.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:84%
He's working with
Trafficante already.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Work with him.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.060 align:middle line:84%
So Hunt left that out
of his confession.

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
He left out the fact that
his best friend, a guy

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.760 align:middle line:84%
named Manuel Artime, one of
the leaders of the Bay of Pigs,

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.770 align:middle line:84%
who later became
a drug trafficker

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.300 align:middle line:84%
for Santo Trafficante--
this is Hunt's best friend.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And Artime also
provided the hush money

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.060 align:middle line:90%
for the Watergate burglars.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.930 align:middle line:10%
He was a drug trafficker
for Santo Trafficante.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:42.810 align:middle line:10%
Hunt in his so-called confession
tried to blame everything,

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:46.290 align:middle line:10%
or a lot, on-- well, he
just named various people,

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:49.207 align:middle line:10%
and he put Frank Sturgis,
real name Frank Fiorini--

00:32:49.207 --> 00:32:50.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He was
involved in Watergate.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:54.810 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Well, but Frank--
I call him Frank Firoini

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:56.910 align:middle line:10%
because that's his real
name, not Frank Sturgis.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Frank Fiorini was also
working for Santo Trafficante.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So we keep coming
back to the fact

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:07.200 align:middle line:84%
that-- so Hunt didn't mention
a word about the Mafia,

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.320 align:middle line:84%
even though he helped to
start the CIA Mafia plots.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.060 align:middle line:84%
His assistant and
his best friend

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:84%
were both totally working
for Santo Trafficante.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.040 align:middle line:90%
So did Hunt have a role?

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I have to put a question
mark there right now.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Because he left so much
out of his confession.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Another guy by the name of John
Martino, a CIA asset in '63,

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.290 align:middle line:90%
he later confessed as well.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And he also worked
for Trafficante

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and was working on
these CIA Mafia plots.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So people now, we all know that
governments and our government

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.911 align:middle line:84%
tries to assassinate
foreign leaders.

00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Hell, we try to do it
with a drone, right?

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They did it during
the Kennedy administration.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: The general public,
though, they did not really

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.510 align:middle line:90%
find that out until 1975.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the secrecy
surrounding JFK's murder

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:59.130 align:middle line:84%
was about keeping the fact
that we were-- and even JFK,

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.530 align:middle line:84%
he didn't view what the
head of the Cuban army

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.540 align:middle line:84%
was going to do to
Fidel as assassination.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:07.350 align:middle line:84%
He viewed it as a coup attempt
to try to get Cuba back

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:10.210 align:middle line:84%
on the road to democracy that
Castro had taken it away from.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or back to the Mob.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget all
those casinos that

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:16.170 align:middle line:90%
went when they got Batista out.

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Two important
things to remember-- one--

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.919 align:middle line:84%
and I got this from several
of the two dozen people that

00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:23.710 align:middle line:84%
worked closely with
John and Robert Kennedy

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:28.350 align:middle line:84%
that Tom and I interviewed--
JFK and Bobby had banned

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:32.730 align:middle line:84%
the Mafia from any
role in their coup plan

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:36.929 align:middle line:84%
and from having any role in
Cuba after the coup happened.

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:39.207 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hence a reason to
get rid of Kennedy, right?

00:34:39.207 --> 00:34:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Before the
date that the coup was

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.600 align:middle line:84%
supposed to happen,
shortly after Dallas.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, "The New York Times"
the week before JFK was killed,

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.150 align:middle line:84%
they ran a big cover
feature, I think

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:50.489 align:middle line:84%
four or five days,
of the US was getting

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:54.510 align:middle line:84%
ready to go into Las Vegas and
run the Mafia out of Las Vegas.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.540 align:middle line:90%
The Mob no longer had Havana.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had no
place left to go.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Carlos Marcello
was not a citizen.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:00.520 align:middle line:90%
He could be deported.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
they cleaned up Vegas.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.670 align:middle line:90%
They got them all out.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Well,
they eventually did.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eventually.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: And so the Mafia's
back was against the wall.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.840 align:middle line:84%
They had nothing to gain by
letting the coup go forward,

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.490 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't
get back in Cuba.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:15.450 align:middle line:84%
They had everything to gain
by using the intense secrecy

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:19.290 align:middle line:84%
surrounding this coup plan that
only a dozen people in the US

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.930 align:middle line:84%
government really
knew much about.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:23.040 align:middle line:90%
It was that secret.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But get this-- six
people who worked

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.440 align:middle line:84%
for Marcello and
Trafficante, we can document

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.950 align:middle line:84%
through quotes, from
printed sources,

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.787 align:middle line:84%
knew about that
secret coup plan.

00:35:33.787 --> 00:35:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So the coup plan that Congress
has never been officially

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.330 align:middle line:84%
told about, six people
working for the Mafia

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.890 align:middle line:84%
were able to weasel their
way in and find out,

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:45.150 align:middle line:84%
again because people
like E. Howard Hunt

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:84%
was working on the coup plan,
unknown to the Kennedys.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.250 align:middle line:84%
He was working on
the same Mafia plots,

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and his aide Bernard Barker,
all the time his real loyalty

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.840 align:middle line:90%
is to the Mafia.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So he's able to-- so
everything that Hunt knew,

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.160 align:middle line:90%
his aide Barker knew.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Everything Barker knew, his real
boss Santo Trafficante knew.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
the murder of Jimmy Hoffa

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.072 align:middle line:84%
in 1975 had anything
to do with this?

00:36:07.072 --> 00:36:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Oh, it's
totally, totally connected.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:11.196 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, that just
took place several weeks

00:36:11.196 --> 00:36:14.510 align:middle line:84%
after Sam Giancana
was assassinated.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.680 align:middle line:10%
Remember, the general
public knew nothing

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.950 align:middle line:10%
about any US government
assassinating anybody

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:23.520 align:middle line:10%
until '75, early in '75.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.710 align:middle line:84%
President Ford let
something slip.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Daniel Schorr dug into it.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly there was the
Senate Church Committee.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And there was also a House
committee. [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:84%
But the Senate Church Committee
starts investigating this,

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and they're calling witnesses,
and they're dragging

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Richard Helms up to testify.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And Helms is so mad at one
point he practically tries

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to strangle newsman
Daniel Schorr after one

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.850 align:middle line:84%
of these hearings, saying you
don't know what you've done,

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:51.480 align:middle line:90%
people are going to get killed.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody would find
out for decades after that

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:59.160 align:middle line:84%
that the number-three man in
Cuba was still working for us.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.240 align:middle line:10%
But what happened was--

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now where is that guy?

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.950 align:middle line:10%
Is he dead?

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:06.270 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: He didn't
die until 9/11, 2009.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that's been
the CIA's excuse

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.671 align:middle line:90%
for keeping everything secret.

00:37:10.671 --> 00:37:12.420 align:middle line:84%
But what they really
wanted to keep secret

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.240 align:middle line:84%
were those CIA mafia plots
that backfired on Kennedy.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
Jimmy Hoffa starts

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:84%
talking to staffers for the
Senate Church Committee,

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.520 align:middle line:84%
investigating the
CIA Mafia plots.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.642 align:middle line:84%
And Jimmy Hoffa is
leaking them information.

00:37:29.642 --> 00:37:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, he would know.

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:31.890 align:middle line:90%
He was part of them.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:33.848 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: He was part
of the same Mafia plots.

00:37:33.848 --> 00:37:37.704 align:middle line:90%
He had become part in 1959.

00:37:37.704 --> 00:37:39.120 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, there
was a big bribe

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.010 align:middle line:10%
to him paid by Nixon when
Trafficante, Marcello,

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.530 align:middle line:10%
and Roselli got involved
in August of '60.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Hoffa built Las Vegas.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.360 align:middle line:10%
I mean, his Teamster pension
fund went to the Mob.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: Exactly.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.640 align:middle line:90%
They built it.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
were out of control.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: So he
knew all of us stuff.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And he was mad at Nixon
for putting that condition

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.900 align:middle line:84%
on his release that he could
not head the Teamsters again.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So he was leaking
information to them.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.000 align:middle line:84%
They got wind
about Sam Giancana,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and then someone that
Sam Giancana knew

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:16.140 align:middle line:90%
was able to go into his house.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And Giancana, your
viewers need to realize,

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.600 align:middle line:84%
he had been in exile in
Mexico for many, many years.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.950 align:middle line:90%
He was much too flamboyant.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:26.520 align:middle line:84%
He was never
actually a godfather.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.790 align:middle line:10%
He was a mob boss,
not a godfather.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:84%
He'd had to go into
exile in Mexico for--

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was a
tough guy in Chicago.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:32.870 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Right.

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:34.960 align:middle line:10%
So he had finally come back.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And he was like fixing
dinner late one night,

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.470 align:middle line:90%
some sausages I believe.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:40.270 align:middle line:90%
And he lets--

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:41.103 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:41.103 --> 00:38:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: He lets somebody
who he knew and trusted.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Into his house.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: And he
is assassinated,

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and he's shot several
times around the mouth.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's the Mafia
sign for don't talk.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't want
him or anyone else

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:57.180 align:middle line:84%
talking to that Senate
Church Committee.

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:01.600 align:middle line:84%
But then when we get
to the end of July,

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.140 align:middle line:84%
one thing I have in the
book, the "History of the JFK

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Assassination,"
is sometime prior

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.620 align:middle line:90%
to Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance--

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
in July of '75.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: July of '75,
sometime prior to that--

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.160 align:middle line:84%
we don't know exactly whether
it's days, weeks, or a month,

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.580 align:middle line:84%
but sometime prior to that,
according to the FBI informant,

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:29.490 align:middle line:84%
according to Marcello himself
talking to an FBI informant,

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:35.430 align:middle line:84%
he had Hoffa brought in a
private plane down to his huge

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:39.040 align:middle line:84%
1,000-plus-acre Churchill
Farms in Louisiana.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Had its own airstrip,
had one house

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:43.470 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of it, alligators.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:47.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you didn't go into
there unless Marcello wanted you

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:47.940 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:48.900 align:middle line:90%
There was no bugging.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:49.950 align:middle line:90%
There were no wiretaps.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people could
come and go at leisure

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.440 align:middle line:84%
because they had
their own airstrip.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.725 align:middle line:84%
And so he and another mob
boss, Tony Provenzano,

00:39:58.725 --> 00:40:01.100 align:middle line:84%
who had also been on the fringe
of the same Mafia plots--

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.141 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who was the guy
Hoffa was supposed to be

00:40:03.141 --> 00:40:04.800 align:middle line:90%
meeting when he disappeared.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: Right.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So Provenzano, Hoffa,
and Marcello meet,

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and basically Marcello
tries to convince Hoffa not

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.730 align:middle line:84%
to pursue any kind
of court action

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:18.810 align:middle line:84%
to have the
conviction overturned.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To come back.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Come back and
take over the Teamsters.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:25.350 align:middle line:90%
And Hoffa refuses to back down.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.744 align:middle line:84%
So Provenzano in
private tells Marcello,

00:40:27.744 --> 00:40:29.660 align:middle line:84%
we should just go ahead
and kill him here, not

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.330 align:middle line:90%
even let him go back.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:35.080 align:middle line:84%
It appears he was
allowed to go back.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:35.910 align:middle line:90%
But then he was--

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then the plan was--

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:37.911 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: He was killed.

00:40:37.911 --> 00:40:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I should point out the
last known communication

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.350 align:middle line:84%
from Jimmy Hoffa before
his disappearance,

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:50.810 align:middle line:84%
he does say he is going to the
airport near the small town

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:52.287 align:middle line:90%
where he disappeared.

00:40:52.287 --> 00:40:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bloomfield.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: So some
people do wonder, well,

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.970 align:middle line:84%
did he actually go to the
airport, go to Churchill Farms,

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.640 align:middle line:90%
and was he really killed there?

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Because-- most of your viewers
will not know because the FBI

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:07.720 align:middle line:84%
won't release the files,
but I have the summary

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.910 align:middle line:84%
from the FBI and
the FBI informant.

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:15.710 align:middle line:84%
The FBI did investigate
junkyards in New Orleans

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:16.510 align:middle line:90%
to see if Hoffa--

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was dumped there?

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.118 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: --wound up
being dumped there.

00:41:19.118 --> 00:41:21.740 align:middle line:10%
Because Marcello
did own a junkyard

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.350 align:middle line:10%
where bodies were disposed of.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.016 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah, we
always thought that he

00:41:25.016 --> 00:41:27.640 align:middle line:10%
was crushed somewhere in some
old piece of metal scrap heap,

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.450 align:middle line:10%
and he's gone.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.033 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: So could
he still be there?

00:41:30.033 --> 00:41:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, Hoffa's death,
and then and then

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:36.644 align:middle line:84%
Johnny Roselli's murder about
a year after Hoffa shortly

00:41:36.644 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:84%
after he had met with
Trafficante-- you gottta

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.020 align:middle line:84%
remember, in the
feeding order here,

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.490 align:middle line:84%
you got Marcello and
Trafficante at the top,

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:48.520 align:middle line:84%
you got people like Sam Giancana
and Johnny Roselli below that,

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and then Hoffa is even below
Marcello and Trafficante.

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lamar, as we wrap this
incredible story, this weaving

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:02.200 align:middle line:84%
of the assassination of Kennedy,
in your opinion, quite frankly,

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.120 align:middle line:90%
why did they kill him?

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: They had no choice.

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.450 align:middle line:84%
They had to kill him
before December 1

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.750 align:middle line:84%
to use the secret coup
plan, all the secrecy

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.950 align:middle line:84%
surrounding that that would
continue for decades to prevent

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:17.030 align:middle line:84%
a thorough investigation
of JFK's murder,

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:20.140 align:middle line:84%
plus they did plant
clues pointing to Fidel,

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.030 align:middle line:84%
so people thought it
would be World War

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:25.600 align:middle line:84%
III if it looked like Cuba
or the Russians had done it.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So they were smart
in that regard.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:90%
But they had no choice.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.581 align:middle line:84%
Roselli and Marcello
were not even citizens.

00:42:31.581 --> 00:42:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Even a small conviction
would get them deported.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Marcello was literally
in federal court

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:40.080 align:middle line:84%
facing Bobby's
federal prosecutor

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:84%
that I spoke with in the
weeks before JFK's murder.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.300 align:middle line:84%
He had bribed a juror to
ensure his acquittal that day.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But they could put him back
on trial on new charges

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.200 align:middle line:90%
a week later.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.030 align:middle line:90%
So they had no choice.

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.510 align:middle line:90%
They had to do it.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:58.049 align:middle line:84%
And killing JFK, it didn't end
the US war against the Mafia,

00:42:58.049 --> 00:42:59.840 align:middle line:84%
because as you pointed
out, they eventually

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:84%
did get the Mafia
out of Las Vegas.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But it put a severe
dent into it.

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, if you
look politically,

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:09.640 align:middle line:84%
as I did for the Watergate
book, most people

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.950 align:middle line:84%
would have guessed that Richard
Nixon was going to be president

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:14.050 align:middle line:90%
in the '64 election.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he had
narrowly lost in '60.

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:84%
It would be him, and
if not him, someone

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.270 align:middle line:90%
like Nelson Rockefeller.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Barry Goldwater
ran during that time.

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: Right.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:27.310 align:middle line:84%
People were shocked that
he was able to get it.

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Lyndon Johnson had become
a political nobody.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:31.970 align:middle line:84%
He had been very
powerful in the '50s.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.360 align:middle line:90%
He was kind of a nobody.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So people were very
surprised in that regard.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.410 align:middle line:84%
But again, Tom and
I, we start out--

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.510 align:middle line:84%
we investigate everybody--
Hoover, Hoffa--

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you've
got all the names.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.931 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Johnson and
all the-- but again,

00:43:44.931 --> 00:43:47.622 align:middle line:84%
Lyndon Johnson, there's the
evidence from Madeleine Brown

00:43:47.622 --> 00:43:49.580 align:middle line:84%
that he was supposedly
at a meeting that night.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he wasn't upset
that Kennedy was assassinated.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he wasn't upset.

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: He wasn't upset.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.860 align:middle line:90%
And I do want to point this out.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.890 align:middle line:90%
He liked JFK.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:02.050 align:middle line:90%
By '63 he liked JFK.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.850 align:middle line:84%
They had been enemies
for the '60 election.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:05.016 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah, they were.

00:44:05.016 --> 00:44:06.970 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: They rivals.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And he was named VP
only because he needed Texas.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:10.310 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Right.

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:15.310 align:middle line:10%
But by '63, LBJ had
treated him pretty well.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Lyndon Johnson did
hate Robert Kennedy.

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:20.080 align:middle line:84%
He hated Robert
Kennedy with a passion.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So under JFK, Robert Kennedy
basically ran Cuban operations.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And then when LBJ
becomes president

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and he finds out
about the coup plan

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and eventually he finds out
about the CIA Mafia plots,

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:35.720 align:middle line:90%
he shuts all that stuff down.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And by then, we're
too entrenched in Vietnam.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.150 align:middle line:90%
It was a disaster.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: Well, and
it goes beyond that.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.720 align:middle line:84%
LBJ actually said
Bobby made an attempt

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.970 align:middle line:84%
to get Lyndon
Johnson to continue

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:50.116 align:middle line:84%
the coup plan with
the number three,

00:44:50.116 --> 00:44:52.490 align:middle line:84%
the head of the Cuban army,
Commander [INAUDIBLE] in Cuba

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:55.600 align:middle line:90%
in January of '63.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And he meets with Robert
Kennedy and another one

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:02.020 align:middle line:84%
of the Cuban exile leaders
that was part of the coup plan.

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:06.699 align:middle line:84%
And Lyndon basically
says, look, I'm

00:45:06.699 --> 00:45:08.240 align:middle line:84%
not going to have
another Bay of Pigs

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.990 align:middle line:84%
in the first couple of
months of my administration.

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And Lyndon Johnson
decides then, I'm

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.720 align:middle line:84%
going to just keep
hands off Cuba,

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to make
my stand in Vietnam.

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So when the Gulf of
Tonkin incident happens,

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:23.770 align:middle line:84%
which wasn't a set-up,
but LBJ was basically

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:27.850 align:middle line:84%
looking for an excuse to
greatly expand our role.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Because he couldn't
do it with Cuba.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it may
not have been a set-up,

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.235 align:middle line:84%
but it may have been
magnified a little bit.

00:45:32.235 --> 00:45:33.401 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDRON: Oh, tremendously.

00:45:33.401 --> 00:45:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, he was
looking for an excuse,

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.510 align:middle line:90%
and he was given that excuse.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And then within a few days,
they realized they had,

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.220 align:middle line:84%
like you said,
magnified, overreacted.

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But by then, he had what
he wanted, and he thought,

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:48.080 align:middle line:84%
hey, we'd be wrapped up in
Vietnam in a couple of years.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In 30 seconds,
the files we have not seen

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:53.040 align:middle line:90%
on the Kennedy assassination--

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: And there
are hundreds of files.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What might they be?

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDRON: They are Naval
Intelligence, surveillance

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:02.360 align:middle line:84%
on Oswald from the time he
came back from the Soviet Union

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.300 align:middle line:84%
through the day of the
assassination, the secret Naval

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Marine
investigation of Oswald that

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.490 align:middle line:84%
cleared Oswald of any role in
the assassination, the fact

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.910 align:middle line:84%
that Oswald was a US
intelligence asset when he went

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:20.830 align:middle line:84%
there, Carlos Marcello
in federal prison in 1985

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:24.640 align:middle line:84%
talking about Oswald,
talking about Ruby,

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.930 align:middle line:84%
how they were working for
him and that he secretly

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:32.800 align:middle line:84%
owned Jack Ruby's club, all
the stuff about the CIA Mafia

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.110 align:middle line:84%
plots, more about
the confessions.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So just think of all
those tapes of Marcello

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:40.700 align:middle line:84%
talking to a trusted FBI
informant about Oswald and Ruby

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and David Ferrie
and so much more.

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:44.190 align:middle line:90%
We don't have those tapes.

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:44.990 align:middle line:90%
We should.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The law says we
should have those.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And your viewers,
you've just got

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:52.930 align:middle line:84%
to lean on your members of
Congress and the Senate to say,

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:57.140 align:middle line:84%
hey, a law was passed,
the JFK Act in 1992

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.660 align:middle line:90%
to release all the files.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:02.240 align:middle line:10%
A few files were allowed to
be kept secret till 2017.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.370 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be 2017.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:05.470 align:middle line:84%
They released the lists of the
files they're going to release,

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:07.865 align:middle line:84%
all the most important files
about the Tampa attempt.

00:47:07.865 --> 00:47:08.160 align:middle line:90%
We have nothing.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I've got to tell
you, it's the end of Camelot,

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:11.260 align:middle line:90%
wasn't it?

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.120 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDRON: Totally the
end of Camelot, but like I

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.660 align:middle line:10%
say, your viewers,
if they'll press

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.300 align:middle line:10%
their members of Congress,
maybe we can get those files

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.340 align:middle line:10%
so you and I can get to read
them and know everything

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.140 align:middle line:10%
finally.

the assassination of our

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.150 align:middle line:10%
It continues to haunt us today.
